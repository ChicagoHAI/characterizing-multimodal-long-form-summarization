QAD Enterprise Applications support operational requirements in the areas of financials, customer management, supply chain, manufacturing, service and support, analytics, business process management and integration. QAD's portfolio also includes related solutions for quality management software, supply chain management software, transportation management software and business-to-business interoperability. QAD solutions support customers in the automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology, industrial manufacturing and life sciences industries to streamline processes, improve operational performance, comply with regulatory requirements and meet industry standards.\nWe have four principal sources of revenue:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Subscription of Enterprise Applications through our cloud offering in a Software as a Service ( SaaS\u201d) model as well as other hosted applications;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> License purchases of Enterprise Applications;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Maintenance and support, including technical support, training materials, product enhancements and upgrades; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Professional services, including implementations, technical and application consulting, training, migrations and upgrades.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe operate primarily in the following four geographic regions: North America, Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. In fiscal 2019, approximately 48% of our total revenue was generated in North America, 30% in EMEA, 15% in Asia Pacific and 7% in Latin America. The majority of our revenue is generated from global customers who have operations in multiple countries throughout the world. A significant portion of our revenue and expenses are derived from international operations which are primarily conducted in foreign currencies. As a result, changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar have impacted our results of operations and may impact our future results of operations. At January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 1,970 employees worldwide, of which 650 employees were based in North America, 610 employees in EMEA, 600 employees in Asia Pacific and 110 employees in Latin America.\nOur customer base and our target markets are primarily global manufacturing companies; therefore, our results are heavily influenced by the state of the manufacturing economy on a global basis. As a result, our management team monitors several economic indicators, with particular attention to the Global and Country Purchasing Managers' Indexes ( PMI\u201d). The PMI is a survey conducted on a monthly basis by polling businesses that represent the makeup of respective sectors. Since most of our customers are manufacturers, our revenue has historically correlated with fluctuations in the manufacturing PMI. Global macro-economic trends and manufacturing spending are important barometers for our business, and the health of the U.S., Western European and Asian economies have a meaningful impact on our financial results.\nWe are transitioning our business model from selling perpetual licenses to providing access to our software on a subscription basis as part of our cloud offering. During fiscal 2019, we closed most of our new customer deals in the cloud. In addition, we converted many of our existing customers from on-premises licenses to our cloud based solution. Recurring revenue, which we define as subscription revenue plus maintenance revenue, accounted for 65% of total revenue for fiscal 2019. By reducing our customers' up-front costs and providing continuous application and infrastructure support, we expect our cloud business model will be more attractive than perpetual licenses. We expect recurring revenue to remain a majority of total revenue as our subscription revenue continues to grow.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe operate in several geographical regions as described in Note 12 Business Segment Information\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In order to present our results of operations without the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we provide certain financial information on a constant currency basis\u201d, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented in the following tables. In order to calculate our constant currency results, we apply the current foreign currency exchange rates to the prior period results.\nRevenue\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year

On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $333.0 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $27.5 million, or 9%, increase from $305.5 million for fiscal 2018. When comparing categories within total revenue at constant rates, our results for fiscal 2019 included increases in subscription and professional services revenue partially offset by a decrease in license and maintenance and other revenue. In fiscal 2019, one customer accounted for 10% of total revenue and no other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. Revenue outside the North America region as a percentage of total revenue was 52% and 54% for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. Our products are sold to manufacturing companies that operate mainly in the following six industries: automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology, industrial products and life sciences. Given the similarities between consumer products and food and beverage as well as between high technology and industrial products, we aggregate them for management review. The following table presents revenue by industry for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automotive\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer products and food and beverage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> High technology and industrial products\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Life sciences and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a constant currency basis, total revenue was $305.0 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $24.1 million, or 9%, increase from $280.9 million for fiscal 2017. When comparing categories within total revenue at constant rates, our results for fiscal 2018 included increases in subscription, license and professional services revenue partially offset by a decrease in maintenance and other revenue. Revenue outside the North America region as a percentage of total revenue was 54% and 53% for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.\nSubscription Revenue. Subscription revenue consists of recurring fees from customers to access our products via the cloud and other subscription offerings. Our cloud offerings typically include access to QAD software, hosting, application support, maintenance support and product updates, if and when available. Included in subscription revenue are one-time set up fees for technical services such as configuration of the database and access to the environment.\nOn a constant currency basis, subscription revenue was $91.9 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $22.4 million, or 32%, increase from $69.5 million for fiscal 2018. Our subscription revenue represented 28% and 23% of our total revenue in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. One of the metrics that management uses to monitor subscription performance is the number of new cloud deals that have been signed in the period. In fiscal 2019 we closed 67 new cloud deals, including 41 new cloud customers and 26 conversions from existing customers who previously purchased on-premises licenses. This compared to fiscal 2018 when we closed 65 new cloud deals, including 37 new cloud customers and 28 conversions from existing customers who previously purchased on-premises licenses. The increase in subscription revenue consists of new customer sites; existing Enterprise Applications users converting from on-premises; and additional users and modules purchased by our existing cloud customers.\nThe following table presents subscription revenue by region for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia Pacific\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Latin America\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total subscription revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents subscription revenue by industry for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automotive\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer products and food and beverage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> High technology and industrial products\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Life sciences and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total subscription revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a constant currency basis, subscription revenue was $69.6 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $17.0 million, or 32%, increase from $52.6 million for fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased in our North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions and remained relatively flat in our Latin America region during fiscal 2018 when compared to the prior year.\nWe track our retention rate of subscription and maintenance by calculating the annualized revenue of customer sites with contracts up for renewal during the period compared to the annualized revenue associated with the customer sites that have canceled during the period. The percentage of revenue not canceled is our retention rate. Conversions to the cloud are not considered cancellations for purposes of this calculation. Our subscription customer retention rate is in excess of 90% in each of the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nLicense Revenue. License revenue is derived from software license fees that customers pay for our core product, QAD Enterprise Applications, and any add-on modules they purchase. Our revenue mix has continued to shift from license to subscription revenue as a result of our business model transition as more new customers subscribe to our cloud based offerings rather than purchase perpetual licenses. While we expect license revenue to decline over time, we do continue to experience quarterly fluctuations.\nOn a constant currency basis, license revenue was $25.6 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $0.3 million, or 1%, decrease from $25.9 million for fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, license revenue decreased in our North America region and increased in our Latin America, Asia Pacific and EMEA regions during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2019, 14 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million. This compared to fiscal 2018 in which 15 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million. The majority of our license revenue has come from additional users and module purchases from our existing customers, which we believe is a result of a strong global manufacturing environment.\nOn a constant currency basis, license revenue was $25.8 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $1.7 million, or 7%, increase from $24.1 million for fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, license revenue increased in our North America and Asia Pacific regions, and decreased in our EMEA and Latin America regions during fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, 15 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million. This compared to fiscal 2017 in which 15 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million.\nMaintenance and Other Revenue. We offer support services 24 hours a day, seven days a week in addition to providing software upgrades, which include additional or improved functionality, when and if available.\nOn a constant currency basis, maintenance and other revenue was $122.9 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $6.0 million, or 5%, decrease from $128.9 million for fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, maintenance and other revenue decreased across all regions during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. The decrease in maintenance and other revenue was primarily due to continued conversions of existing customers' perpetual licenses to cloud subscription, in addition to our historical attrition rates. When customers convert to the cloud they no longer pay for maintenance as those support services are included as a component of the subscription offering. Though we continue to see renewal rates above 90%, conversions from on-premises to cloud have resulted in decreases in maintenance revenue and we expect this trend to continue in the future.\nOn a constant currency basis, maintenance and other revenue was $128.1 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $3.7 million, or 3%, decrease from $131.8 million for fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, maintenance and other revenue decreased in our North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions and increased in our Latin America region during fiscal 2018 when compared to the prior year.\nOver the last three years, our maintenance retention rate has remained in excess of 90%.\nProfessional Services Revenue. Our professional services business includes technical and application consulting in addition to training, implementations, migrations and upgrades related to our solutions. Although our professional services are optional, our customers use these services when planning, implementing or upgrading our solutions whether in the cloud or on-premises. Professional services revenue growth is contingent upon subscription and license revenue growth and customer upgrade cycles, which are influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions.\nOn a constant currency basis, professional services revenue was $92.7 million for fiscal 2019, representing an $11.4 million, or 14%, increase from $81.3 million for fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, professional services revenue increased in our North America, Latin America and EMEA regions and remained relatively flat in our Asia Pacific region during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. The increase in professional services revenue period over period can be attributed to personnel augmentation services we performed for one of our cloud customers, mainly through third-party contractors at low margins. For fiscal 2019, personnel augmentation services revenue was $7.3 million, compared to $1.1 million for fiscal 2018. Augmentation services consists of providing our employees or third party contractors to assist the customer with the implementation tasks the customer needs performed by supplementing their workforce. In addition, fiscal 2019 results reflected a higher amount of revenue per customer and a higher number of engagements compared to the prior year.\nOn a constant currency basis, professional services revenue was $81.5 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $9.0 million, or 12%, increase from $72.5 million for fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, professional services revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2018 when compared to the prior year.

Cost of subscription includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and other personnel expenses of our cloud operations employees; stock-based compensation for those employees; third-party contractor expense, third-party hosting and hardware costs; royalties; professional fees; travel expense; and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs. Cost of license includes license royalties and amortization of capitalized software costs. Cost of maintenance and other includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and other personnel expenses of our support group, stock-based compensation for those employees, travel expense, professional fees and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs.

On a constant currency basis, total cost of revenue was $155.9 million and $149.1 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively and as a percentage of total revenue was 47% for fiscal 2019 and 49% for fiscal 2018. The decrease in total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was due to improved subscription and professional services margins. The non-currency related increase in cost of revenue of $6.8 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher hosting and personnel costs associated with the increase in subscription revenue and higher third-party contractor costs, travel and personnel costs, associated with increased professional services revenue.\nOn a constant currency basis, total cost of revenue was $149.4 million and $132.1 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively and as a percentage of total revenue was 49% for fiscal 2018 and 47% for fiscal 2017. The increase in total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was mainly due to lower professional services margins and the shift of our revenue mix from maintenance to subscription. The non-currency related increase in cost of revenue of $17.3 million, or 13%, in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher hosting and personnel costs associated with the increase in subscription revenue and higher third-party contractor, travel and personnel costs associated with increased professional services revenue.\nCost of Subscription. On a constant currency basis, cost of subscription was $34.1 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $3.6 million, or 12%, increase from $30.5 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related increase in cost of subscription of $3.6 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher hosting costs of $3.1 million and higher salaries and related costs of $0.6 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 30 people. Cost of subscription as a percentage of subscription revenue was 37% and 44% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. We have continued to improve our subscription margins over time due to leveraging of ongoing economies of scale and implementing operational efficiencies. We have experienced and may experience in the future quarterly fluctuations in our subscription margins as we make investments in our data centers and cloud operations to support future growth. Our strategic investments in cloud growth may not match the timing of revenue increases.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of subscription was $30.6 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $3.5 million, or 13%, increase from $27.1 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in cost of subscription of $3.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher hosting costs of $2.5 million, higher salaries and related costs of $0.8 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 9 people and higher third-party contractor costs of $0.4 million. These costs were partially offset by $0.8 million of personnel costs cross charged to our services department to support conversion and upgrade projects. Cost of subscription as a percentage of subscription revenue was 44% and 52% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCost of License. On a constant currency basis, cost of license was $2.7 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $0.2 million, or 7%, decrease from $2.9 million for fiscal 2018. A majority of cost of license was royalty expense, which as a percent of license revenue, remained relatively consistent year over year.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of license was $2.9 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $0.1 million, or 3%, decrease from $3.0 million for fiscal 2017. A majority of cost of license was royalty expense, which as a percent of license revenue, remained relatively consistent year over year.\nCost of Maintenance and Other. On a constant currency basis, cost of maintenance and other was $31.3 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $0.2 million, or 1%, increase from $31.1 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related increase in cost of maintenance and other of $0.2 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to personnel costs. Cost of maintenance and other as a percentage of maintenance and other revenue was 25% and 24% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of maintenance and other was $31.2 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $0.4 million, or 1%, increase from $30.8 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in cost of maintenance and other of $0.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to higher personnel costs of $0.4 million. Cost of maintenance and other as a percentage of maintenance and other revenue was 24% and 23% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCost of Professional Services. On a constant currency basis, cost of professional services was $87.7 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $3.2 million, or 4%, increase from $84.5 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related increase in cost of professional services of $3.2 million was primarily due to higher third-party contractor costs of $1.6 million, higher travel of $1.3 million and higher salaries and related costs of $1.1 million partially offset by lower bonuses of $0.5 million and lower severance of $0.3 million. The increase in salaries and related costs was the result of the addition of 40 services people hired in relation to the acquisition of our Indonesian distributor's assets, partially offset by a reduction of 20 people in our existing business.\nCost of professional services as a percentage of professional services revenue was 95% for fiscal 2019 and 104% for fiscal 2018. We increased our services capacity by adding headcount and partners in fiscal 2018 in order to fulfill additional projects. The investment in hiring and training additional services personnel negatively impacted our professional services margins in fiscal 2018, but as utilization of those additional resources has increased, our professional services margins has improved. Our professional services margins have historically ranged from about breakeven to 10%. We believe we offer competitive rates and view our professional services organization as a department supporting the implementation and deployment of our products which improves the overall customer experience.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of professional services was $84.7 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $13.5 million, or 19%, increase from $71.2 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in cost of professional services of $13.5 million was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs of $4.4 million, as a result of higher headcount of approximately 87 people, higher third-party contractor costs of $3.6 million, higher bonuses of $1.3 million, higher travel of $1.5 million and higher information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.7 million. In addition, cost of professional services included higher personnel costs from other departments of $1.2 million related to employees who worked on services engagements. Cost of professional services as a percentage of professional services revenue was 104% for fiscal 2018 and 98% for fiscal 2017.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change in\n\t\t\tConstant\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change due\n\t\t\tto Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Change\n\t\t\tas Reported\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fluctuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,709 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(130 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,839 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-4 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change in\nConstant\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change due\n\t\t\tto Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Change\n\t\t\tas Reported\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fluctuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,571 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(603 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,174 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-12 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expense includes salaries, benefits, commissions, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel expense and other personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees in addition to costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as trade shows, user group events, lead generation, advertising and various sales and promotional programs. Sales and marketing expense also includes personnel costs of order processing, sales agent fees and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs.\nOn a constant currency basis, sales and marketing expense was $78.2 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $2.7 million, or 4%, increase from $75.5 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related increase in sales and marketing expense of $2.7 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs of $3.4 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 30 people, higher stock compensation of $0.8 million, higher severance of $0.6 million, higher information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.4 million and higher travel of $0.3 million. These higher expenses were offset by lower commissions of $4.5 million, which is partly attributable to the capitalization of commission expense in fiscal 2019 as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard, Topic 606. Commissions in fiscal 2018 was driven by stronger than anticipated new cloud business bookings in the fourth quarter and was expensed as incurred in fiscal 2018 whereas in fiscal 2019 commission expense related to new subscription and maintenance was capitalized and will be amortized over five years.\nOn a constant currency basis, sales and marketing expense was $75.4 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $7.6 million, or 11%, increase from $67.8 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in sales and marketing expense of $7.6 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher commissions of $3.2 million, higher salaries and related costs of $2.1 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 16 people, higher bonuses of $1.6 million and higher travel of $0.5 million. Stronger than anticipated new cloud business closed in the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter resulted in higher bonuses and commissions without the associated revenue, as we recognized these expenses up front, while the revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.\nResearch and Development\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change in\n\t\t\tConstant\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change due\n\t\t\tto Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Change\n\t\t\tas Reported\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fluctuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,265 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(67 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,332 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-13 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change in\n\t\t\tConstant\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change due\n\t\t\tto Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Change\n\t\t\tas Reported\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fluctuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,700 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(374 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,074 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-9 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development is expensed as incurred and consists primarily of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel expense and other personnel costs for research and development employees in addition to professional services, such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors.

These costs were a result of our investment in our Channel Islands project, which included the development of a new platform and user interface.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change in\n\t\t\tConstant\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change due\n\t\t\tto Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Change\n\t\t\tas Reported\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fluctuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and Administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(147 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change in\n\t\t\tConstant\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change due\n\t\t\tto Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Change\n\t\t\tas Reported\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fluctuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and Administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,863 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(41 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,904 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-9 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expense includes salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel expense and other personnel costs related to our finance, human resources, legal and executive personnel, as well as professional fees for accounting and legal services, bad debt expense and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs.\nOn a constant currency basis, general and administrative expense was $35.2 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $0.2 million, or 1%, decrease from $35.4 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related decrease in general and administrative expense of $0.2 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to lower bonuses of $0.8 million and lower stock compensation of $0.4 million partially offset by higher accounting fees of $0.4 million and higher payroll taxes of $0.2 million.\nOn a constant currency basis, general and administrative expense was $35.2 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $2.8 million, or 9%, increase from $32.4 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in general and administrative expense of $2.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher bonuses of $1.0 million, higher stock compensation of $0.8 million and higher legal and accounting fees of $0.8 million.\nAmortization of Intangibles from Acquisitions\nAmortization of intangibles from acquisitions totaled $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.7 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortization expense for fiscal 2019 was due to intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2019.

When comparing fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018, the favorable change is primarily related to higher foreign exchange gains of $2.7 million, as the U.S. dollar strengthened by approximately 10% against the euro, and higher interest income of $1.1 million due to interest rate increases. When comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017, the unfavorable change is primarily related to higher foreign exchange losses of $2.3 million, as the U.S. dollar declined approximately 10% against the euro and Mexican peso, partially offset by higher interest income of $0.9 million due to interest rate increases.\nInterest rate swap valuations and foreign exchange gains and losses are subject to changes which are inherently unpredictable. Our interest rate swap is accounted for using mark-to-market accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap each reporting period are adjusted through earnings, subjecting us to non-cash volatility in our results of operations. The swap fixes the interest rate on our mortgage to 4.31% over the entire term of the mortgage. Although the agreement allows us to prepay the loan and exit the agreement early, we have no intention of doing so. As a result, we will have non-cash adjustments through earnings each reporting period. Over the term of the mortgage, however, the net impact of these mark-to-market adjustments on earnings will be zero.\nIncome Tax Expense\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n\t\t\tCompared\n\t\t\tto Prior Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\nCompared\n\t\t\tto Prior Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,368 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-69 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,419 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-75 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,276 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective tax rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-115 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recorded income tax expense of $1.5 million, $4.9 million and $19.3 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively. QAD's effective tax rate was 12%, -115%, and 504% for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We generated pre-tax income of $11.9 million in fiscal 2019 versus incurring a pre-tax loss of $(4.2) million in fiscal 2018. Income tax expense in fiscal 2018 included an accrual of $2.0 million to estimate a one-time mandatory repatriation tax owed related to the Tax Act. The calculation was further refined during fiscal 2019 and the final amount owed was $0.7 million. As a result, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. In addition, in fiscal 2019 we recorded increased deductions overseas from our equity compensation which lowered our tax expense.\nIn 2018, our effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the provisional effects of the Tax Act, our jurisdictional mix of income and equity compensation windfalls. In fiscal 2018, we recorded an accrual of $2.0 million to estimate a one-time mandatory repatriation tax related to the Tax Act. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was extraordinarily high due to a $16.3 million valuation allowance placed on U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.\nOur foreign earnings are primarily generated from China, India and Mexico. These countries have higher statutory tax rates and effective tax rates than the U.S. However, we benefit from operating in Ireland which has a lower statutory income tax rate and effective tax rate than the U.S.\nFor further information regarding income taxes, see Note 4 Income Taxes\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\u201d defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins, non-GAAP pre-tax income and estimated cash taxes on GAAP earnings each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. We define the non-GAAP measures as follows:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA is GAAP net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA less stock-based compensation expense and the change in the fair value of our interest rate swap.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins - Calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA by total revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Non-GAAP pre-tax income - GAAP income before income taxes not including the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Estimated cash taxes on GAAP earnings - Defined as GAAP total tax expense excluding changes in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nQAD's management uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the business and believes that presenting non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations as well as useful metrics for monitoring our performance and evaluating it against industry peers. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should be used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure in evaluating the company.\nQAD non-GAAP measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nStock-based compensation expense: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP pre-tax income calculations. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense which generally requires cash settlement by QAD, and therefore is not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We also believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our peers.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets: We amortize purchased intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions. We have excluded the effect of amortization of purchased intangible assets, which include purchased technology, customer relationships, trade names and other intangible assets, from our non-GAAP pre-tax income calculation, because doing so makes internal comparisons to our historical operating results more consistent. In addition, we believe excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets provides a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our peers.\nChange in fair value of the interest rate swap: We entered into an interest rate swap to mitigate our exposure to the variability of one-month LIBOR for our floating rate debt related to the mortgage of our headquarters. We have excluded the gain/loss adjustments to record the interest rate swap at fair value from our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP pre-tax income calculations. We believe that these fluctuations are not indicative of our operational costs or meaningful in evaluating comparative period results because we currently have no intention of exiting the debt agreement early; and therefore over the life of the debt the sum of the fair value adjustments will be zero.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins and non-GAAP pre-tax income to the most comparable GAAP measures for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary source of cash is from the sale of subscription, licenses, maintenance and professional services to our customers. Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating expenses which mainly consist of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for facilities, third-party hosting providers, third party contractors and other overhead costs. In addition to operating expenses, we may also use cash for capital expenditures; payment of dividends, taxes on equity award exercises and stock repurchases; and to invest in our growth initiatives, which may include acquisitions of products, technologies and businesses.\nAt January 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and equivalents totaling $139.4 million, short-term investments of $1.2 million and net accounts receivable of $81.6 million. Our cash and equivalents consisted of current bank accounts, registered money market funds and time delineated deposits. Approximately 85% of our cash and equivalents were held in U.S. dollar denominated accounts as of January 31, 2019.\nOur primary commercial banking relationship is with Bank of America and its global affiliates. Our largest cash concentrations are in the United States and Ireland. The percentage of cash and equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries was 74% and 69% as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018, respectively. The majority of our cash and equivalents are held in investment accounts which are predominantly placed in money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury and government securities funds. The remaining cash and equivalents and short-term investments are held in deposit accounts and certificates of deposit.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. We do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings as of the balance sheet date.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries which resulted in $0.7 million of additional U.S. tax and will be paid in equal installments over eight years beginning in fiscal 2019. In spite of the U.S. taxation on these earnings, we intend to permanently reinvest the earnings in our foreign subsidiaries. Should we decide to repatriate these earnings in the future, we would not expect to incur significant additional taxes; however, foreign withholding taxes, currency translation, state taxes and currency control laws must always be considered.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,680 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,258 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,669 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,406 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,691 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,165 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,814 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,668 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(109 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,610 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,351 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTypical factors affecting our cash provided by operating activities include our level of revenue and earnings for the period; the timing and amount of employee related compensation payments, vendor payments and tax payments; and the timing and amount of billings and cash collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flow. Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $19.0 million and $10.4 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was due primarily to an increase in net income of $19.5 million and the positive cash flow effect of changes in accounts receivable of $11.0 million partially offset by the negative cash flow effect of changes in accounts payable and other liabilities of $(17.4) million.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $10.4 million and $18.7 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was due to a decrease in pre-tax income of $8 million. Although our revenue increased 10% year over year, our personnel expenses were significantly higher as a result of hiring 160 additional employees to support the growth in our subscription and services offerings.\nNet cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $4.3 million, $3.7 million and $3.3 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We continue to monitor our capital spending and do not believe we are delaying critical capital expenditures required to run our business. During fiscal 2019, we made two acquisitions. We acquired the assets of one of our Indonesian software distributors and made another acquisition to add functionality to our product suite. The total purchase price of the two acquisitions was $2.7 million and funded entirely with cash on hand.\nNet cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of payments of withholding taxes on settlement of stock-based compensation and payment of dividends. We paid withholding taxes of $8.7 million, $3.4 million and $2.1 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, on vested restricted stock units and exercised stock appreciation rights. We made dividend payments of $5.5 million, $5.4 million and $5.3 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On a regular basis the Board of Directors evaluates our ability to continue to pay dividends as well as the structure of any potential dividend payments.\nWe have historically calculated accounts receivable days' sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d), using the countback, or last-in first-out, method. This method calculates the number of days of billed revenue represented by the accounts receivable balance as of period end. When reviewing the performance of our entities, DSO under the countback method is used by management. It is management's belief that the countback method best reflects the relative health of our accounts receivable as of a given quarter-end or year-end because of the cyclical nature of our billings. Our billing cycle includes high annual maintenance renewal billings at year-end that will not be recognized as earned revenue until future periods.\nDSO under the countback method was relatively consistent at 48 days and 51 days as of January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. DSO using the average method, which is calculated utilizing the accounts receivable balance and earned revenue for the most recent quarter, was 89 days and 93 days as of January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The aging of our accounts receivable remained consistent when compared with the same period last year. We believe our reserve methodology is adequate, our reserves are properly stated as of January 31, 2019 and the quality of our receivables remains good.\nThere have been no material changes in our contractual obligations or commercial commitments outside the ordinary course of business. Cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for capital expenditures, dividend payments and other equity transactions. We may require cash for acquisitions of new businesses, software products or technologies complementary to our business.\nWe believe that our cash on hand and net cash provided by operating activities will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our current and long-term working capital requirements, debt service, dividend payments and other cash needs for at least the next twelve months.\nOur revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. See Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for further discussion.\nSeasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for maintenance and subscription. When renewing maintenance we generally invoice our customers in annual cycles and when renewing subscription we generally invoice our customers quarterly or annually. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal period. The invoice for initial maintenance and subsequent invoices for maintenance renewal may occur in different quarters of the relevant year. This may result in quarterly fluctuations in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings.\nThe sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable, related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below (in thousands):\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

They are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding for QAD which specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology infrastructure costs, hosting services agreements and costs associated with our sales and marketing events.\nWe have omitted unrecognized tax benefits from this table due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of potential issue resolution. Specifically, either (a) the underlying positions have not been fully enough developed under audit to quantify at this time, or (b) the years relating to the issues for certain jurisdictions are not currently under audit. As of January 31, 2019, we had $1.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This is before the netting required by ASU 2013-11 which requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against deferred tax assets for a loss or credit that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax position. For further information regarding the unrecognized tax benefits see Note 4 Income Taxes\u201d within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPurchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time frames. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months.\nWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on the number of licenses delivered or being used in the cloud environment; or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, included in cost of subscription, license and maintenance and other revenue, was $18.6 million, $17.1 million and $16.2 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNote Payable\nEffective May 30, 2012, QAD Ortega Hill, LLC entered into a variable rate credit agreement (the 2012 Mortgage\u201d) with Rabobank, N.A., to refinance a pre-existing mortgage. The 2012 Mortgage has an original principal balance of $16.1 million and bears interest at the one month LIBOR rate plus 2.25%. One month LIBOR was 2.51% at January 31, 2019. The 2012 Mortgage matures in June 2022 and is secured by the Company's headquarters located in Santa Barbara, California. In conjunction with the 2012 Mortgage, QAD Ortega Hill, LLC entered into an interest rate swap with Rabobank, N.A. The swap agreement has an initial notional amount of $16.1 million and a schedule matching that of the underlying loan that synthetically fixes the interest rate on the debt at 4.31% for the entire term of the 2012 Mortgage. The terms of the 2012 Mortgage provide for QAD Ortega Hill, LLC to make net monthly payments of $88,100 consisting of principal and interest and one final payment of $11.7 million. The unpaid balance as of January 31, 2019 was $13.4 million.\nLease Obligations\nWe lease certain office facilities, office equipment and automobiles under operating lease agreements. Although our office lease agreements end on various dates through fiscal year 2028, they typically include termination options at earlier dates. The contractual obligations table reflects future minimum rental payments under non-cancellable operating lease commitments with terms of more than one year. For further discussion of our leased office facilities, see Item 2 entitled Properties\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of January 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe SEC defines critical accounting policies\u201d as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. These policies often require us to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and are subject to change in subsequent periods.\nWe consider the following policies to be critical because of the significance of these items to our operating results and the estimation processes and management judgment involved in each:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Accounts receivable allowances for doubtful accounts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Goodwill and intangible assets - impairment assessments\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Income taxes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures. Historically, estimates described in our critical accounting policies that have required significant judgment and estimation on the part of management have been reasonably accurate.\nRevenue. We offer our software using the same underlying technology via two models: a traditional on-premises licensing model and a cloud-based subscription model. The on-premises model involves the sale or license of software on a perpetual basis to customers who take possession of the software and install and maintain the software on their own hardware. Under the cloud-based subscription delivery model, we provide access to our software on a hosted basis as a service and customers generally do not have the contractual right to take possession of the software.\nWe generate revenue through sales of licenses and maintenance provided to our on-premises customers and through subscriptions of our cloud-based software. We offer professional services to both our on-premises and cloud customers to assist them with the design, testing and implementation of our software.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Determination of the transaction price;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue is presented net of sales, value-added and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities.\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under Topic 606. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer. We identify and track the performance obligations at contract inception so that we can monitor and account for the performance obligations over the life of the contract.\nOur contracts which contain multiple performance obligations generally consist of the initial purchase of subscription or licenses and a professional services engagement. License purchases generally have multiple performance obligations as customers purchase maintenance in addition to the licenses. Our single performance obligation arrangements are typically maintenance renewals, subscription renewals and services engagements.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations where the contracted price differs from the standalone selling price (\"SSP\") for any distinct good or service, we may be required to allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate for the SSP. SSP is assessed annually using a historical analysis of contracts with customers executed in the most recently completed fiscal year to determine the range of selling prices applicable to a distinct good or service.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We rarely license or sell our software products on a stand-alone basis, so we are required to estimate the range of SSPs for each performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable because we do not sell the license, product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In making these judgments, we analyze various factors, including our pricing methodology and consistency, size of the arrangement, length of term, customer demographics and overall market and economic conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for each distinct product or service delivered to customers.\nSubscription\nSubscription revenue is recognized ratably over the initial subscription period committed to by the customer commencing when the cloud environment is made available to the customer. The initial subscription period is typically 12 to 60 months. We generally invoice our customers in advance in quarterly or annual installments and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.\nSoftware Licenses\nTransfer of control for software is considered to have occurred upon electronic delivery of the license key that provides immediate availability of the product to the customer. Our typical payment terms tend to vary by region but our standard payment terms are within 30-90 days of invoice.\nMaintenance\nRevenue from support services and product updates, referred to as maintenance revenue, is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period, which in most instances is one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product updates, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period on a when-and-if available basis. Product support includes Internet access to technical content, as well as Internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Our customers purchase both product support and license updates when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, a majority of customers renew their support services contracts annually and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.\nProfessional Services\nRevenue from professional services is typically comprised of implementation, development, training or other consulting services. Consulting services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed fee basis and can include services ranging from software installation to data conversion and building non-complex interfaces to allow the software to operate in integrated environments. We recognize revenue for time-and-materials arrangements as the services are performed. In fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized as services are performed as measured by costs incurred to date, compared to total estimated costs to complete the services project. Management applies judgment when estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete the services projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Services are generally invoiced upon milestones in the contract or upon consumption of the hourly resources and payments are typically due 30 days after invoice.\nIndirect Sales Channels\nWe execute arrangements through indirect sales channels via sales agents and distributors who are authorized to market our software products to end users. In arrangements with sales agents, QAD contracts directly with the customer and the sales agents are compensated on a commission basis. Distributor arrangements are those in which the resellers are authorized to market and distribute our software products to end users in specified territories and the distributor bears the risk of collection from the end user customer. We recognize revenue from transactions with distributors when the distributor submits a signed agreement and transfer of control has occurred to the distributor, in accordance with the five revenue recognition steps noted above. Revenue from distributor transactions is recorded on a net basis (the amount actually received by us from the distributor). We do not offer rights of return, product rotation or price protection to any of our distributors.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nWe disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers by geography and by the customers' industry within manufacturing, as we believe it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nOur revenue by geography is as follows:\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>141,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,436 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,765 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia Pacific\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,742 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Latin America\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,030 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>333,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>305,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>277,973 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur revenue by industry is as follows:\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automotive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 128,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 96,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer products and food and beverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> High technology and industrial products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Life sciences and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 333,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 305,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 277,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement Judgments\nMore judgments and estimates are required under Topic 606 than were required under Topic 605. Due to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under Topic 606 for our arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances.\nRevenue is recognized over time for our subscription, maintenance and fixed fee professional services that are separate performance obligations. For professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization, specification variances and testing requirement changes.\nIf a group of agreements are entered at or near the same time and so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be combined as one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. We exercise judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether agreements should be accounted for separately or as a single arrangement. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.\nIf a contract includes variable consideration, we exercise judgment in estimating the amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. When estimating variable considerations, we will consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Variable consideration will be estimated and included in the contract price only when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThere are several practical expedients and exemptions allowed under Topic 606 that impact timing of revenue recognition and our disclosures. Below is a list of practical expedients we applied in the adoption and application of Topic 606:\nApplication\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> We do not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected within one year or less from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> We generally expense sales commissions and sales agent fees when incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> We also used the practical expedient to calculate contract acquisition costs based on a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics instead of a contract by contract analysis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed (applies to time-and-material engagements).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nModified Retrospective Transition Adjustments\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> For contract modifications, we reflected the aggregate effect of all modifications that occurred prior to the adoption date when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations for the modified contract at transition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract\nOur incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract consist of sales commissions and sales agent fees which are deferred and amortized ratably over the term of economic benefit which we have determined to be five years. These deferred costs are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the expense. Incremental costs related to renewals are expensed as incurred because the term of economic benefit is one year or less. The current and non-current portions of deferred commissions are included in other current assets and other long-term assets, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCosts to fulfill a contract, which are incurred upon initiation of certain services contracts and are related to initial customer setup, are included in other current assets and long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These costs are amortized over the term of economic benefit which we have determined to be five years.\nRecoverability of these costs is subject to various business risks. Quarterly, we compare the carrying value of these assets with the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by them to determine if there is impairment. If impaired, these assets are reduced to an estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis. No impairment losses were recognized during the twelve months ended January 31, 2019.\nAccounts Receivable Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts is comprised of the allowance for bad debt and the allowance for sales adjustments.\nAllowance for Bad Debt\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. We review the collectability of our accounts receivable each period by analyzing balances based on age and record specific allowances for any balances that we determine may not be fully collectible due to inability of the customers to pay. We also provide for a general reserve based on historical data including analysis of write-offs and other known factors. Provisions to the allowance for bad debt are included as bad debt expense in General and Administrative\u201d expense. Judgment is required in adjusting our receivables to amounts we believe are realizable, especially when a customer is experiencing financial difficulty or is in bankruptcy. Although we use the best information available in making our estimates, we may incur additional bad debt expense in future periods which could have a material effect on earnings in any given quarter should additional allowances for doubtful accounts be necessary. The determination to write-off specific accounts receivable balances is made based on likelihood of collection and past due status. Past due status is based on invoice date and terms specific to each customer.\nAllowance for Sales Adjustments\nWe do not generally provide a contractual right of return; however, in the course of business we have occasionally allowed sales adjustments related to customer dispute resolution. We record a provision against revenue for estimated sales adjustments in the same period the related revenues are recorded or when current information indicates additional amounts are required. These estimates are based on historical experience, specifically identified customers and other known factors. Although we use the best information available in making our estimates, we may incur additional provisions against revenue in future periods which could have a material effect on earnings in any given quarter should additional allowances for sales returns be necessary.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets - Impairment Assessments. When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase consideration is typically allocated to acquired technology and other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships and developed technology. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net of the acquisition-date fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The amounts allocated to acquired technology and other intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date. We amortize the acquired technology and other intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives. The estimation of acquisition-date fair values of intangible assets and their useful lives requires us to make assumptions and judgments, including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business, industry and market trends, projections of future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.\nWe review the carrying value of goodwill using the methodology prescribed in FASB Accounting Standards Codification 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d). We test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment as required under Accounting Standard Update No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment\u201d ( ASU 2011-08\u201d). ASU 2011-08 provides for an optional assessment of qualitative factors of impairment ( optional assessment\u201d) prior to necessitating a two-step quantitative impairment test. Should the optional assessment be utilized for any given fiscal year, qualitative factors to consider include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations; macroeconomic conditions; and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.\nUnder the two-step quantitative impairment test, we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired, or the amount of any impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges.\nManagement evaluates the Company as a single reporting unit for business and operating purposes as almost all of our revenue streams are generated by the same underlying technology whether acquired, purchased or developed. In addition, the majority of our costs are, by their nature, shared costs that are not specifically identifiable to a geography or product line but relate to almost all products. As a result, there is a high degree of interdependency among our revenues and cash flows for levels below the consolidated entity and identifiable cash flows for a reporting unit separate from the consolidated entity are not meaningful.\nFor our annual impairment assessments in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 we did not utilize the optional assessment. An impairment analysis was performed at the enterprise level which compared our market capitalization to our net assets as of the test date, November 30. As our market capitalization substantially exceeded our net assets, there was no indication of goodwill impairment for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Each fiscal year we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate.\nAssumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nIncome Taxes. We are a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rate could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative amount of foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax law, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required; significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions and significant estimates in calculations. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation.\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which sometimes results in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax position requires judgment. For tax related contingencies, we account for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step approach: recognition and measurement. We recognize a tax position when we determine that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those positions that do not meet the recognition threshold, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. For those tax positions that meet the recognition threshold, we measure the tax position as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We record interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities as income tax expense. We have reserves to address tax positions that could be challenged by taxing authorities, even though we believe that the positions taken are appropriate. Our tax reserves are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as events occur that could affect our liability.\nThe carrying value of our deferred tax assets reflects an amount that is more likely than not to be realized with taxable income generated by results of future operations. At January 31, 2019, we had $20.4 million of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions, consisting of $56.1 million of gross deferred tax assets offset by valuation allowances of $34.8 million and uncertain tax positions of $0.9 million. In assessing the likelihood of realizing tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance we consider the weight of all available evidence both positive and negative including expected future taxable income and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible. For the year ended January 31, 2019, management continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased by $1.2 million primarily due to increased foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the tax impact of the adoption of Topic 606.\nStock-Based Compensation. We account for share-based payments ( equity awards\u201d) to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d), which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) based on their fair values as measured at the grant date. The fair value of an equity award is recognized as stock-based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of the equity award. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment and the fair value per share of historical grants of equity awards may not be indicative of the fair value per share for future grants of equity awards.\nFair Value of RSUs\nThe fair value of restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) is determined on the grant date of the award as the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period. As our stock price fluctuates, so does the fair value of our future RSU grants. Judgment is required in determining the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period. We estimate the dividends for purposes of this calculation based on our historical dividend payments per share, which has remained consistent over the last three years.\nFair Value of SARs\nThe fair value of stock-settled stock appreciation rights ( SARs\u201d) is determined on the grant date of the award using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. One of the inputs to the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model is the fair market value on the date of the grant. As our stock price fluctuates, so does the fair value of our future SAR grants. Judgment is required in determining the remaining inputs to the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Furthermore, the values underlying these inputs fluctuate, which impacts the fair value of our future SAR grants. These inputs include the expected life, volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend rate. The following describes our policies with respect to determining these valuation inputs:\nExpected Life - The expected life valuation input includes a computation that is based on historical vested SAR exercises and post-vest expiration patterns and an estimate of the expected life for SARs that were fully vested and outstanding. Furthermore, based on our historical pattern of SAR exercises and post-vest expiration patterns we determined that there are two discernible populations, which include QAD's directors and officers and all other QAD employees. The estimate of the expected life for SARs that were fully vested and outstanding was determined as the midpoint of a range as follows: the low end of the range assumes the fully vested and outstanding SARs are exercised or expire unexercised on the evaluation date and the high end of the range assumes that these SARs are exercised or expire unexercised upon contractual term.\nVolatility - The volatility valuation input is based on the historical volatility of our common stock, which we believe is representative of the expected volatility over the expected life of options and SARs.\nRisk Free Interest Rate- The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the SAR.\nDividend Rate - The dividend rate is based on our historical dividend payments per share. Historically, have we paid quarterly dividends at a rate of $0.072 per share of Class A common stock and $0.060 per share of Class B common stock.\nWe record deferred tax assets for equity awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of those equity awards. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our equity awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, the calculated shortfall would increase our income tax expense. If the tax deduction is more than the deferred tax asset, the calculated windfall would decrease our income tax expense.\nTo the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs or experience fluctuations in the underlying criteria used to determine our equity award valuations, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods.\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- The provided table

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nQAD ( QAD\u201d, the Company\u201d, we\u201d or us\u201d) is a leading provider of flexible, cloud-based enterprise software and services for global manufacturing companies. QAD Enterprise Applications support operational requirements in the areas of financials, customer management, supply chain, manufacturing, service and support, analytics, business process management and integration. QAD's portfolio also includes related solutions for quality management software, supply chain management software, transportation management software and business-to-business interoperability. QAD solutions support customers in the automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology, industrial manufacturing and life sciences industries to streamline processes, improve operational performance, comply with regulatory requirements and meet industry standards.\nWe have four principal sources of revenue:\n \u2022 Subscription of Enterprise Applications through our cloud offering in a Software as a Service ( SaaS\u201d) model as well as other hosted applications; \n \u2022 License purchases of Enterprise Applications; \n \u2022 Maintenance and support, including technical support, training materials, product enhancements and upgrades; and \n \u2022 Professional services, including implementations, technical and application consulting, training, migrations and upgrades. \nWe operate primarily in the following four geographic regions: North America, Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. In fiscal 2019, approximately 48% of our total revenue was generated in North America, 30% in EMEA, 15% in Asia Pacific and 7% in Latin America. The majority of our revenue is generated from global customers who have operations in multiple countries throughout the world. A significant portion of our revenue and expenses are derived from international operations which are primarily conducted in foreign currencies. As a result, changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar have impacted our results of operations and may impact our future results of operations. At January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 1,970 employees worldwide, of which 650 employees were based in North America, 610 employees in EMEA, 600 employees in Asia Pacific and 110 employees in Latin America.\nOur customer base and our target markets are primarily global manufacturing companies; therefore, our results are heavily influenced by the state of the manufacturing economy on a global basis. As a result, our management team monitors several economic indicators, with particular attention to the Global and Country Purchasing Managers' Indexes ( PMI\u201d). The PMI is a survey conducted on a monthly basis by polling businesses that represent the makeup of respective sectors. Since most of our customers are manufacturers, our revenue has historically correlated with fluctuations in the manufacturing PMI. Global macro-economic trends and manufacturing spending are important barometers for our business, and the health of the U.S., Western European and Asian economies have a meaningful impact on our financial results.\nWe are transitioning our business model from selling perpetual licenses to providing access to our software on a subscription basis as part of our cloud offering. During fiscal 2019, we closed most of our new customer deals in the cloud. In addition, we converted many of our existing customers from on-premises licenses to our cloud based solution. Recurring revenue, which we define as subscription revenue plus maintenance revenue, accounted for 65% of total revenue for fiscal 2019. By reducing our customers' up-front costs and providing continuous application and infrastructure support, we expect our cloud business model will be more attractive than perpetual licenses. We expect recurring revenue to remain a majority of total revenue as our subscription revenue continues to grow.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe operate in several geographical regions as described in Note 12 Business Segment Information\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In order to present our results of operations without the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we provide certain financial information on a constant currency basis\u201d, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented in the following tables. In order to calculate our constant currency results, we apply the current foreign currency exchange rates to the prior period results.\nRevenue\n\n\nTotal Revenue. On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $333.0 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $27.5 million, or 9%, increase from $305.5 million for fiscal 2018. When comparing categories within total revenue at constant rates, our results for fiscal 2019 included increases in subscription and professional services revenue partially offset by a decrease in license and maintenance and other revenue. In fiscal 2019, one customer accounted for 10% of total revenue and no other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. Revenue outside the North America region as a percentage of total revenue was 52% and 54% for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. Our products are sold to manufacturing companies that operate mainly in the following six industries: automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology, industrial products and life sciences. Given the similarities between consumer products and food and beverage as well as between high technology and industrial products, we aggregate them for management review. The following table presents revenue by industry for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\nOn a constant currency basis, total revenue was $305.0 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $24.1 million, or 9%, increase from $280.9 million for fiscal 2017. When comparing categories within total revenue at constant rates, our results for fiscal 2018 included increases in subscription, license and professional services revenue partially offset by a decrease in maintenance and other revenue. Revenue outside the North America region as a percentage of total revenue was 54% and 53% for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.\nSubscription Revenue. Subscription revenue consists of recurring fees from customers to access our products via the cloud and other subscription offerings. Our cloud offerings typically include access to QAD software, hosting, application support, maintenance support and product updates, if and when available. Included in subscription revenue are one-time set up fees for technical services such as configuration of the database and access to the environment.\nOn a constant currency basis, subscription revenue was $91.9 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $22.4 million, or 32%, increase from $69.5 million for fiscal 2018. Our subscription revenue represented 28% and 23% of our total revenue in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. One of the metrics that management uses to monitor subscription performance is the number of new cloud deals that have been signed in the period. In fiscal 2019 we closed 67 new cloud deals, including 41 new cloud customers and 26 conversions from existing customers who previously purchased on-premises licenses. This compared to fiscal 2018 when we closed 65 new cloud deals, including 37 new cloud customers and 28 conversions from existing customers who previously purchased on-premises licenses. The increase in subscription revenue consists of new customer sites; existing Enterprise Applications users converting from on-premises; and additional users and modules purchased by our existing cloud customers.\nThe following table presents subscription revenue by region for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\nThe following table presents subscription revenue by industry for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\nOn a constant currency basis, subscription revenue was $69.6 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $17.0 million, or 32%, increase from $52.6 million for fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased in our North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions and remained relatively flat in our Latin America region during fiscal 2018 when compared to the prior year.\nWe track our retention rate of subscription and maintenance by calculating the annualized revenue of customer sites with contracts up for renewal during the period compared to the annualized revenue associated with the customer sites that have canceled during the period. The percentage of revenue not canceled is our retention rate. Conversions to the cloud are not considered cancellations for purposes of this calculation. Our subscription customer retention rate is in excess of 90% in each of the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nLicense Revenue. License revenue is derived from software license fees that customers pay for our core product, QAD Enterprise Applications, and any add-on modules they purchase. Our revenue mix has continued to shift from license to subscription revenue as a result of our business model transition as more new customers subscribe to our cloud based offerings rather than purchase perpetual licenses. While we expect license revenue to decline over time, we do continue to experience quarterly fluctuations.\nOn a constant currency basis, license revenue was $25.6 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $0.3 million, or 1%, decrease from $25.9 million for fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, license revenue decreased in our North America region and increased in our Latin America, Asia Pacific and EMEA regions during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2019, 14 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million. This compared to fiscal 2018 in which 15 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million. The majority of our license revenue has come from additional users and module purchases from our existing customers, which we believe is a result of a strong global manufacturing environment.\nOn a constant currency basis, license revenue was $25.8 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $1.7 million, or 7%, increase from $24.1 million for fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, license revenue increased in our North America and Asia Pacific regions, and decreased in our EMEA and Latin America regions during fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, 15 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million. This compared to fiscal 2017 in which 15 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million.\nMaintenance and Other Revenue. We offer support services 24 hours a day, seven days a week in addition to providing software upgrades, which include additional or improved functionality, when and if available.\nOn a constant currency basis, maintenance and other revenue was $122.9 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $6.0 million, or 5%, decrease from $128.9 million for fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, maintenance and other revenue decreased across all regions during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. The decrease in maintenance and other revenue was primarily due to continued conversions of existing customers' perpetual licenses to cloud subscription, in addition to our historical attrition rates. When customers convert to the cloud they no longer pay for maintenance as those support services are included as a component of the subscription offering. Though we continue to see renewal rates above 90%, conversions from on-premises to cloud have resulted in decreases in maintenance revenue and we expect this trend to continue in the future.\nOn a constant currency basis, maintenance and other revenue was $128.1 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $3.7 million, or 3%, decrease from $131.8 million for fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, maintenance and other revenue decreased in our North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions and increased in our Latin America region during fiscal 2018 when compared to the prior year.\nOver the last three years, our maintenance retention rate has remained in excess of 90%.\nProfessional Services Revenue. Our professional services business includes technical and application consulting in addition to training, implementations, migrations and upgrades related to our solutions. Although our professional services are optional, our customers use these services when planning, implementing or upgrading our solutions whether in the cloud or on-premises. Professional services revenue growth is contingent upon subscription and license revenue growth and customer upgrade cycles, which are influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions.\nOn a constant currency basis, professional services revenue was $92.7 million for fiscal 2019, representing an $11.4 million, or 14%, increase from $81.3 million for fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, professional services revenue increased in our North America, Latin America and EMEA regions and remained relatively flat in our Asia Pacific region during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. The increase in professional services revenue period over period can be attributed to personnel augmentation services we performed for one of our cloud customers, mainly through third-party contractors at low margins. For fiscal 2019, personnel augmentation services revenue was $7.3 million, compared to $1.1 million for fiscal 2018. Augmentation services consists of providing our employees or third party contractors to assist the customer with the implementation tasks the customer needs performed by supplementing their workforce. In addition, fiscal 2019 results reflected a higher amount of revenue per customer and a higher number of engagements compared to the prior year.\nOn a constant currency basis, professional services revenue was $81.5 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $9.0 million, or 12%, increase from $72.5 million for fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, professional services revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2018 when compared to the prior year. The increase in professional services revenue period over period can be attributed to a higher amount of professional services revenue per customer.\nTotal Cost of Revenue\n\n\nTotal cost of revenue consists of cost of subscription, cost of license, cost of maintenance and other and cost of professional services. Cost of subscription includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and other personnel expenses of our cloud operations employees; stock-based compensation for those employees; third-party contractor expense, third-party hosting and hardware costs; royalties; professional fees; travel expense; and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs. Cost of license includes license royalties and amortization of capitalized software costs. Cost of maintenance and other includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and other personnel expenses of our support group, stock-based compensation for those employees, travel expense, professional fees and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs. Cost of professional services includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and other personnel expenses of our services employees, stock-based compensation for those employees, third-party contractor expense, travel expense and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs.\nTotal Cost of Revenue. On a constant currency basis, total cost of revenue was $155.9 million and $149.1 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively and as a percentage of total revenue was 47% for fiscal 2019 and 49% for fiscal 2018. The decrease in total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was due to improved subscription and professional services margins. The non-currency related increase in cost of revenue of $6.8 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher hosting and personnel costs associated with the increase in subscription revenue and higher third-party contractor costs, travel and personnel costs, associated with increased professional services revenue.\nOn a constant currency basis, total cost of revenue was $149.4 million and $132.1 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively and as a percentage of total revenue was 49% for fiscal 2018 and 47% for fiscal 2017. The increase in total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was mainly due to lower professional services margins and the shift of our revenue mix from maintenance to subscription. The non-currency related increase in cost of revenue of $17.3 million, or 13%, in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher hosting and personnel costs associated with the increase in subscription revenue and higher third-party contractor, travel and personnel costs associated with increased professional services revenue.\nCost of Subscription. On a constant currency basis, cost of subscription was $34.1 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $3.6 million, or 12%, increase from $30.5 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related increase in cost of subscription of $3.6 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher hosting costs of $3.1 million and higher salaries and related costs of $0.6 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 30 people. Cost of subscription as a percentage of subscription revenue was 37% and 44% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. We have continued to improve our subscription margins over time due to leveraging of ongoing economies of scale and implementing operational efficiencies. We have experienced and may experience in the future quarterly fluctuations in our subscription margins as we make investments in our data centers and cloud operations to support future growth. Our strategic investments in cloud growth may not match the timing of revenue increases.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of subscription was $30.6 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $3.5 million, or 13%, increase from $27.1 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in cost of subscription of $3.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher hosting costs of $2.5 million, higher salaries and related costs of $0.8 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 9 people and higher third-party contractor costs of $0.4 million. These costs were partially offset by $0.8 million of personnel costs cross charged to our services department to support conversion and upgrade projects. Cost of subscription as a percentage of subscription revenue was 44% and 52% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCost of License. On a constant currency basis, cost of license was $2.7 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $0.2 million, or 7%, decrease from $2.9 million for fiscal 2018. A majority of cost of license was royalty expense, which as a percent of license revenue, remained relatively consistent year over year.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of license was $2.9 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $0.1 million, or 3%, decrease from $3.0 million for fiscal 2017. A majority of cost of license was royalty expense, which as a percent of license revenue, remained relatively consistent year over year.\nCost of Maintenance and Other. On a constant currency basis, cost of maintenance and other was $31.3 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $0.2 million, or 1%, increase from $31.1 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related increase in cost of maintenance and other of $0.2 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to personnel costs. Cost of maintenance and other as a percentage of maintenance and other revenue was 25% and 24% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of maintenance and other was $31.2 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $0.4 million, or 1%, increase from $30.8 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in cost of maintenance and other of $0.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to higher personnel costs of $0.4 million. Cost of maintenance and other as a percentage of maintenance and other revenue was 24% and 23% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCost of Professional Services. On a constant currency basis, cost of professional services was $87.7 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $3.2 million, or 4%, increase from $84.5 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related increase in cost of professional services of $3.2 million was primarily due to higher third-party contractor costs of $1.6 million, higher travel of $1.3 million and higher salaries and related costs of $1.1 million partially offset by lower bonuses of $0.5 million and lower severance of $0.3 million. The increase in salaries and related costs was the result of the addition of 40 services people hired in relation to the acquisition of our Indonesian distributor's assets, partially offset by a reduction of 20 people in our existing business.\nCost of professional services as a percentage of professional services revenue was 95% for fiscal 2019 and 104% for fiscal 2018. We increased our services capacity by adding headcount and partners in fiscal 2018 in order to fulfill additional projects. The investment in hiring and training additional services personnel negatively impacted our professional services margins in fiscal 2018, but as utilization of those additional resources has increased, our professional services margins has improved. Our professional services margins have historically ranged from about breakeven to 10%. We believe we offer competitive rates and view our professional services organization as a department supporting the implementation and deployment of our products which improves the overall customer experience.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of professional services was $84.7 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $13.5 million, or 19%, increase from $71.2 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in cost of professional services of $13.5 million was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs of $4.4 million, as a result of higher headcount of approximately 87 people, higher third-party contractor costs of $3.6 million, higher bonuses of $1.3 million, higher travel of $1.5 million and higher information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.7 million. In addition, cost of professional services included higher personnel costs from other departments of $1.2 million related to employees who worked on services engagements. Cost of professional services as a percentage of professional services revenue was 104% for fiscal 2018 and 98% for fiscal 2017.\nSales and Marketing\n\n\nSales and marketing expense includes salaries, benefits, commissions, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel expense and other personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees in addition to costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as trade shows, user group events, lead generation, advertising and various sales and promotional programs. Sales and marketing expense also includes personnel costs of order processing, sales agent fees and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs.\nOn a constant currency basis, sales and marketing expense was $78.2 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $2.7 million, or 4%, increase from $75.5 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related increase in sales and marketing expense of $2.7 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs of $3.4 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 30 people, higher stock compensation of $0.8 million, higher severance of $0.6 million, higher information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.4 million and higher travel of $0.3 million. These higher expenses were offset by lower commissions of $4.5 million, which is partly attributable to the capitalization of commission expense in fiscal 2019 as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard, Topic 606. Commissions in fiscal 2018 was driven by stronger than anticipated new cloud business bookings in the fourth quarter and was expensed as incurred in fiscal 2018 whereas in fiscal 2019 commission expense related to new subscription and maintenance was capitalized and will be amortized over five years.\nOn a constant currency basis, sales and marketing expense was $75.4 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $7.6 million, or 11%, increase from $67.8 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in sales and marketing expense of $7.6 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher commissions of $3.2 million, higher salaries and related costs of $2.1 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 16 people, higher bonuses of $1.6 million and higher travel of $0.5 million. Stronger than anticipated new cloud business closed in the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter resulted in higher bonuses and commissions without the associated revenue, as we recognized these expenses up front, while the revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.\nResearch and Development\n\n\nResearch and development is expensed as incurred and consists primarily of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel expense and other personnel costs for research and development employees in addition to professional services, such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors. Research and development expense includes an allocation of information technology and facilities costs, and is reduced by capitalized localization and translation costs.\nOn a constant currency basis, research and development expense was $54.0 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $6.3 million, or 13%, increase from $47.7 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related increase in research and development expense of $6.3 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher personnel costs of $2.7 million, due in part to higher headcount of approximately 12 people, higher contractor costs of $2.1 million, higher information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.4 million and higher stock compensation of $0.4 million. We continue to invest in our new platform and user interface in addition to developing other advanced technologies such as our automated solutions product.\nOn a constant currency basis, research and development expense was $47.7 million fiscal 2018, representing a $3.7 million, or 8%, increase from $44.0 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in research and development expense of $3.7 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs of $2.2 million, as a result of higher headcount of approximately 35 people, higher bonuses of $0.9 million and higher contractor costs of $0.6 million. These costs were a result of our investment in our Channel Islands project, which included the development of a new platform and user interface.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\n\nGeneral and administrative expense includes salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel expense and other personnel costs related to our finance, human resources, legal and executive personnel, as well as professional fees for accounting and legal services, bad debt expense and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs.\nOn a constant currency basis, general and administrative expense was $35.2 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $0.2 million, or 1%, decrease from $35.4 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related decrease in general and administrative expense of $0.2 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to lower bonuses of $0.8 million and lower stock compensation of $0.4 million partially offset by higher accounting fees of $0.4 million and higher payroll taxes of $0.2 million.\nOn a constant currency basis, general and administrative expense was $35.2 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $2.8 million, or 9%, increase from $32.4 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in general and administrative expense of $2.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher bonuses of $1.0 million, higher stock compensation of $0.8 million and higher legal and accounting fees of $0.8 million.\nAmortization of Intangibles from Acquisitions\nAmortization of intangibles from acquisitions totaled $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.7 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortization expense for fiscal 2019 was due to intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2019. Amortization expense for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was due to intangible assets acquired from our fiscal 2013 acquisitions of DynaSys and CEBOS.\nTotal Other (Income) Expense\n\nTotal other (income) expense, net was $(2.3) million, $1.1 million and $(0.5) million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. When comparing fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018, the favorable change is primarily related to higher foreign exchange gains of $2.7 million, as the U.S. dollar strengthened by approximately 10% against the euro, and higher interest income of $1.1 million due to interest rate increases. When comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017, the unfavorable change is primarily related to higher foreign exchange losses of $2.3 million, as the U.S. dollar declined approximately 10% against the euro and Mexican peso, partially offset by higher interest income of $0.9 million due to interest rate increases.\nInterest rate swap valuations and foreign exchange gains and losses are subject to changes which are inherently unpredictable. Our interest rate swap is accounted for using mark-to-market accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap each reporting period are adjusted through earnings, subjecting us to non-cash volatility in our results of operations. The swap fixes the interest rate on our mortgage to 4.31% over the entire term of the mortgage. Although the agreement allows us to prepay the loan and exit the agreement early, we have no intention of doing so. As a result, we will have non-cash adjustments through earnings each reporting period. Over the term of the mortgage, however, the net impact of these mark-to-market adjustments on earnings will be zero.\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nWe recorded income tax expense of $1.5 million, $4.9 million and $19.3 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively. QAD's effective tax rate was 12%, -115%, and 504% for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We generated pre-tax income of $11.9 million in fiscal 2019 versus incurring a pre-tax loss of $(4.2) million in fiscal 2018. Income tax expense in fiscal 2018 included an accrual of $2.0 million to estimate a one-time mandatory repatriation tax owed related to the Tax Act. The calculation was further refined during fiscal 2019 and the final amount owed was $0.7 million. As a result, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. In addition, in fiscal 2019 we recorded increased deductions overseas from our equity compensation which lowered our tax expense.\nIn 2018, our effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the provisional effects of the Tax Act, our jurisdictional mix of income and equity compensation windfalls. In fiscal 2018, we recorded an accrual of $2.0 million to estimate a one-time mandatory repatriation tax related to the Tax Act. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was extraordinarily high due to a $16.3 million valuation allowance placed on U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.\nOur foreign earnings are primarily generated from China, India and Mexico. These countries have higher statutory tax rates and effective tax rates than the U.S. However, we benefit from operating in Ireland which has a lower statutory income tax rate and effective tax rate than the U.S.\nFor further information regarding income taxes, see Note 4 Income Taxes\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\u201d defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins, non-GAAP pre-tax income and estimated cash taxes on GAAP earnings each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. We define the non-GAAP measures as follows:\n \u25cf Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA is GAAP net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA less stock-based compensation expense and the change in the fair value of our interest rate swap. \n \u25cf Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins - Calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. \n \u25cf Non-GAAP pre-tax income - GAAP income before income taxes not including the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap. \n \u25cf Estimated cash taxes on GAAP earnings - Defined as GAAP total tax expense excluding changes in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits. \nQAD's management uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the business and believes that presenting non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations as well as useful metrics for monitoring our performance and evaluating it against industry peers. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should be used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure in evaluating the company.\nQAD non-GAAP measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nStock-based compensation expense: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP pre-tax income calculations. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense which generally requires cash settlement by QAD, and therefore is not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We also believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our peers.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets: We amortize purchased intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions. We have excluded the effect of amortization of purchased intangible assets, which include purchased technology, customer relationships, trade names and other intangible assets, from our non-GAAP pre-tax income calculation, because doing so makes internal comparisons to our historical operating results more consistent.

QAD Enterprise Applications support operational requirements in the areas of financials, customer management, supply chain, manufacturing, service and support, analytics, business process management and integration. QAD's portfolio also includes related solutions for quality management software, supply chain management software, transportation management software and business-to-business interoperability. QAD solutions support customers in the automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology, industrial manufacturing and life sciences industries to streamline processes, improve operational performance, comply with regulatory requirements and meet industry standards.\nWe have four principal sources of revenue:\n \u2022 Subscription of Enterprise Applications through our cloud offering in a Software as a Service ( SaaS\u201d) model as well as other hosted applications; \n \u2022 License purchases of Enterprise Applications; \n \u2022 Maintenance and support, including technical support, training materials, product enhancements and upgrades; and \n \u2022 Professional services, including implementations, technical and application consulting, training, migrations and upgrades. \nWe operate primarily in the following four geographic regions: North America, Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. In fiscal 2019, approximately 48% of our total revenue was generated in North America, 30% in EMEA, 15% in Asia Pacific and 7% in Latin America. The majority of our revenue is generated from global customers who have operations in multiple countries throughout the world. A significant portion of our revenue and expenses are derived from international operations which are primarily conducted in foreign currencies. As a result, changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar have impacted our results of operations and may impact our future results of operations. At January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 1,970 employees worldwide, of which 650 employees were based in North America, 610 employees in EMEA, 600 employees in Asia Pacific and 110 employees in Latin America.\nOur customer base and our target markets are primarily global manufacturing companies; therefore, our results are heavily influenced by the state of the manufacturing economy on a global basis. As a result, our management team monitors several economic indicators, with particular attention to the Global and Country Purchasing Managers' Indexes ( PMI\u201d). The PMI is a survey conducted on a monthly basis by polling businesses that represent the makeup of respective sectors. Since most of our customers are manufacturers, our revenue has historically correlated with fluctuations in the manufacturing PMI. Global macro-economic trends and manufacturing spending are important barometers for our business, and the health of the U.S., Western European and Asian economies have a meaningful impact on our financial results.\nWe are transitioning our business model from selling perpetual licenses to providing access to our software on a subscription basis as part of our cloud offering. During fiscal 2019, we closed most of our new customer deals in the cloud. In addition, we converted many of our existing customers from on-premises licenses to our cloud based solution. Recurring revenue, which we define as subscription revenue plus maintenance revenue, accounted for 65% of total revenue for fiscal 2019. By reducing our customers' up-front costs and providing continuous application and infrastructure support, we expect our cloud business model will be more attractive than perpetual licenses. We expect recurring revenue to remain a majority of total revenue as our subscription revenue continues to grow.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe operate in several geographical regions as described in Note 12 Business Segment Information\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In order to present our results of operations without the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we provide certain financial information on a constant currency basis\u201d, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented in the following tables. In order to calculate our constant currency results, we apply the current foreign currency exchange rates to the prior period results.\nRevenue\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year

On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $333.0 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $27.5 million, or 9%, increase from $305.5 million for fiscal 2018. When comparing categories within total revenue at constant rates, our results for fiscal 2019 included increases in subscription and professional services revenue partially offset by a decrease in license and maintenance and other revenue. In fiscal 2019, one customer accounted for 10% of total revenue and no other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. Revenue outside the North America region as a percentage of total revenue was 52% and 54% for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. Our products are sold to manufacturing companies that operate mainly in the following six industries: automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology, industrial products and life sciences. Given the similarities between consumer products and food and beverage as well as between high technology and industrial products, we aggregate them for management review. The following table presents revenue by industry for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automotive\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer products and food and beverage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> High technology and industrial products\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Life sciences and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a constant currency basis, total revenue was $305.0 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $24.1 million, or 9%, increase from $280.9 million for fiscal 2017. When comparing categories within total revenue at constant rates, our results for fiscal 2018 included increases in subscription, license and professional services revenue partially offset by a decrease in maintenance and other revenue. Revenue outside the North America region as a percentage of total revenue was 54% and 53% for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.\nSubscription Revenue. Subscription revenue consists of recurring fees from customers to access our products via the cloud and other subscription offerings. Our cloud offerings typically include access to QAD software, hosting, application support, maintenance support and product updates, if and when available. Included in subscription revenue are one-time set up fees for technical services such as configuration of the database and access to the environment.\nOn a constant currency basis, subscription revenue was $91.9 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $22.4 million, or 32%, increase from $69.5 million for fiscal 2018. Our subscription revenue represented 28% and 23% of our total revenue in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. One of the metrics that management uses to monitor subscription performance is the number of new cloud deals that have been signed in the period. In fiscal 2019 we closed 67 new cloud deals, including 41 new cloud customers and 26 conversions from existing customers who previously purchased on-premises licenses. This compared to fiscal 2018 when we closed 65 new cloud deals, including 37 new cloud customers and 28 conversions from existing customers who previously purchased on-premises licenses. The increase in subscription revenue consists of new customer sites; existing Enterprise Applications users converting from on-premises; and additional users and modules purchased by our existing cloud customers.\nThe following table presents subscription revenue by region for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia Pacific\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Latin America\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total subscription revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents subscription revenue by industry for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automotive\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer products and food and beverage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> High technology and industrial products\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Life sciences and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total subscription revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a constant currency basis, subscription revenue was $69.6 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $17.0 million, or 32%, increase from $52.6 million for fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased in our North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions and remained relatively flat in our Latin America region during fiscal 2018 when compared to the prior year.\nWe track our retention rate of subscription and maintenance by calculating the annualized revenue of customer sites with contracts up for renewal during the period compared to the annualized revenue associated with the customer sites that have canceled during the period. The percentage of revenue not canceled is our retention rate. Conversions to the cloud are not considered cancellations for purposes of this calculation. Our subscription customer retention rate is in excess of 90% in each of the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nLicense Revenue. License revenue is derived from software license fees that customers pay for our core product, QAD Enterprise Applications, and any add-on modules they purchase. Our revenue mix has continued to shift from license to subscription revenue as a result of our business model transition as more new customers subscribe to our cloud based offerings rather than purchase perpetual licenses. While we expect license revenue to decline over time, we do continue to experience quarterly fluctuations.\nOn a constant currency basis, license revenue was $25.6 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $0.3 million, or 1%, decrease from $25.9 million for fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, license revenue decreased in our North America region and increased in our Latin America, Asia Pacific and EMEA regions during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2019, 14 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million. This compared to fiscal 2018 in which 15 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million. The majority of our license revenue has come from additional users and module purchases from our existing customers, which we believe is a result of a strong global manufacturing environment.\nOn a constant currency basis, license revenue was $25.8 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $1.7 million, or 7%, increase from $24.1 million for fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, license revenue increased in our North America and Asia Pacific regions, and decreased in our EMEA and Latin America regions during fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, 15 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million. This compared to fiscal 2017 in which 15 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million.\nMaintenance and Other Revenue. We offer support services 24 hours a day, seven days a week in addition to providing software upgrades, which include additional or improved functionality, when and if available.\nOn a constant currency basis, maintenance and other revenue was $122.9 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $6.0 million, or 5%, decrease from $128.9 million for fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, maintenance and other revenue decreased across all regions during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. The decrease in maintenance and other revenue was primarily due to continued conversions of existing customers' perpetual licenses to cloud subscription, in addition to our historical attrition rates. When customers convert to the cloud they no longer pay for maintenance as those support services are included as a component of the subscription offering. Though we continue to see renewal rates above 90%, conversions from on-premises to cloud have resulted in decreases in maintenance revenue and we expect this trend to continue in the future.\nOn a constant currency basis, maintenance and other revenue was $128.1 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $3.7 million, or 3%, decrease from $131.8 million for fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, maintenance and other revenue decreased in our North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions and increased in our Latin America region during fiscal 2018 when compared to the prior year.\nOver the last three years, our maintenance retention rate has remained in excess of 90%.\nProfessional Services Revenue. Our professional services business includes technical and application consulting in addition to training, implementations, migrations and upgrades related to our solutions. Although our professional services are optional, our customers use these services when planning, implementing or upgrading our solutions whether in the cloud or on-premises. Professional services revenue growth is contingent upon subscription and license revenue growth and customer upgrade cycles, which are influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions.\nOn a constant currency basis, professional services revenue was $92.7 million for fiscal 2019, representing an $11.4 million, or 14%, increase from $81.3 million for fiscal 2018. On a constant currency basis, professional services revenue increased in our North America, Latin America and EMEA regions and remained relatively flat in our Asia Pacific region during fiscal 2019 when compared to the prior year. The increase in professional services revenue period over period can be attributed to personnel augmentation services we performed for one of our cloud customers, mainly through third-party contractors at low margins. For fiscal 2019, personnel augmentation services revenue was $7.3 million, compared to $1.1 million for fiscal 2018. Augmentation services consists of providing our employees or third party contractors to assist the customer with the implementation tasks the customer needs performed by supplementing their workforce. In addition, fiscal 2019 results reflected a higher amount of revenue per customer and a higher number of engagements compared to the prior year.\nOn a constant currency basis, professional services revenue was $81.5 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $9.0 million, or 12%, increase from $72.5 million for fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, professional services revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2018 when compared to the prior year. The increase in professional services revenue period over period can be attributed to a higher amount of professional services revenue per customer.\nTotal Cost of Revenue\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>

Cost of subscription includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and other personnel expenses of our cloud operations employees; stock-based compensation for those employees; third-party contractor expense, third-party hosting and hardware costs; royalties; professional fees; travel expense; and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs. Cost of license includes license royalties and amortization of capitalized software costs. Cost of maintenance and other includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and other personnel expenses of our support group, stock-based compensation for those employees, travel expense, professional fees and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs. Cost of professional services includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and other personnel expenses of our services employees, stock-based compensation for those employees, third-party contractor expense, travel expense and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs.\nTotal Cost of Revenue. On a constant currency basis, total cost of revenue was $155.9 million and $149.1 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively and as a percentage of total revenue was 47% for fiscal 2019 and 49% for fiscal 2018. The decrease in total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was due to improved subscription and professional services margins. The non-currency related increase in cost of revenue of $6.8 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher hosting and personnel costs associated with the increase in subscription revenue and higher third-party contractor costs, travel and personnel costs, associated with increased professional services revenue.\nOn a constant currency basis, total cost of revenue was $149.4 million and $132.1 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively and as a percentage of total revenue was 49% for fiscal 2018 and 47% for fiscal 2017. The increase in total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was mainly due to lower professional services margins and the shift of our revenue mix from maintenance to subscription. The non-currency related increase in cost of revenue of $17.3 million, or 13%, in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher hosting and personnel costs associated with the increase in subscription revenue and higher third-party contractor, travel and personnel costs associated with increased professional services revenue.\nCost of Subscription. On a constant currency basis, cost of subscription was $34.1 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $3.6 million, or 12%, increase from $30.5 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related increase in cost of subscription of $3.6 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher hosting costs of $3.1 million and higher salaries and related costs of $0.6 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 30 people. Cost of subscription as a percentage of subscription revenue was 37% and 44% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. We have continued to improve our subscription margins over time due to leveraging of ongoing economies of scale and implementing operational efficiencies. We have experienced and may experience in the future quarterly fluctuations in our subscription margins as we make investments in our data centers and cloud operations to support future growth. Our strategic investments in cloud growth may not match the timing of revenue increases.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of subscription was $30.6 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $3.5 million, or 13%, increase from $27.1 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in cost of subscription of $3.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher hosting costs of $2.5 million, higher salaries and related costs of $0.8 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 9 people and higher third-party contractor costs of $0.4 million. These costs were partially offset by $0.8 million of personnel costs cross charged to our services department to support conversion and upgrade projects. Cost of subscription as a percentage of subscription revenue was 44% and 52% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCost of License. On a constant currency basis, cost of license was $2.7 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $0.2 million, or 7%, decrease from $2.9 million for fiscal 2018. A majority of cost of license was royalty expense, which as a percent of license revenue, remained relatively consistent year over year.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of license was $2.9 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $0.1 million, or 3%, decrease from $3.0 million for fiscal 2017. A majority of cost of license was royalty expense, which as a percent of license revenue, remained relatively consistent year over year.\nCost of Maintenance and Other. On a constant currency basis, cost of maintenance and other was $31.3 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $0.2 million, or 1%, increase from $31.1 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related increase in cost of maintenance and other of $0.2 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to personnel costs. Cost of maintenance and other as a percentage of maintenance and other revenue was 25% and 24% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of maintenance and other was $31.2 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $0.4 million, or 1%, increase from $30.8 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in cost of maintenance and other of $0.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to higher personnel costs of $0.4 million. Cost of maintenance and other as a percentage of maintenance and other revenue was 24% and 23% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCost of Professional Services. On a constant currency basis, cost of professional services was $87.7 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $3.2 million, or 4%, increase from $84.5 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related increase in cost of professional services of $3.2 million was primarily due to higher third-party contractor costs of $1.6 million, higher travel of $1.3 million and higher salaries and related costs of $1.1 million partially offset by lower bonuses of $0.5 million and lower severance of $0.3 million. The increase in salaries and related costs was the result of the addition of 40 services people hired in relation to the acquisition of our Indonesian distributor's assets, partially offset by a reduction of 20 people in our existing business.\nCost of professional services as a percentage of professional services revenue was 95% for fiscal 2019 and 104% for fiscal 2018. We increased our services capacity by adding headcount and partners in fiscal 2018 in order to fulfill additional projects. The investment in hiring and training additional services personnel negatively impacted our professional services margins in fiscal 2018, but as utilization of those additional resources has increased, our professional services margins has improved. Our professional services margins have historically ranged from about breakeven to 10%. We believe we offer competitive rates and view our professional services organization as a department supporting the implementation and deployment of our products which improves the overall customer experience.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of professional services was $84.7 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $13.5 million, or 19%, increase from $71.2 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in cost of professional services of $13.5 million was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs of $4.4 million, as a result of higher headcount of approximately 87 people, higher third-party contractor costs of $3.6 million, higher bonuses of $1.3 million, higher travel of $1.5 million and higher information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.7 million. In addition, cost of professional services included higher personnel costs from other departments of $1.2 million related to employees who worked on services engagements.

The non-currency related increase in sales and marketing expense of $2.7 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs of $3.4 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 30 people, higher stock compensation of $0.8 million, higher severance of $0.6 million, higher information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.4 million and higher travel of $0.3 million. These higher expenses were offset by lower commissions of $4.5 million, which is partly attributable to the capitalization of commission expense in fiscal 2019 as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard, Topic 606. Commissions in fiscal 2018 was driven by stronger than anticipated new cloud business bookings in the fourth quarter and was expensed as incurred in fiscal 2018 whereas in fiscal 2019 commission expense related to new subscription and maintenance was capitalized and will be amortized over five years.\nOn a constant currency basis, sales and marketing expense was $75.4 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $7.6 million, or 11%, increase from $67.8 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in sales and marketing expense of $7.6 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher commissions of $3.2 million, higher salaries and related costs of $2.1 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 16 people, higher bonuses of $1.6 million and higher travel of $0.5 million. Stronger than anticipated new cloud business closed in the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter resulted in higher bonuses and commissions without the associated revenue, as we recognized these expenses up front, while the revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.\nResearch and Development\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change in\n\t\t\tConstant\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change due\n\t\t\tto Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Change\n\t\t\tas Reported\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fluctuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,265 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(67 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,332 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-13 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change in\n\t\t\tConstant\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change due\n\t\t\tto Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Change\n\t\t\tas Reported\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fluctuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,700 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(374 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,074 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-9 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development is expensed as incurred and consists primarily of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel expense and other personnel costs for research and development employees in addition to professional services, such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors.

The non-currency related increase in research and development expense of $6.3 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher personnel costs of $2.7 million, due in part to higher headcount of approximately 12 people, higher contractor costs of $2.1 million, higher information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.4 million and higher stock compensation of $0.4 million. We continue to invest in our new platform and user interface in addition to developing other advanced technologies such as our automated solutions product.\nOn a constant currency basis, research and development expense was $47.7 million fiscal 2018, representing a $3.7 million, or 8%, increase from $44.0 million for fiscal 2017. The non-currency related increase in research and development expense of $3.7 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs of $2.2 million, as a result of higher headcount of approximately 35 people, higher bonuses of $0.9 million and higher contractor costs of $0.6 million. These costs were a result of our investment in our Channel Islands project, which included the development of a new platform and user interface.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change in\n\t\t\tConstant\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change due\n\t\t\tto Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Change\n\t\t\tas Reported\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fluctuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and Administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(147 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change in\n\t\t\tConstant\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change due\n\t\t\tto Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Change\n\t\t\tas Reported\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fluctuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and Administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,863 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(41 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,904 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-9 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expense includes salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel expense and other personnel costs related to our finance, human resources, legal and executive personnel, as well as professional fees for accounting and legal services, bad debt expense and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs.\nOn a constant currency basis, general and administrative expense was $35.2 million for fiscal 2019, representing a $0.2 million, or 1%, decrease from $35.4 million for fiscal 2018. The non-currency related decrease in general and administrative expense of $0.2 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to lower bonuses of $0.8 million and lower stock compensation of $0.4 million partially offset by higher accounting fees of $0.4 million and higher payroll taxes of $0.2 million.\nOn a constant currency basis, general and administrative expense was $35.2 million for fiscal 2018, representing a $2.8 million, or 9%, increase from $32.4 million for fiscal 2017.

When comparing fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018, the favorable change is primarily related to higher foreign exchange gains of $2.7 million, as the U.S. dollar strengthened by approximately 10% against the euro, and higher interest income of $1.1 million due to interest rate increases. When comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017, the unfavorable change is primarily related to higher foreign exchange losses of $2.3 million, as the U.S. dollar declined approximately 10% against the euro and Mexican peso, partially offset by higher interest income of $0.9 million due to interest rate increases.\nInterest rate swap valuations and foreign exchange gains and losses are subject to changes which are inherently unpredictable. Our interest rate swap is accounted for using mark-to-market accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap each reporting period are adjusted through earnings, subjecting us to non-cash volatility in our results of operations. The swap fixes the interest rate on our mortgage to 4.31% over the entire term of the mortgage. Although the agreement allows us to prepay the loan and exit the agreement early, we have no intention of doing so. As a result, we will have non-cash adjustments through earnings each reporting period. Over the term of the mortgage, however, the net impact of these mark-to-market adjustments on earnings will be zero.\nIncome Tax Expense\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n\t\t\tCompared\n\t\t\tto Prior Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\nCompared\n\t\t\tto Prior Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nJanuary 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,368 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-69 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,419 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-75 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,276 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective tax rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-115 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recorded income tax expense of $1.5 million, $4.9 million and $19.3 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively. QAD's effective tax rate was 12%, -115%, and 504% for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We generated pre-tax income of $11.9 million in fiscal 2019 versus incurring a pre-tax loss of $(4.2) million in fiscal 2018. Income tax expense in fiscal 2018 included an accrual of $2.0 million to estimate a one-time mandatory repatriation tax owed related to the Tax Act. The calculation was further refined during fiscal 2019 and the final amount owed was $0.7 million. As a result, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. In addition, in fiscal 2019 we recorded increased deductions overseas from our equity compensation which lowered our tax expense.\nIn 2018, our effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the provisional effects of the Tax Act, our jurisdictional mix of income and equity compensation windfalls. In fiscal 2018, we recorded an accrual of $2.0 million to estimate a one-time mandatory repatriation tax related to the Tax Act. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was extraordinarily high due to a $16.3 million valuation allowance placed on U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.\nOur foreign earnings are primarily generated from China, India and Mexico. These countries have higher statutory tax rates and effective tax rates than the U.S. However, we benefit from operating in Ireland which has a lower statutory income tax rate and effective tax rate than the U.S.\nFor further information regarding income taxes, see Note 4 Income Taxes\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\u201d defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins, non-GAAP pre-tax income and estimated cash taxes on GAAP earnings each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. We define the non-GAAP measures as follows:\n \u25cf Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA is GAAP net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA less stock-based compensation expense and the change in the fair value of our interest rate swap. \n \u25cf Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins - Calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. \n \u25cf Non-GAAP pre-tax income - GAAP income before income taxes not including the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap. \n \u25cf Estimated cash taxes on GAAP earnings - Defined as GAAP total tax expense excluding changes in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits. \nQAD's management uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the business and believes that presenting non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations as well as useful metrics for monitoring our performance and evaluating it against industry peers. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should be used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure in evaluating the company.\nQAD non-GAAP measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nStock-based compensation expense: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP pre-tax income calculations. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense which generally requires cash settlement by QAD, and therefore is not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We also believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our peers.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets: We amortize purchased intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions. We have excluded the effect of amortization of purchased intangible assets, which include purchased technology, customer relationships, trade names and other intangible assets, from our non-GAAP pre-tax income calculation, because doing so makes internal comparisons to our historical operating results more consistent.
