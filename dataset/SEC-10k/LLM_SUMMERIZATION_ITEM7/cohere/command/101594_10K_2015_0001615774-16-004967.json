MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion includes forward-looking statements. Please refer to Cautionary Information about Forward-Looking Statements on pages 3 and 4 of this report for important information about these types of statements. Additionally, please refer to the Glossary of Oil and Gas Terms on pages 5 and 6 of this report for oil and gas industry terminology used herein.\nGeneral Overview\nWe are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition and development of oil and gas producing properties in the continental United States. Our business is currently focused in South Texas and the Williston Basin in North Dakota. However, we do not intend to limit our focus to these geographic areas. We continue to focus on increasing production, reserves, revenues and cash flow from operations while managing our level of debt.\nWe currently explore for and produce oil and gas through a non-operator business model; however, we may operate oil and gas properties for our own account and may expand our holdings or operations into other areas. As a non-operator, we rely on our operating partners to propose, permit and manage wells. Before a well is drilled, the operator is required to provide all oil and gas interest owners in the designated well the opportunity to participate in the drilling costs and revenues of the well on a pro-rata basis. After the well is completed, our operating partners also transport, market and account for all production. As discussed in Item 1. Business, our long-term strategic focus is to develop operational capabilities through the pursuit of opportunities to acquire operated properties and/or operatorship of existing properties.\nRecent Developments\nIn February 2016, we transferred to Mt. Emmons Mining Company, a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ( MEM\u201d), our Mt. Emmons mine site located in Gunnison County, Colorado, including the Keystone Mine, a related water treatment plant (the WTP\u201d) and other related properties (collectively, the Purchased Assets\u201d). MEM replaced the Company as the permittee and owner of the WTP and will discharge the obligation of the Company to operate the WTP in accordance with the applicable permits issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.\nAs additional consideration for MEM to accept transfer of the Purchased Assets, including related obligations, the Company entered into a Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the Series A Purchase Agreement\u201d) with MEM pursuant to which the Company issued to MEM 50,000 shares of newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock\u201d). The Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a rate of 12.250% per annum of the Adjusted Liquidation Preference (as defined), which are not payable in cash but are accrued and compounded quarterly in arrears. The Adjusted Liquidation Preference\u201d is initially $40 per share of Preferred Stock, increased each quarter by the accrued quarterly dividend. The Preferred Stock is senior to other classes or series of shares of the Company with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation. No dividend or distribution will be declared or paid on junior stock, including the Company's common stock, (1) unless approved by the holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a group and (2) unless and until a like dividend has been declared and paid on the Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis, unless waived by the holders of Preferred Stock.\nEach share of Preferred Stock may initially be converted into 80 shares of the common stock of the Company at the option of the holder at any time. The conversion rate is subject to anti-dilution adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and certain reorganization events and to price-based anti-dilution protections. Each share of Preferred Stock will be convertible into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the conversion value as adjusted for accumulated dividends divided by the initial conversion value, multiplied by (2) the conversion rate (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends accrued since the last accrual date). The Preferred Stock will generally not vote with the common stock on an as-converted basis on matters put before the Company's shareholders. The holders of the Preferred Stock have the right to approve specified matters and have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Preferred Stock in connection with a change of control.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in Note 1 - Organization, Operations and Significant Accounting Polices in Item 8 of this report. We have outlined below those policies identified as being critical to the understanding of our business and results of operations and that require the application of significant management judgment.\nOil and Gas Reserve Estimates. Our estimates of proved reserves are based on quantities of oil and gas reserves which current engineering data indicates are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Estimates of proved reserves are critical estimates in determining our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense ( DD&A\u201d) and our full cost ceiling limitation ( Full Cost Ceiling\u201d). Future cash inflows are determined by applying oil and gas prices, as adjusted for transportation, quality and basis differentials to the estimated quantities of proved reserves remaining to be produced as of the end of that period. Future production and development costs are based on costs existing at the effective date of the report. Expected cash flows are discounted to present value using a prescribed discount rate of 10% per annum.\nEstimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise because of uncertainties in projecting rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures, interpretations of geological, geophysical, engineering and production data and the quality and quantity of available data. Changing economic conditions also may affect our estimates of proved reserves due to changes in developmental costs and changes in commodity prices that may impact reservoir economics. We utilize independent reserve engineers to estimate our proved reserves at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year.\nOil and Gas Properties. We follow the full cost method in accounting for our oil and gas properties. Under the full cost method, all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in a country-wide cost center. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to development and exploration activities, but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Proceeds received from property disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.\nThe sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center are amortized using the equivalent unit-of-production method, based on proved oil and gas reserves. The capitalized costs are amortized over the life of the reserves associated with the assets, with the DD&A recognized in the period that the reserves are produced. DD&A is calculated by dividing the period's production volumes by the estimated volume of reserves associated with the investment and multiplying the calculated percentage by the sum of the capitalized investment and estimated future development costs associated with the investment. Changes in our reserve estimates will therefore result in changes in our DD&A per unit. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred.\nExploratory wells in progress are excluded from the DD&A calculation until the outcome of the well is determined. Similarly, unproved property costs are initially excluded from the DD&A calculation. Unproved property costs not subject to the DD&A calculation consist primarily of leasehold and seismic costs related to unproved areas. Unproved property costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined. Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed quarterly for impairment to determine whether we are still actively pursuing the project and whether the project has been proven either to have economic quantities of reserves or that economic quantities of reserves do not exist.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated DD&A and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed the Full Cost Ceiling. The Full Cost Ceiling is equal to the present value, discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves plus the unimpaired cost of unproved properties not subject to amortization, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties that are subject to amortization. When net capitalized costs exceed the Full Cost Ceiling, impairment is recognized.\nDerivative Instruments. We use derivative instruments, typically costless collars and fixed-rate swaps, to manage price risk underlying our oil and gas production. We may also use puts, calls and basis swaps in the future. All derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. We offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty. Although we do not designate any of our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, such derivative instruments provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with forecasted future oil and gas production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method and accordingly, we recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts currently in earnings and they are classified as gain (loss) on oil price risk derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur Board of Directors sets all risk management policies and reviews the status and results of derivative activities, including volumes, types of instruments and counterparties. The master contracts with approved counterparties identify the CEO as the Company representative authorized to execute trades.\nDiscontinued Operations- Mining Properties. Due to the disposition of our mining properties in February 2016, all of our mining properties are included in discontinued operations. Effective January 1, 2015, we adopted new accounting guidance related to the recognition and presentation of discontinued operations in our financial statements. Under the revised guidance, beginning in 2015 only disposals of businesses that represent strategic shifts that have a major effect on our operations and financial results are reported in discontinued operations. Accordingly, the disposal of our mining segment qualified for reporting as discontinued operations.\nWe capitalized all costs incidental to the acquisition of mining properties and related equipment. The costs of operating a related water treatment plant on the mine property, holding costs to maintain permits, mining exploration costs and general corporate overhead were expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized impairment of the carrying value of the mine property when we determined that the carrying value could not be recovered.\nJoint Interest Operations. We do not serve as operator for any of our oil and gas properties. Therefore, we rely to a large extent on the operator of the property to provide us with timely and accurate information about the operations of the properties. Joint interest billings from the operators serve as our primary source of information to record revenue, operating expenses and capital expenditures for our properties on a monthly basis. Many of our properties are subject to complex participation and operating agreements where our working interests and net revenue interests are subject to change upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the achievement of payout\u201d. These calculations may be subject to error and differences of interpretation which can cause uncertainties about the proper amount that should be recorded in our accounting records. When these issues arise, we make every effort to work with the operators to resolve the issues promptly.\nRevenue Recognition. We record oil and gas revenue under the sales method of accounting. Under the sales method, we recognize revenues based on the amount of oil or natural gas sold to purchasers, which may differ from the amounts to which we are entitled based on our interest in the properties. Gas balancing obligations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were not significant.\nStock Based Compensation. We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. We recognize the cost of the equity awards over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. For awards granted which contain a graded vesting schedule, and the only condition for vesting is a service condition, compensation cost is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period as if the award was, in substance, a single award.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nPlease refer to the section entitled Recent Accounting Pronouncements under Note 1 - Organization, Operations and Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 of this report for additional information on recently issued accounting standards and our plans for adoption of those standards.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of our Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss of $92.9 million as compared to a net loss of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our loss from continuing operations was $67.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to income from continuing operations of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In the following sections we discuss our revenue, operating expenses, non-operating income, and discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue. Presented below is a comparison of our oil and gas sales, production quantities and average sales prices for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except average sales prices):\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Oil </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,284 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-68 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,799 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-69 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(22,083 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-68 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production quantities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Oil (Bbls) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>221,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>329,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(108,178 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-33 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gas (Mcfe) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>813,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(259,576 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>BOE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>313,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>465,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(151,441 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-33 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average sales prices: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Oil (Bbls) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(45.07 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-52 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gas (Mcfe) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.72 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-55 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>BOE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36.78 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-53 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in our oil sales of $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from a 33% reduction in our oil production and a 52% reduction in the average oil price realized during 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in our gas sales of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven by a 32% decrease in our gas production and a 55% reduction in the average gas price realized during 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in our net realized oil and gas prices is reflective of the dramatic decrease in global commodity prices during 2015 as compared to 2014. During 2015, the differential between West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) quoted prices for crude oil and the prices we realize for sales in the Williston Basin was approximately $8.00 per barrel lower. We expect this differential to continue (with the amount of the differential varying over time) and that our oil sales revenue will be affected by lower realized prices from this region.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we produced 313,901 BOE, or an average of 860 BOE per day, as compared to 465,342 BOE or 1,275 BOE per day in 2014. Production for our Williston Basin properties decreased by 56,535 BOE during 2015, which is a 23% reduction compared to 2014. This decrease of 23% is consistent with the decrease in Williston Basin production during 2014 as a result of normal production declines and lower working interests for wells that have achieved payout. Production for our Eagle Ford and Buda properties in South Texas decreased by 91,437 BOE during 2015, which is a 50% reduction compared to 2014. This reduction was attributable to the normal decline in production for wells in this area and we did not participate in further drilling in this area during 2015.\nOil and Gas Production Costs. Presented below is a comparison of our oil and gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,737 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-63 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease operating expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,549 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,286 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, production taxes decreased by $1.7 million compared to 2014. Approximately $1.9 million of the decrease in production taxes resulted from lower oil and gas sales; this decrease was partially offset by higher tax rates in 2015 which accounted for an increase in production taxes of $0.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, lease operating expense decreased by $1.5 million which was primarily due to the implementation of cost reduction strategies by the operators of our wells. During 2016, we expect further well by well reductions as cost reductions programs continue during the industry downturn.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Our DD&A rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $26.80 per BOE compared to $31.56 per BOE for 2014. Our DD&A rate can fluctuate as a result of changes in drilling and completion costs, impairments, divestitures, changes in the mix of our production, the underlying proved reserve volumes and estimated costs to drill and complete proved undeveloped reserves. The primary factor that resulted in a reduction in our DD&A rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was quarterly impairment charges that resulted from our quarterly Full Cost Ceiling limitations. During each of the four quarters in 2015, we recognized impairment charges which reduced the net capitalized costs subject to future DD&A calculations. Accordingly, our DD&A rate per BOE decreased during 2015 as we reduced the net capitalized costs by the quarterly impairment charges discussed below.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company did not recognize any oil and gas impairment expense. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment charges related to our oil and gas properties of $57.7 million because the net capitalized costs were in excess of the Full Cost Ceiling limitation. These quarterly impairment charges were primarily due to the deepening declines in the price of oil during 2015. Presented below are the weighted average prices (before applying the impact of basis differentials between the benchmark prices and the actual prices realized for our wells) used to prepare our reserve estimates and to calculate our Full Cost Ceiling limitations for each of the four quarters in 2015, along with the impairment charges recognized during each of the four quarters in 2015 (dollars in thousands, except average prices):\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Price </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Oil </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Impairment </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Bbl) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(MMbtu) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Charge </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>First quarter </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82.72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,240 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Second quarter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,208 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Third quarter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,446 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fourth quarter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,782 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total impairment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,676 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur quarterly reserve reports are prepared based on a trailing 12-month average for benchmark oil and gas prices; therefore, the weighted average oil price used to prepare our reserve estimates and to calculate our Full Cost Ceiling limitation for the first quarter of 2016 is expected to decline from $50.28 to approximately $46.00 (both before further deduction for basis differentials). Assuming other variables remain substantially unchanged, we expect to record an impairment charge in the range of $3.0 million to $4.0 million during the first quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. Presented below is a comparison of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Compensation and benefits, including directors </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,522 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Employee severance costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/a </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees, insurance and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(516 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was attributable to a reduction of $1.5 million in compensation and benefits, which was driven by (i) a decrease in executive retirement expense of $0.6 million since the actuarial calculations indicated the retirement plan was fully funded in 2015, (ii) a decrease in compensation and benefits of $0.6 million related to the retirement of two executive officers for all or part of 2015, (iii) a decrease in employee bonuses of $0.2 million, and (iv) a decrease in board of directors' compensation of $0.1 million. Other significant changes in general and administrative expenses included (i) an increase in stock-based compensation which primarily resulted from the acceleration of vesting of stock options and restricted stock associated with employees who terminated employment in 2015, and (ii) an increase in severance expense of $0.5 million which was comprised of $0.4 million for 3 executive officers and $0.1 million for 6 other employees who terminated employment by the end of 2015.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense). Presented below is a comparison of our non-operating income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized gain (loss) on oil price risk derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(75 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(391 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-124 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unrealized gain (loss) on oil price risk derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>514 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sale of assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(68 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(68 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/a </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rental and other income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(263 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(385 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>348 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognized a realized loss on oil price risk derivatives of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a gain of $0.3 million for 2014. We recognized an unrealized gain on oil price risk derivatives of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a gain of $0.3 million for 2013. The realized and unrealized gain for 2015 was $1.6 million compared to a realized gain of $0.6 million for 2014, an improvement of $1.0 million which is indicative of the decline in the market for crude oil after we entered into the derivative contracts.\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of $0.1 million, which resulted from the sale of non-oil and gas related property and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that our marketable equity securities had experienced an other than temporary impairment in value which resulted in an unrealized loss of $0.1 million.\nInterest expense decreased by $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in our weighted average borrowing for 2015.\nDiscontinued Operations. Due to the disposition of our mining properties in February 2016, all of our mining properties are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $22.6 million when we determined that the carrying value could not be recovered. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the costs of operating our water treatment plant on the mine property, holding costs to maintain permits, and general corporate overhead associated with the mine property were expensed as incurred. The total operating and holding expenses amounted to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $3.1 million for 2014.\nComparison of our Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a net loss of $2.1 million as compared to a net loss of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our income from continuing operations was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. In the following sections we discuss our revenue, operating expenses, non-operating income, and discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nRevenue.

This impact of higher production was partially offset by a 4% reduction in the average gas price realized during 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in our oil sales of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from a 4% reduction in our oil production and a 5% reduction in the average oil price realized during 2014 compared to 2013. The differential between WTI quoted prices for crude oil and the prices we realized for sales in the Williston Basin ranged from $13.00 to $21.00 per barrel during 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we produced 465,342 BOE, or an average of 1,275 BOE per day, as compared to 424,933 BOE or 1,164 BOE per day in 2013. In our South Texas region, production increased 148% from 76,773 BOE in 2013 to 190,760 BOE in 2014 as a result of our Buda limestone drilling program. Production in our Bakken region decreased 22%, from 314,707 BOE in 2013 to 245,115 BOE in 2014 as a result of normal production declines and lower working interests in wells drilled in this region.\nOil and Gas Production Costs. Presented below is a comparison of our oil and gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(581 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease operating expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, production taxes decreased by $0.6 million as a result of the reduction in oil and gas sales and lower tax rates in 2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, lease operating expense increased by $0.8 million due to an increase in the number of producing wells and an increase in workover expense of $0.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Our DD&A rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $31.56 per BOE compared to $32.06 per BOE for 2013. Our DD&A rate can fluctuate as a result of changes in drilling and completion costs, impairments, divestitures, changes in the mix of our production, the underlying proved reserve volumes and estimated costs to drill and complete proved undeveloped reserves.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded impairment of $5.8 million since the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties were in excess of the Full Cost Ceiling limitation. This impairment, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2013, was primarily due to a decline in the price of oil, additional capitalized costs and changes in production. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company did not recognize any oil and gas impairment expense.\nOur quarterly reserve reports are prepared based on a trailing 12-month average for benchmark oil and gas prices. The weighted average oil price used to prepare reserve estimates and to calculate the Full Cost Ceiling limitation for the first quarter of 2016 is expected to decline from $50.28 to approximately $46.00 (both before further deductions for basis differentials). Assuming other variables remain substantially unchanged, we expect to record an impairment charge in the range of $3.0 million to $4.0 million during the first quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. Presented below is a comparison of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Compensation and benefits, including directors </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees, insurance and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(160 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Substantially all of this increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits, which was driven by (i) an increase in executive retirement expense of $0.5 million related to the retirement of a former executive officer, (ii) a severance payment of $0.2 million related to the retirement of a second executive officer, and (iii) an increase in board of directors' compensation of $0.1 million.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense). Presented below is a comparison of our non-operating income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized gain (loss) on oil price risk derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(338 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>193 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unrealized gain (loss) on oil price risk derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(737 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sale of assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(648 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-85 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,264 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rental and other income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-48 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(385 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(429 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,840 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognized a realized gain on oil price risk derivatives of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a loss of $0.3 million for 2013. We recognized an unrealized gain on oil price risk derivatives of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a loss of $0.7 million for 2013. The 2014 realized and unrealized gains are indicative of the decline in the market for crude oil whereby our net realized price during the fourth quarter of 2014 was 27% lower than for the fourth quarter of 2013.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of $0.1 million from the sale of non-oil and gas related property and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of $0.8 million, primarily related to the sale of our corporate aircraft and related facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded an equity loss of $0.1 million from our unconsolidated investment in Standard Steam Trust LLC ( SST\u201d). At December 31, 2013, we fully impaired the investment in SST for $2.2 million which resulted in total investment losses of $2.3 million. Since the carrying value of our investment in SST was reduced to zero, we no longer record our share of equity in earnings or losses of SST and therefore recorded no equity income or losses related to SST in 2014.\nAs a result of lower average debt balances, interest expense decreased slightly during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDiscontinued Operations. Due to the disposition of our mining properties in February 2016, all of our mining properties are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $22.6 million when we determined that the carrying value could not be recovered. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the costs of operating our water treatment plant on the mine property, holding costs to maintain permits, and general corporate overhead associated with the mine property were expensed as incurred. The total operating and holding expenses amounted to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3.2 million for 2013.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, also had discontinued operations related to the Remington Village apartment complex that was sold in September 2013. During 2013 we recognized net rental earnings of $0.4 million for the period prior to the sale of Remington Village, and we had an impairment loss of $0.1 million for a loss from the discontinued operations of Remington Village of $0.3 million in 2013.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures- Adjusted EBITDAX\nAdjusted EBITDAX represents income (loss) from continuing operations as further modified to eliminate impairments, depreciation, depletion and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, loss on investments and non-operating income or expense, income taxes, unrealized derivative gains and losses, interest expense, exploration expense, and other items set forth in the table below. Adjusted EBITDAX excludes certain items that we believe affect the comparability of operating results and can exclude items that are generally one-time in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated, such as the employee severance charges incurred in 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure that is presented because we believe it provides useful additional information to investors and analysts as a performance measure. In addition, adjusted EBITDAX is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, net cash provided by operating activities, or profitability or liquidity measures prepared under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDAX excludes some, but not all items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted EBITDAX amounts presented may not be comparable to similar metrics of other companies. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Energy One LLC, is also subject to a debt to adjusted EBITDAX ratio as one of the financial covenants under its Credit Facility and the calculation for purposes of the Credit Facility differs from our financial reporting definition.\nThe following table provides reconciliations of income (loss) from continuing operations to adjusted EBITDAX for the years ended

As discussed below, this increase was primarily attributable to (i) the classification of $6.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility as a current liability in 2015, and (ii) the recognition of contingent liabilities of $3.8 million associated with disputed ownership interests.\nOur sole source of debt financing is a revolving Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. With lower oil and gas prices during 2015, Wells Fargo decreased the borrowing base by $18.5 million to $6.0 million which is the borrowing base in effect as of December 31, 2015. Outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $6.0 million, but we did not have any unused borrowing availability as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, we violated certain covenants in our Credit Facility and we project that we may have further violations during 2016. Accordingly, this debt is classified as a current liability as of December 31, 2015. While the lender has provided limited waivers for our past noncompliance, there is no assurance that it will continue to do so if we are non-compliant in the future. The ongoing availability of this Credit Facility through the maturity date of July 30, 2017, or our receipt of funding from alternative sources, is critical to our ability to survive until oil and gas prices recover.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, we received significant overpayments due to an operator's failure to timely recognize the payout implications of our joint operating agreements. During the second quarter of 2015, the operator corrected its records and has elected to begin withholding the net revenues from all of our wells that it operates to recover these overpayments. As of December 31, 2015, the balance of the overpayment was approximately $4.2 million and based on the oil and gas prices and costs used in our reserve report as of December 31, 2015, this liability is expected to be settled in full by the first quarter of 2019, but under higher pricing scenarios this liability could be repaid earlier.\nWe believe certain operators have failed to allocate our share of non-consent ownership interests which results in contingent liabilities to the extent we have not been billed for our proportionate share of such interests, and contingent assets to the extent that we have not received our share of the net revenues. We record net contingent liabilities for the obligations that we believe are probable which amounted to $3.2 million as of December 31, 2015. The ultimate resolution of these uncertainties about our working interests and net revenue interests can extend over a long period of time and we cannot provide any assurance that these matters will be resolved within the next year.\nOur standardized measure decreased by $64.1 million during 2015 which was primarily associated with decreases in oil and gas prices. The reduction in our total assets and shareholders' equity is primarily associated with our net loss of $92.9 million during 2015, as discussed under Results of Operations herein.\nDuring the period from September 2015 through February 2016, we completed the following actions which are expected to improve our operating results in 2016 and enable our survival:\nTable 105: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>During the third quarter of 2015, we began to implement restructuring actions to reduce corporate overhead through a reduction in the size of the Company's workforce from 14 employees at the end of 2014 to one employee by January 2016. Additionally, in December 2015 we completed a move of our corporate headquarters to Denver, Colorado for better access to financial services and to improve access to oil and gas deal flow. We expect our restructuring and other cost-cutting actions will result in an overhead reduction of approximately $4.0 million on an annualized basis. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In February 2016, we completed the disposition of our mining segment, including the Keystone Mine, a related water treatment plant and other related properties. While an impairment charge of $22.6 million was recognized related to this disposition, a significant objective for completing the disposition was to improve future profitability. Following the disposition, we are no longer required to operate the water treatment plant and will not be responsible for mine holding costs, which are expected to result in estimated annual cash savings of $3.0 million. We believe the disposition of our mining segment is a major step in the transformation of the Company to solely focus on our existing oil and gas business. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In April 2016, our lender provided a limited waiver for our noncompliance with the financial covenants as of December 31, 2015 and we believe the lender will not demand repayment until an alternative lender can be obtained, although there can be no guarantee that our belief will prove to be correct. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe approximately $7.0 million of combined overhead and mining expense reductions have poised the Company to survive the current low commodity price environment, in combination with our attractive oil price risk derivative contracts for 118,900 barrels of oil, comprising 60% of expected production for 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our oil price risk derivatives amounted to $1.6 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and equivalents of $3.4 million, and after payment of severance and retirement liabilities of approximately $1.4 million in January 2016, we expect to maintain cash balances of approximately $2.0 million for some time. We also expect potential investors and lenders will find our new singular industry focus, combined with attractive producing properties and a low-cost overhead structure to be an attractive vehicle to partner with the Company during this industry downturn and low commodity price environment.\nWe project that our capital resources at December 31, 2015, together with our 2016 cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to fund operations and up to $0.2 million for workovers and other capital expenditures. In order to develop our proved undeveloped oil and gas properties, we are projecting expenditures of $3.1 million in 2017 and $5.0 million in 2018. Additionally, our long-term strategy is to acquire additional oil and gas properties at attractive prices. Our ability to finance our capital expenditure budgets for 2017 and 2018 and our ability to acquire additional producing properties is contingent upon our ability to obtain alternative financing to our Credit Facility and this alternative financing will need to provide for borrowing capacity substantially greater than our Credit Facility.\nIf we have unanticipated needs for financing in 2016, alternatives that we will consider if necessary include selling or joint venturing an interest in some of our oil and gas assets, selling our real estate assets in Wyoming, selling our marketable equity securities, issuing shares of our common stock for cash or as consideration for acquisitions, and other alternatives, as we determine how to best fund our capital programs and meet our financial obligations.\nOur capital expenditure plan and our ability to obtain sufficient funding to make anticipated capital expenditures and satisfy our financial obligations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the risk of continued low commodity prices or further reductions in those prices, the risk that breaches of covenants in our Credit Facility will not be waived and will result in liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the risk that we will be unable to enter into additional financing arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, and numerous other risks, including those discussed in Risk Factors.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,233 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(565 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,542 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,977 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(154 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,055 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,901 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Discontinued operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,441 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,985 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>544 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.5 million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $23.7 million for 2014, a decrease of $21.2 million. This decrease is primarily related to the significant cash impact caused by the reduction in our oil and gas sales, net of production costs, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.6 million as compared to cash used in investing activities of $19.5 million for 2014, an improvement of $18.9 million. The sole use of cash in our investing activities for 2015 was $3.6 million that was primarily capital expenditures for our oil and gas drilling activities. The primary sources of investing cash flows were (i) $1.5 million of proceeds from the settlement of a dispute about title to certain oil and gas properties, (ii) $1.3 million of previously restricted funds related to our executive retirement plan that were transferred to unrestricted funds in 2015, and (iii) $0.3 million of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.\nThe primary use of cash in our investing activities for 2014 was $29.8 million for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties and $1.2 million for the purchase of other property and equipment. The primary sources of investing cash flows during 2014 was (i) $11.6 million of proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties, and (ii) $0.1 million of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.\nFinancing Activities. Cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.1 million as compared to cash used in financing activities of $3.1 million for 2014, an improvement of $3.0 million. The primary use of cash in our financing activities for 2015 was $0.1 million of payments for debt issuance costs. The primary use of cash in our financing activities for 2014 was $11.0 million of principal repayments under our revolver. The primary source of financing cash flows during 2014 was $8,000 of borrowings under our revolver.\nDiscontinued Operations. Cash used in our discontinued operations was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $3.0 million for 2014, an improvement of $0.6 million. The improvement in 2015 was primarily due to a refund of $0.4 million for performance bonds and a reduction in operating expenses of $0.1 million.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations on an undiscounted basis as of December 31, 2015, and the period when each contractual obligation is due (dollars in thousands):\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Credit facility borrowings (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest payments (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>284 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Executive retirement plan </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>583 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Severance agreements </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>374 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating lease </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asset retirement obligations (3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,038 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,426 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Due to expected financial covenant violations in 2016, the lender is expected to have the ability to accelerate the maturity date of the Credit Facility from the current date of July 30, 2017. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>Without regard to the lender's right to demand acceleration discussed above, future interest payments under our Credit Facility are based on the assumption that the current borrowings of $6.0 million remain outstanding until the maturity date and that the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2015 of 2.95% remains in effect through maturity. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td>Amounts shown represent estimated future plugging and abandonment costs.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion includes forward-looking statements. Please refer to Cautionary Information about Forward-Looking Statements on pages 3 and 4 of this report for important information about these types of statements. Additionally, please refer to the Glossary of Oil and Gas Terms on pages 5 and 6 of this report for oil and gas industry terminology used herein.\nGeneral Overview\nWe are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition and development of oil and gas producing properties in the continental United States. Our business is currently focused in South Texas and the Williston Basin in North Dakota. However, we do not intend to limit our focus to these geographic areas. We continue to focus on increasing production, reserves, revenues and cash flow from operations while managing our level of debt.\nWe currently explore for and produce oil and gas through a non-operator business model; however, we may operate oil and gas properties for our own account and may expand our holdings or operations into other areas. As a non-operator, we rely on our operating partners to propose, permit and manage wells. Before a well is drilled, the operator is required to provide all oil and gas interest owners in the designated well the opportunity to participate in the drilling costs and revenues of the well on a pro-rata basis. After the well is completed, our operating partners also transport, market and account for all production. As discussed in Item 1. Business, our long-term strategic focus is to develop operational capabilities through the pursuit of opportunities to acquire operated properties and/or operatorship of existing properties.\nRecent Developments\nIn February 2016, we transferred to Mt. Emmons Mining Company, a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ( MEM\u201d), our Mt. Emmons mine site located in Gunnison County, Colorado, including the Keystone Mine, a related water treatment plant (the WTP\u201d) and other related properties (collectively, the Purchased Assets\u201d). MEM replaced the Company as the permittee and owner of the WTP and will discharge the obligation of the Company to operate the WTP in accordance with the applicable permits issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.\nAs additional consideration for MEM to accept transfer of the Purchased Assets, including related obligations, the Company entered into a Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the Series A Purchase Agreement\u201d) with MEM pursuant to which the Company issued to MEM 50,000 shares of newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock\u201d). The Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a rate of 12.250% per annum of the Adjusted Liquidation Preference (as defined), which are not payable in cash but are accrued and compounded quarterly in arrears. The Adjusted Liquidation Preference\u201d is initially $40 per share of Preferred Stock, increased each quarter by the accrued quarterly dividend. The Preferred Stock is senior to other classes or series of shares of the Company with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation. No dividend or distribution will be declared or paid on junior stock, including the Company's common stock, (1) unless approved by the holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a group and (2) unless and until a like dividend has been declared and paid on the Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis, unless waived by the holders of Preferred Stock.\nEach share of Preferred Stock may initially be converted into 80 shares of the common stock of the Company at the option of the holder at any time. The conversion rate is subject to anti-dilution adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and certain reorganization events and to price-based anti-dilution protections. Each share of Preferred Stock will be convertible into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the conversion value as adjusted for accumulated dividends divided by the initial conversion value, multiplied by (2) the conversion rate (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends accrued since the last accrual date). The Preferred Stock will generally not vote with the common stock on an as-converted basis on matters put before the Company's shareholders. The holders of the Preferred Stock have the right to approve specified matters and have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Preferred Stock in connection with a change of control.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in Note 1 - Organization, Operations and Significant Accounting Polices in Item 8 of this report. We have outlined below those policies identified as being critical to the understanding of our business and results of operations and that require the application of significant management judgment.\nOil and Gas Reserve Estimates. Our estimates of proved reserves are based on quantities of oil and gas reserves which current engineering data indicates are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Estimates of proved reserves are critical estimates in determining our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense ( DD&A\u201d) and our full cost ceiling limitation ( Full Cost Ceiling\u201d). Future cash inflows are determined by applying oil and gas prices, as adjusted for transportation, quality and basis differentials to the estimated quantities of proved reserves remaining to be produced as of the end of that period. Future production and development costs are based on costs existing at the effective date of the report. Expected cash flows are discounted to present value using a prescribed discount rate of 10% per annum.\nEstimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise because of uncertainties in projecting rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures, interpretations of geological, geophysical, engineering and production data and the quality and quantity of available data. Changing economic conditions also may affect our estimates of proved reserves due to changes in developmental costs and changes in commodity prices that may impact reservoir economics. We utilize independent reserve engineers to estimate our proved reserves at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year.\nOil and Gas Properties. We follow the full cost method in accounting for our oil and gas properties. Under the full cost method, all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in a country-wide cost center. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to development and exploration activities, but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Proceeds received from property disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.\nThe sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center are amortized using the equivalent unit-of-production method, based on proved oil and gas reserves. The capitalized costs are amortized over the life of the reserves associated with the assets, with the DD&A recognized in the period that the reserves are produced. DD&A is calculated by dividing the period's production volumes by the estimated volume of reserves associated with the investment and multiplying the calculated percentage by the sum of the capitalized investment and estimated future development costs associated with the investment. Changes in our reserve estimates will therefore result in changes in our DD&A per unit. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred.\nExploratory wells in progress are excluded from the DD&A calculation until the outcome of the well is determined. Similarly, unproved property costs are initially excluded from the DD&A calculation. Unproved property costs not subject to the DD&A calculation consist primarily of leasehold and seismic costs related to unproved areas. Unproved property costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined. Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed quarterly for impairment to determine whether we are still actively pursuing the project and whether the project has been proven either to have economic quantities of reserves or that economic quantities of reserves do not exist.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated DD&A and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed the Full Cost Ceiling. The Full Cost Ceiling is equal to the present value, discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves plus the unimpaired cost of unproved properties not subject to amortization, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties that are subject to amortization. When net capitalized costs exceed the Full Cost Ceiling, impairment is recognized.\nDerivative Instruments. We use derivative instruments, typically costless collars and fixed-rate swaps, to manage price risk underlying our oil and gas production. We may also use puts, calls and basis swaps in the future. All derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. We offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty. Although we do not designate any of our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, such derivative instruments provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with forecasted future oil and gas production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method and accordingly, we recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts currently in earnings and they are classified as gain (loss) on oil price risk derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur Board of Directors sets all risk management policies and reviews the status and results of derivative activities, including volumes, types of instruments and counterparties. The master contracts with approved counterparties identify the CEO as the Company representative authorized to execute trades.\nDiscontinued Operations- Mining Properties. Due to the disposition of our mining properties in February 2016, all of our mining properties are included in discontinued operations. Effective January 1, 2015, we adopted new accounting guidance related to the recognition and presentation of discontinued operations in our financial statements. Under the revised guidance, beginning in 2015 only disposals of businesses that represent strategic shifts that have a major effect on our operations and financial results are reported in discontinued operations. Accordingly, the disposal of our mining segment qualified for reporting as discontinued operations.\nWe capitalized all costs incidental to the acquisition of mining properties and related equipment. The costs of operating a related water treatment plant on the mine property, holding costs to maintain permits, mining exploration costs and general corporate overhead were expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized impairment of the carrying value of the mine property when we determined that the carrying value could not be recovered.\nJoint Interest Operations. We do not serve as operator for any of our oil and gas properties. Therefore, we rely to a large extent on the operator of the property to provide us with timely and accurate information about the operations of the properties. Joint interest billings from the operators serve as our primary source of information to record revenue, operating expenses and capital expenditures for our properties on a monthly basis. Many of our properties are subject to complex participation and operating agreements where our working interests and net revenue interests are subject to change upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the achievement of payout\u201d. These calculations may be subject to error and differences of interpretation which can cause uncertainties about the proper amount that should be recorded in our accounting records. When these issues arise, we make every effort to work with the operators to resolve the issues promptly.\nRevenue Recognition. We record oil and gas revenue under the sales method of accounting. Under the sales method, we recognize revenues based on the amount of oil or natural gas sold to purchasers, which may differ from the amounts to which we are entitled based on our interest in the properties. Gas balancing obligations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were not significant.\nStock Based Compensation. We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. We recognize the cost of the equity awards over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. For awards granted which contain a graded vesting schedule, and the only condition for vesting is a service condition, compensation cost is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period as if the award was, in substance, a single award.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nPlease refer to the section entitled Recent Accounting Pronouncements under Note 1 - Organization, Operations and Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 of this report for additional information on recently issued accounting standards and our plans for adoption of those standards.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of our Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss of $92.9 million as compared to a net loss of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our loss from continuing operations was $67.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to income from continuing operations of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In the following sections we discuss our revenue, operating expenses, non-operating income, and discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue. Presented below is a comparison of our oil and gas sales, production quantities and average sales prices for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except average sales prices):\n\nThe decrease in our oil sales of $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from a 33% reduction in our oil production and a 52% reduction in the average oil price realized during 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in our gas sales of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven by a 32% decrease in our gas production and a 55% reduction in the average gas price realized during 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in our net realized oil and gas prices is reflective of the dramatic decrease in global commodity prices during 2015 as compared to 2014. During 2015, the differential between West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) quoted prices for crude oil and the prices we realize for sales in the Williston Basin was approximately $8.00 per barrel lower. We expect this differential to continue (with the amount of the differential varying over time) and that our oil sales revenue will be affected by lower realized prices from this region.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we produced 313,901 BOE, or an average of 860 BOE per day, as compared to 465,342 BOE or 1,275 BOE per day in 2014. Production for our Williston Basin properties decreased by 56,535 BOE during 2015, which is a 23% reduction compared to 2014. This decrease of 23% is consistent with the decrease in Williston Basin production during 2014 as a result of normal production declines and lower working interests for wells that have achieved payout. Production for our Eagle Ford and Buda properties in South Texas decreased by 91,437 BOE during 2015, which is a 50% reduction compared to 2014. This reduction was attributable to the normal decline in production for wells in this area and we did not participate in further drilling in this area during 2015.\nOil and Gas Production Costs. Presented below is a comparison of our oil and gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, production taxes decreased by $1.7 million compared to 2014. Approximately $1.9 million of the decrease in production taxes resulted from lower oil and gas sales; this decrease was partially offset by higher tax rates in 2015 which accounted for an increase in production taxes of $0.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, lease operating expense decreased by $1.5 million which was primarily due to the implementation of cost reduction strategies by the operators of our wells. During 2016, we expect further well by well reductions as cost reductions programs continue during the industry downturn.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Our DD&A rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $26.80 per BOE compared to $31.56 per BOE for 2014. Our DD&A rate can fluctuate as a result of changes in drilling and completion costs, impairments, divestitures, changes in the mix of our production, the underlying proved reserve volumes and estimated costs to drill and complete proved undeveloped reserves. The primary factor that resulted in a reduction in our DD&A rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was quarterly impairment charges that resulted from our quarterly Full Cost Ceiling limitations. During each of the four quarters in 2015, we recognized impairment charges which reduced the net capitalized costs subject to future DD&A calculations. Accordingly, our DD&A rate per BOE decreased during 2015 as we reduced the net capitalized costs by the quarterly impairment charges discussed below.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company did not recognize any oil and gas impairment expense. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment charges related to our oil and gas properties of $57.7 million because the net capitalized costs were in excess of the Full Cost Ceiling limitation. These quarterly impairment charges were primarily due to the deepening declines in the price of oil during 2015. Presented below are the weighted average prices (before applying the impact of basis differentials between the benchmark prices and the actual prices realized for our wells) used to prepare our reserve estimates and to calculate our Full Cost Ceiling limitations for each of the four quarters in 2015, along with the impairment charges recognized during each of the four quarters in 2015 (dollars in thousands, except average prices):\n\nOur quarterly reserve reports are prepared based on a trailing 12-month average for benchmark oil and gas prices; therefore, the weighted average oil price used to prepare our reserve estimates and to calculate our Full Cost Ceiling limitation for the first quarter of 2016 is expected to decline from $50.28 to approximately $46.00 (both before further deduction for basis differentials). Assuming other variables remain substantially unchanged, we expect to record an impairment charge in the range of $3.0 million to $4.0 million during the first quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. Presented below is a comparison of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was attributable to a reduction of $1.5 million in compensation and benefits, which was driven by (i) a decrease in executive retirement expense of $0.6 million since the actuarial calculations indicated the retirement plan was fully funded in 2015, (ii) a decrease in compensation and benefits of $0.6 million related to the retirement of two executive officers for all or part of 2015, (iii) a decrease in employee bonuses of $0.2 million, and (iv) a decrease in board of directors' compensation of $0.1 million. Other significant changes in general and administrative expenses included (i) an increase in stock-based compensation which primarily resulted from the acceleration of vesting of stock options and restricted stock associated with employees who terminated employment in 2015, and (ii) an increase in severance expense of $0.5 million which was comprised of $0.4 million for 3 executive officers and $0.1 million for 6 other employees who terminated employment by the end of 2015.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense). Presented below is a comparison of our non-operating income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n\nWe recognized a realized loss on oil price risk derivatives of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a gain of $0.3 million for 2014. We recognized an unrealized gain on oil price risk derivatives of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a gain of $0.3 million for 2013. The realized and unrealized gain for 2015 was $1.6 million compared to a realized gain of $0.6 million for 2014, an improvement of $1.0 million which is indicative of the decline in the market for crude oil after we entered into the derivative contracts.\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of $0.1 million, which resulted from the sale of non-oil and gas related property and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that our marketable equity securities had experienced an other than temporary impairment in value which resulted in an unrealized loss of $0.1 million.\nInterest expense decreased by $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in our weighted average borrowing for 2015.\nDiscontinued Operations. Due to the disposition of our mining properties in February 2016, all of our mining properties are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $22.6 million when we determined that the carrying value could not be recovered. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the costs of operating our water treatment plant on the mine property, holding costs to maintain permits, and general corporate overhead associated with the mine property were expensed as incurred. The total operating and holding expenses amounted to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $3.1 million for 2014.\nComparison of our Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a net loss of $2.1 million as compared to a net loss of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our income from continuing operations was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. In the following sections we discuss our revenue, operating expenses, non-operating income, and discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nRevenue. Presented below is a comparison of our oil and gas sales, production quantities and average sales prices for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands, except average sales prices):\n\nThe increase in our gas sales of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, was driven by a 67% increase in our gas production which reflected a 214% increase in our production of NGLs during 2014. This impact of higher production was partially offset by a 4% reduction in the average gas price realized during 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in our oil sales of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from a 4% reduction in our oil production and a 5% reduction in the average oil price realized during 2014 compared to 2013. The differential between WTI quoted prices for crude oil and the prices we realized for sales in the Williston Basin ranged from $13.00 to $21.00 per barrel during 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we produced 465,342 BOE, or an average of 1,275 BOE per day, as compared to 424,933 BOE or 1,164 BOE per day in 2013. In our South Texas region, production increased 148% from 76,773 BOE in 2013 to 190,760 BOE in 2014 as a result of our Buda limestone drilling program. Production in our Bakken region decreased 22%, from 314,707 BOE in 2013 to 245,115 BOE in 2014 as a result of normal production declines and lower working interests in wells drilled in this region.\nOil and Gas Production Costs. Presented below is a comparison of our oil and gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, production taxes decreased by $0.6 million as a result of the reduction in oil and gas sales and lower tax rates in 2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, lease operating expense increased by $0.8 million due to an increase in the number of producing wells and an increase in workover expense of $0.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Our DD&A rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $31.56 per BOE compared to $32.06 per BOE for 2013. Our DD&A rate can fluctuate as a result of changes in drilling and completion costs, impairments, divestitures, changes in the mix of our production, the underlying proved reserve volumes and estimated costs to drill and complete proved undeveloped reserves.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded impairment of $5.8 million since the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties were in excess of the Full Cost Ceiling limitation. This impairment, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2013, was primarily due to a decline in the price of oil, additional capitalized costs and changes in production. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company did not recognize any oil and gas impairment expense.\nOur quarterly reserve reports are prepared based on a trailing 12-month average for benchmark oil and gas prices. The weighted average oil price used to prepare reserve estimates and to calculate the Full Cost Ceiling limitation for the first quarter of 2016 is expected to decline from $50.28 to approximately $46.00 (both before further deductions for basis differentials). Assuming other variables remain substantially unchanged, we expect to record an impairment charge in the range of $3.0 million to $4.0 million during the first quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. Presented below is a comparison of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Substantially all of this increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits, which was driven by (i) an increase in executive retirement expense of $0.5 million related to the retirement of a former executive officer, (ii) a severance payment of $0.2 million related to the retirement of a second executive officer, and (iii) an increase in board of directors' compensation of $0.1 million.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense). Presented below is a comparison of our non-operating income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\n\nWe recognized a realized gain on oil price risk derivatives of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a loss of $0.3 million for 2013. We recognized an unrealized gain on oil price risk derivatives of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a loss of $0.7 million for 2013. The 2014 realized and unrealized gains are indicative of the decline in the market for crude oil whereby our net realized price during the fourth quarter of 2014 was 27% lower than for the fourth quarter of 2013.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of $0.1 million from the sale of non-oil and gas related property and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of $0.8 million, primarily related to the sale of our corporate aircraft and related facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded an equity loss of $0.1 million from our unconsolidated investment in Standard Steam Trust LLC ( SST\u201d). At December 31, 2013, we fully impaired the investment in SST for $2.2 million which resulted in total investment losses of $2.3 million. Since the carrying value of our investment in SST was reduced to zero, we no longer record our share of equity in earnings or losses of SST and therefore recorded no equity income or losses related to SST in 2014.\nAs a result of lower average debt balances, interest expense decreased slightly during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDiscontinued Operations. Due to the disposition of our mining properties in February 2016, all of our mining properties are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $22.6 million when we determined that the carrying value could not be recovered. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the costs of operating our water treatment plant on the mine property, holding costs to maintain permits, and general corporate overhead associated with the mine property were expensed as incurred. The total operating and holding expenses amounted to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3.2 million for 2013.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, also had discontinued operations related to the Remington Village apartment complex that was sold in September 2013. During 2013 we recognized net rental earnings of $0.4 million for the period prior to the sale of Remington Village, and we had an impairment loss of $0.1 million for a loss from the discontinued operations of Remington Village of $0.3 million in 2013.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures- Adjusted EBITDAX\nAdjusted EBITDAX represents income (loss) from continuing operations as further modified to eliminate impairments, depreciation, depletion and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, loss on investments and non-operating income or expense, income taxes, unrealized derivative gains and losses, interest expense, exploration expense, and other items set forth in the table below. Adjusted EBITDAX excludes certain items that we believe affect the comparability of operating results and can exclude items that are generally one-time in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated, such as the employee severance charges incurred in 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure that is presented because we believe it provides useful additional information to investors and analysts as a performance measure. In addition, adjusted EBITDAX is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, net cash provided by operating activities, or profitability or liquidity measures prepared under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDAX excludes some, but not all items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted EBITDAX amounts presented may not be comparable to similar metrics of other companies. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Energy One LLC, is also subject to a debt to adjusted EBITDAX ratio as one of the financial covenants under its Credit Facility and the calculation for purposes of the Credit Facility differs from our financial reporting definition.\nThe following table provides reconciliations of income (loss) from continuing operations to adjusted EBITDAX for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth certain measures about our liquidity as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\n (1) Working capital deficit is computed by subtracting total current liabilities from total current assets. \n (2) The standardized measure is widely used in the oil and gas industry and is considered by lenders, institutional investors and professional analysts when comparing companies. See Footnote 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information about the standardized measure and changes therein. \n (3) The current ratio is computed by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. \n (4) The debt to equity ratio is computed by dividing total debt by total shareholders' equity. \nAs of December 31, 2015, we have a working capital deficit of $9.8 million compared to a working capital deficit of $0.7 million as of December 31, 2014, an increase of $9.1 million. As discussed below, this increase was primarily attributable to (i) the classification of $6.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility as a current liability in 2015, and (ii) the recognition of contingent liabilities of $3.8 million associated with disputed ownership interests.\nOur sole source of debt financing is a revolving Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. With lower oil and gas prices during 2015, Wells Fargo decreased the borrowing base by $18.5 million to $6.0 million which is the borrowing base in effect as of December 31, 2015. Outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $6.0 million, but we did not have any unused borrowing availability as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, we violated certain covenants in our Credit Facility and we project that we may have further violations during 2016. Accordingly, this debt is classified as a current liability as of December 31, 2015. While the lender has provided limited waivers for our past noncompliance, there is no assurance that it will continue to do so if we are non-compliant in the future. The ongoing availability of this Credit Facility through the maturity date of July 30, 2017, or our receipt of funding from alternative sources, is critical to our ability to survive until oil and gas prices recover.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, we received significant overpayments due to an operator's failure to timely recognize the payout implications of our joint operating agreements. During the second quarter of 2015, the operator corrected its records and has elected to begin withholding the net revenues from all of our wells that it operates to recover these overpayments. As of December 31, 2015, the balance of the overpayment was approximately $4.2 million and based on the oil and gas prices and costs used in our reserve report as of December 31, 2015, this liability is expected to be settled in full by the first quarter of 2019, but under higher pricing scenarios this liability could be repaid earlier.\nWe believe certain operators have failed to allocate our share of non-consent ownership interests which results in contingent liabilities to the extent we have not been billed for our proportionate share of such interests, and contingent assets to the extent that we have not received our share of the net revenues. We record net contingent liabilities for the obligations that we believe are probable which amounted to $3.2 million as of December 31, 2015. The ultimate resolution of these uncertainties about our working interests and net revenue interests can extend over a long period of time and we cannot provide any assurance that these matters will be resolved within the next year.\nOur standardized measure decreased by $64.1 million during 2015 which was primarily associated with decreases in oil and gas prices. The reduction in our total assets and shareholders' equity is primarily associated with our net loss of $92.9 million during 2015, as discussed under Results of Operations herein.\nDuring the period from September 2015 through February 2016, we completed the following actions which are expected to improve our operating results in 2016 and enable our survival:\n \u00b7 During the third quarter of 2015, we began to implement restructuring actions to reduce corporate overhead through a reduction in the size of the Company's workforce from 14 employees at the end of 2014 to one employee by January 2016. Additionally, in December 2015 we completed a move of our corporate headquarters to Denver, Colorado for better access to financial services and to improve access to oil and gas deal flow. We expect our restructuring and other cost-cutting actions will result in an", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion includes forward-looking statements. Please refer to Cautionary Information about Forward-Looking Statements on pages 3 and 4 of this report for important information about these types of statements. Additionally, please refer to the Glossary of Oil and Gas Terms on pages 5 and 6 of this report for oil and gas industry terminology used herein.\nGeneral Overview\nWe are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition and development of oil and gas producing properties in the continental United States. Our business is currently focused in South Texas and the Williston Basin in North Dakota. However, we do not intend to limit our focus to these geographic areas. We continue to focus on increasing production, reserves, revenues and cash flow from operations while managing our level of debt.\nWe currently explore for and produce oil and gas through a non-operator business model; however, we may operate oil and gas properties for our own account and may expand our holdings or operations into other areas. As a non-operator, we rely on our operating partners to propose, permit and manage wells. Before a well is drilled, the operator is required to provide all oil and gas interest owners in the designated well the opportunity to participate in the drilling costs and revenues of the well on a pro-rata basis. After the well is completed, our operating partners also transport, market and account for all production. As discussed in Item 1. Business, our long-term strategic focus is to develop operational capabilities through the pursuit of opportunities to acquire operated properties and/or operatorship of existing properties.\nRecent Developments\nIn February 2016, we transferred to Mt. Emmons Mining Company, a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ( MEM\u201d), our Mt. Emmons mine site located in Gunnison County, Colorado, including the Keystone Mine, a related water treatment plant (the WTP\u201d) and other related properties (collectively, the Purchased Assets\u201d). MEM replaced the Company as the permittee and owner of the WTP and will discharge the obligation of the Company to operate the WTP in accordance with the applicable permits issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.\nAs additional consideration for MEM to accept transfer of the Purchased Assets, including related obligations, the Company entered into a Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the Series A Purchase Agreement\u201d) with MEM pursuant to which the Company issued to MEM 50,000 shares of newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock\u201d). The Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a rate of 12.250% per annum of the Adjusted Liquidation Preference (as defined), which are not payable in cash but are accrued and compounded quarterly in arrears. The Adjusted Liquidation Preference\u201d is initially $40 per share of Preferred Stock, increased each quarter by the accrued quarterly dividend. The Preferred Stock is senior to other classes or series of shares of the Company with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation. No dividend or distribution will be declared or paid on junior stock, including the Company's common stock, (1) unless approved by the holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a group and (2) unless and until a like dividend has been declared and paid on the Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis, unless waived by the holders of Preferred Stock.\nEach share of Preferred Stock may initially be converted into 80 shares of the common stock of the Company at the option of the holder at any time. The conversion rate is subject to anti-dilution adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and certain reorganization events and to price-based anti-dilution protections. Each share of Preferred Stock will be convertible into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the conversion value as adjusted for accumulated dividends divided by the initial conversion value, multiplied by (2) the conversion rate (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends accrued since the last accrual date). The Preferred Stock will generally not vote with the common stock on an as-converted basis on matters put before the Company's shareholders. The holders of the Preferred Stock have the right to approve specified matters and have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Preferred Stock in connection with a change of control.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in Note 1 - Organization, Operations and Significant Accounting Polices in Item 8 of this report. We have outlined below those policies identified as being critical to the understanding of our business and results of operations and that require the application of significant management judgment.\nOil and Gas Reserve Estimates. Our estimates of proved reserves are based on quantities of oil and gas reserves which current engineering data indicates are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Estimates of proved reserves are critical estimates in determining our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense ( DD&A\u201d) and our full cost ceiling limitation ( Full Cost Ceiling\u201d). Future cash inflows are determined by applying oil and gas prices, as adjusted for transportation, quality and basis differentials to the estimated quantities of proved reserves remaining to be produced as of the end of that period. Future production and development costs are based on costs existing at the effective date of the report. Expected cash flows are discounted to present value using a prescribed discount rate of 10% per annum.\nEstimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise because of uncertainties in projecting rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures, interpretations of geological, geophysical, engineering and production data and the quality and quantity of available data. Changing economic conditions also may affect our estimates of proved reserves due to changes in developmental costs and changes in commodity prices that may impact reservoir economics. We utilize independent reserve engineers to estimate our proved reserves at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year.\nOil and Gas Properties. We follow the full cost method in accounting for our oil and gas properties. Under the full cost method, all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in a country-wide cost center. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to development and exploration activities, but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Proceeds received from property disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.\nThe sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center are amortized using the equivalent unit-of-production method, based on proved oil and gas reserves. The capitalized costs are amortized over the life of the reserves associated with the assets, with the DD&A recognized in the period that the reserves are produced. DD&A is calculated by dividing the period's production volumes by the estimated volume of reserves associated with the investment and multiplying the calculated percentage by the sum of the capitalized investment and estimated future development costs associated with the investment. Changes in our reserve estimates will therefore result in changes in our DD&A per unit. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred.\nExploratory wells in progress are excluded from the DD&A calculation until the outcome of the well is determined. Similarly, unproved property costs are initially excluded from the DD&A calculation. Unproved property costs not subject to the DD&A calculation consist primarily of leasehold and seismic costs related to unproved areas. Unproved property costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined. Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed quarterly for impairment to determine whether we are still actively pursuing the project and whether the project has been proven either to have economic quantities of reserves or that economic quantities of reserves do not exist.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated DD&A and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed the Full Cost Ceiling. The Full Cost Ceiling is equal to the present value, discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves plus the unimpaired cost of unproved properties not subject to amortization, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties that are subject to amortization. When net capitalized costs exceed the Full Cost Ceiling, impairment is recognized.\nDerivative Instruments. We use derivative instruments, typically costless collars and fixed-rate swaps, to manage price risk underlying our oil and gas production. We may also use puts, calls and basis swaps in the future. All derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. We offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty. Although we do not designate any of our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, such derivative instruments provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with forecasted future oil and gas production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method and accordingly, we recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts currently in earnings and they are classified as gain (loss) on oil price risk derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur Board of Directors sets all risk management policies and reviews the status and results of derivative activities, including volumes, types of instruments and counterparties. The master contracts with approved counterparties identify the CEO as the Company representative authorized to execute trades.\nDiscontinued Operations- Mining Properties. Due to the disposition of our mining properties in February 2016, all of our mining properties are included in discontinued operations. Effective January 1, 2015, we adopted new accounting guidance related to the recognition and presentation of discontinued operations in our financial statements. Under the revised guidance, beginning in 2015 only disposals of businesses that represent strategic shifts that have a major effect on our operations and financial results are reported in discontinued operations. Accordingly, the disposal of our mining segment qualified for reporting as discontinued operations.\nWe capitalized all costs incidental to the acquisition of mining properties and related equipment. The costs of operating a related water treatment plant on the mine property, holding costs to maintain permits, mining exploration costs and general corporate overhead were expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized impairment of the carrying value of the mine property when we determined that the carrying value could not be recovered.\nJoint Interest Operations. We do not serve as operator for any of our oil and gas properties. Therefore, we rely to a large extent on the operator of the property to provide us with timely and accurate information about the operations of the properties. Joint interest billings from the operators serve as our primary source of information to record revenue, operating expenses and capital expenditures for our properties on a monthly basis. Many of our properties are subject to complex participation and operating agreements where our working interests and net revenue interests are subject to change upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the achievement of payout\u201d. These calculations may be subject to error and differences of interpretation which can cause uncertainties about the proper amount that should be recorded in our accounting records. When these issues arise, we make every effort to work with the operators to resolve the issues promptly.\nRevenue Recognition. We record oil and gas revenue under the sales method of accounting. Under the sales method, we recognize revenues based on the amount of oil or natural gas sold to purchasers, which may differ from the amounts to which we are entitled based on our interest in the properties. Gas balancing obligations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were not significant.\nStock Based Compensation. We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. We recognize the cost of the equity awards over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. For awards granted which contain a graded vesting schedule, and the only condition for vesting is a service condition, compensation cost is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period as if the award was, in substance, a single award.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nPlease refer to the section entitled Recent Accounting Pronouncements under Note 1 - Organization, Operations and Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 of this report for additional information on recently issued accounting standards and our plans for adoption of those standards.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of our Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss of $92.9 million as compared to a net loss of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our loss from continuing operations was $67.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to income from continuing operations of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In the following sections we discuss our revenue, operating expenses, non-operating income, and discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue. Presented below is a comparison of our oil and gas sales, production quantities and average sales prices for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except average sales prices):\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Oil </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,284 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-68 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,799 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-69 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(22,083 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-68 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production quantities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Oil (Bbls) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>221,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>329,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(108,178 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-33 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gas (Mcfe) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>813,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(259,576 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>BOE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>313,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>465,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(151,441 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-33 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average sales prices: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Oil (Bbls) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(45.07 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-52 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gas (Mcfe) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.72 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-55 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>BOE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36.78 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-53 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in our oil sales of $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from a 33% reduction in our oil production and a 52% reduction in the average oil price realized during 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in our gas sales of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven by a 32% decrease in our gas production and a 55% reduction in the average gas price realized during 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in our net realized oil and gas prices is reflective of the dramatic decrease in global commodity prices during 2015 as compared to 2014. During 2015, the differential between West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) quoted prices for crude oil and the prices we realize for sales in the Williston Basin was approximately $8.00 per barrel lower. We expect this differential to continue (with the amount of the differential varying over time) and that our oil sales revenue will be affected by lower realized prices from this region.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we produced 313,901 BOE, or an average of 860 BOE per day, as compared to 465,342 BOE or 1,275 BOE per day in 2014. Production for our Williston Basin properties decreased by 56,535 BOE during 2015, which is a 23% reduction compared to 2014. This decrease of 23% is consistent with the decrease in Williston Basin production during 2014 as a result of normal production declines and lower working interests for wells that have achieved payout. Production for our Eagle Ford and Buda properties in South Texas decreased by 91,437 BOE during 2015, which is a 50% reduction compared to 2014. This reduction was attributable to the normal decline in production for wells in this area and we did not participate in further drilling in this area during 2015.\nOil and Gas Production Costs. Presented below is a comparison of our oil and gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,737 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-63 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease operating expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,549 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,286 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, production taxes decreased by $1.7 million compared to 2014. Approximately $1.9 million of the decrease in production taxes resulted from lower oil and gas sales; this decrease was partially offset by higher tax rates in 2015 which accounted for an increase in production taxes of $0.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, lease operating expense decreased by $1.5 million which was primarily due to the implementation of cost reduction strategies by the operators of our wells. During 2016, we expect further well by well reductions as cost reductions programs continue during the industry downturn.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Our DD&A rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $26.80 per BOE compared to $31.56 per BOE for 2014. Our DD&A rate can fluctuate as a result of changes in drilling and completion costs, impairments, divestitures, changes in the mix of our production, the underlying proved reserve volumes and estimated costs to drill and complete proved undeveloped reserves. The primary factor that resulted in a reduction in our DD&A rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was quarterly impairment charges that resulted from our quarterly Full Cost Ceiling limitations. During each of the four quarters in 2015, we recognized impairment charges which reduced the net capitalized costs subject to future DD&A calculations. Accordingly, our DD&A rate per BOE decreased during 2015 as we reduced the net capitalized costs by the quarterly impairment charges discussed below.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company did not recognize any oil and gas impairment expense. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment charges related to our oil and gas properties of $57.7 million because the net capitalized costs were in excess of the Full Cost Ceiling limitation. These quarterly impairment charges were primarily due to the deepening declines in the price of oil during 2015. Presented below are the weighted average prices (before applying the impact of basis differentials between the benchmark prices and the actual prices realized for our wells) used to prepare our reserve estimates and to calculate our Full Cost Ceiling limitations for each of the four quarters in 2015, along with the impairment charges recognized during each of the four quarters in 2015 (dollars in thousands, except average prices):\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Price </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Oil </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Impairment </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Bbl) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(MMbtu) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Charge </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>First quarter </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82.72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,240 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Second quarter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,208 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Third quarter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,446 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fourth quarter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,782 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total impairment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,676 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur quarterly reserve reports are prepared based on a trailing 12-month average for benchmark oil and gas prices; therefore, the weighted average oil price used to prepare our reserve estimates and to calculate our Full Cost Ceiling limitation for the first quarter of 2016 is expected to decline from $50.28 to approximately $46.00 (both before further deduction for basis differentials). Assuming other variables remain substantially unchanged, we expect to record an impairment charge in the range of $3.0 million to $4.0 million during the first quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. Presented below is a comparison of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Compensation and benefits, including directors </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,522 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Employee severance costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/a </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees, insurance and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(516 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was attributable to a reduction of $1.5 million in compensation and benefits, which was driven by (i) a decrease in executive retirement expense of $0.6 million since the actuarial calculations indicated the retirement plan was fully funded in 2015, (ii) a decrease in compensation and benefits of $0.6 million related to the retirement of two executive officers for all or part of 2015, (iii) a decrease in employee bonuses of $0.2 million, and (iv) a decrease in board of directors' compensation of $0.1 million. Other significant changes in general and administrative expenses included (i) an increase in stock-based compensation which primarily resulted from the acceleration of vesting of stock options and restricted stock associated with employees who terminated employment in 2015, and (ii) an increase in severance expense of $0.5 million which was comprised of $0.4 million for 3 executive officers and $0.1 million for 6 other employees who terminated employment by the end of 2015.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense).

We recognized an unrealized gain on oil price risk derivatives of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a gain of $0.3 million for 2013. The realized and unrealized gain for 2015 was $1.6 million compared to a realized gain of $0.6 million for 2014, an improvement of $1.0 million which is indicative of the decline in the market for crude oil after we entered into the derivative contracts.\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of $0.1 million, which resulted from the sale of non-oil and gas related property and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that our marketable equity securities had experienced an other than temporary impairment in value which resulted in an unrealized loss of $0.1 million.\nInterest expense decreased by $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in our weighted average borrowing for 2015.\nDiscontinued Operations. Due to the disposition of our mining properties in February 2016, all of our mining properties are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $22.6 million when we determined that the carrying value could not be recovered. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the costs of operating our water treatment plant on the mine property, holding costs to maintain permits, and general corporate overhead associated with the mine property were expensed as incurred. The total operating and holding expenses amounted to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $3.1 million for 2014.\nComparison of our Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a net loss of $2.1 million as compared to a net loss of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our income from continuing operations was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. In the following sections we discuss our revenue, operating expenses, non-operating income, and discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nRevenue.

This impact of higher production was partially offset by a 4% reduction in the average gas price realized during 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in our oil sales of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from a 4% reduction in our oil production and a 5% reduction in the average oil price realized during 2014 compared to 2013. The differential between WTI quoted prices for crude oil and the prices we realized for sales in the Williston Basin ranged from $13.00 to $21.00 per barrel during 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we produced 465,342 BOE, or an average of 1,275 BOE per day, as compared to 424,933 BOE or 1,164 BOE per day in 2013. In our South Texas region, production increased 148% from 76,773 BOE in 2013 to 190,760 BOE in 2014 as a result of our Buda limestone drilling program. Production in our Bakken region decreased 22%, from 314,707 BOE in 2013 to 245,115 BOE in 2014 as a result of normal production declines and lower working interests in wells drilled in this region.\nOil and Gas Production Costs. Presented below is a comparison of our oil and gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(581 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease operating expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, production taxes decreased by $0.6 million as a result of the reduction in oil and gas sales and lower tax rates in 2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, lease operating expense increased by $0.8 million due to an increase in the number of producing wells and an increase in workover expense of $0.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization. Our DD&A rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $31.56 per BOE compared to $32.06 per BOE for 2013. Our DD&A rate can fluctuate as a result of changes in drilling and completion costs, impairments, divestitures, changes in the mix of our production, the underlying proved reserve volumes and estimated costs to drill and complete proved undeveloped reserves.\nImpairment of oil and gas properties. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded impairment of $5.8 million since the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties were in excess of the Full Cost Ceiling limitation. This impairment, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2013, was primarily due to a decline in the price of oil, additional capitalized costs and changes in production. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company did not recognize any oil and gas impairment expense.\nOur quarterly reserve reports are prepared based on a trailing 12-month average for benchmark oil and gas prices. The weighted average oil price used to prepare reserve estimates and to calculate the Full Cost Ceiling limitation for the first quarter of 2016 is expected to decline from $50.28 to approximately $46.00 (both before further deductions for basis differentials). Assuming other variables remain substantially unchanged, we expect to record an impairment charge in the range of $3.0 million to $4.0 million during the first quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses.

Substantially all of this increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits, which was driven by (i) an increase in executive retirement expense of $0.5 million related to the retirement of a former executive officer, (ii) a severance payment of $0.2 million related to the retirement of a second executive officer, and (iii) an increase in board of directors' compensation of $0.1 million.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense).

We recognized an unrealized gain on oil price risk derivatives of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a loss of $0.7 million for 2013. The 2014 realized and unrealized gains are indicative of the decline in the market for crude oil whereby our net realized price during the fourth quarter of 2014 was 27% lower than for the fourth quarter of 2013.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of $0.1 million from the sale of non-oil and gas related property and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of $0.8 million, primarily related to the sale of our corporate aircraft and related facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded an equity loss of $0.1 million from our unconsolidated investment in Standard Steam Trust LLC ( SST\u201d). At December 31, 2013, we fully impaired the investment in SST for $2.2 million which resulted in total investment losses of $2.3 million. Since the carrying value of our investment in SST was reduced to zero, we no longer record our share of equity in earnings or losses of SST and therefore recorded no equity income or losses related to SST in 2014.\nAs a result of lower average debt balances, interest expense decreased slightly during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDiscontinued Operations. Due to the disposition of our mining properties in February 2016, all of our mining properties are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $22.6 million when we determined that the carrying value could not be recovered. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the costs of operating our water treatment plant on the mine property, holding costs to maintain permits, and general corporate overhead associated with the mine property were expensed as incurred. The total operating and holding expenses amounted to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3.2 million for 2013.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, also had discontinued operations related to the Remington Village apartment complex that was sold in September 2013. During 2013 we recognized net rental earnings of $0.4 million for the period prior to the sale of Remington Village, and we had an impairment loss of $0.1 million for a loss from the discontinued operations of Remington Village of $0.3 million in 2013.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures- Adjusted EBITDAX\nAdjusted EBITDAX represents income (loss) from continuing operations as further modified to eliminate impairments, depreciation, depletion and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, loss on investments and non-operating income or expense, income taxes, unrealized derivative gains and losses, interest expense, exploration expense, and other items set forth in the table below. Adjusted EBITDAX excludes certain items that we believe affect the comparability of operating results and can exclude items that are generally one-time in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated, such as the employee severance charges incurred in 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure that is presented because we believe it provides useful additional information to investors and analysts as a performance measure. In addition, adjusted EBITDAX is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, net cash provided by operating activities, or profitability or liquidity measures prepared under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDAX excludes some, but not all items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted EBITDAX amounts presented may not be comparable to similar metrics of other companies. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Energy One LLC, is also subject to a debt to adjusted EBITDAX ratio as one of the financial covenants under its Credit Facility and the calculation for purposes of the Credit Facility differs from our financial reporting definition.\nThe following table provides reconciliations of income (loss) from continuing operations to adjusted EBITDAX for the years ended

used in the oil and gas industry and is considered by lenders, institutional investors and professional analysts when comparing companies. See Footnote 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information about the standardized measure and changes therein. \n (3) The current ratio is computed by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. \n (4) The debt to equity ratio is computed by dividing total debt by total shareholders' equity. \nAs of December 31, 2015, we have a working capital deficit of $9.8 million compared to a working capital deficit of $0.7 million as of December 31, 2014, an increase of $9.1 million. As discussed below, this increase was primarily attributable to (i) the classification of $6.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility as a current liability in 2015, and (ii) the recognition of contingent liabilities of $3.8 million associated with disputed ownership interests.\nOur sole source of debt financing is a revolving Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. With lower oil and gas prices during 2015, Wells Fargo decreased the borrowing base by $18.5 million to $6.0 million which is the borrowing base in effect as of December 31, 2015. Outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $6.0 million, but we did not have any unused borrowing availability as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, we violated certain covenants in our Credit Facility and we project that we may have further violations during 2016. Accordingly, this debt is classified as a current liability as of December 31, 2015. While the lender has provided limited waivers for our past noncompliance, there is no assurance that it will continue to do so if we are non-compliant in the future. The ongoing availability of this Credit Facility through the maturity date of July 30, 2017, or our receipt of funding from alternative sources, is critical to our ability to survive until oil and gas prices recover.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, we received significant overpayments due to an operator's failure to timely recognize the payout implications of our joint operating agreements. During the second quarter of 2015, the operator corrected its records and has elected to begin withholding the net revenues from all of our wells that it operates to recover these overpayments. As of December 31, 2015, the balance of the overpayment was approximately $4.2 million and based on the oil and gas prices and costs used in our reserve report as of December 31, 2015, this liability is expected to be settled in full by the first quarter of 2019, but under higher pricing scenarios this liability could be repaid earlier.\nWe believe certain operators have failed to allocate our share of non-consent ownership interests which results in contingent liabilities to the extent we have not been billed for our proportionate share of such interests, and contingent assets to the extent that we have not received our share of the net revenues. We record net contingent liabilities for the obligations that we believe are probable which amounted to $3.2 million as of December 31, 2015. The ultimate resolution of these uncertainties about our working interests and net revenue interests can extend over a long period of time and we cannot provide any assurance that these matters will be resolved within the next year.\nOur standardized measure decreased by $64.1 million during 2015 which was primarily associated with decreases in oil and gas prices. The reduction in our total assets and shareholders' equity is primarily associated with our net loss of $92.9 million during 2015, as discussed under Results of Operations herein.\nDuring the period from September 2015 through February 2016, we completed the following actions which are expected to improve our operating results in 2016 and enable our survival:\n \u00b7 During the third quarter of 2015, we began to implement restructuring actions to reduce corporate overhead through a reduction in the size of the Company's workforce from 14 employees at the end of 2014 to one employee by January 2016. Additionally, in December 2015 we completed a move of our corporate headquarters to Denver, Colorado for better access to financial services and to improve access to oil and gas deal flow. We expect our restructuring and other cost-cutting actions will result in an"}
