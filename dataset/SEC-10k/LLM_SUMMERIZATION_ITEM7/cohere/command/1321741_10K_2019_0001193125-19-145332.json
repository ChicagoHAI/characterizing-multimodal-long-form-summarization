MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. Historical financial condition and results of operations and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of financial condition, results of operations or percentage relationships for any future periods. Except per share amounts, dollar amounts included herein are in thousands unless otherwise indicated.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe were incorporated under the General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware on February 18, 2005. On June 22, 2005, we completed our initial public offering and commenced operations. We operate as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company and have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to continue to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes and obtain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must meet certain requirements, including certain minimum distribution requirements.\nWe were established for the purpose of investing in debt and equity securities of established private businesses operating in the U.S. Our investment objectives are to: (i) achieve and grow current income by investing in debt securities of established businesses that we believe will provide stable earnings and cash flow to pay expenses, make principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to stockholders that grow over time; and (ii) provide our stockholders with long-term capital appreciation in the value of our assets by investing in equity securities of established businesses, generally, in combination with the aforementioned debt securities, that we believe can grow over time to permit us to sell our equity investments for capital gains. To achieve our investment objectives, our investment strategy is to invest in several categories of debt and equity securities, with individual investments generally totaling up to $30 million, although investment size may vary, depending upon our total assets or available capital at the time of investment. We expect that our investment portfolio over time will consist of approximately 75% in debt securities and 25% in equity securities, at cost. As of March 31, 2019, our investment portfolio was made up of 75.1% in debt securities and 24.9% in equity securities, at cost.\nWe focus on investing in Lower Middle Market businesses in the U.S. that meet certain criteria, including the following: the sustainability of the business' free cash flow and its ability to grow it over time, adequate assets for loan collateral, experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the portfolio company, reasonable capitalization of the portfolio company, including an ample equity contribution or cushion based on prevailing enterprise valuation multiples, and the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position, if any. We anticipate that liquidity in our equity position will be achieved through a merger or acquisition of the portfolio company, a public offering of the portfolio company's stock or, to a lesser extent, by exercising our right to require the portfolio company to repurchase our warrants, as applicable, though there can be no assurance that we will always have these rights. We invest in portfolio companies that need funds for growth capital, to finance acquisitions, including management buyouts, or to recapitalize or, to a lesser extent, refinance their existing debt facilities. We seek to avoid investing in high-risk, early-stage enterprises.\nWe invest by ourselves or jointly with other funds and/or management of the portfolio company, depending on the opportunity, and have opportunistically made several co-investments with our affiliate Gladstone Capital pursuant to the Co-Investment Order. We believe the Co-Investment Order has enhanced and will continue to enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategies. If we are participating in an investment with one or more co-investors, whether or not an affiliate of ours, our investment is likely to be smaller than if we were investing alone.\nBusiness\nPortfolio Activity\nWhile the business environment remains competitive, we continue to see new investment opportunities consistent with our investment strategy of providing a combination of debt and equity in support of management and independent sponsor-led buyouts of Lower Middle Market companies in the U.S. During the year ended March 31, 2019, we exited five portfolio companies with a combined fair value prior to their exits of $131.4 million, and invested $57.8 million in two new portfolio companies, resulting in a net reduction of three companies in our portfolio, which was comprised of 30 companies as of March 31, 2019. From our initial public offering in June 2005 through March 31, 2019, we made investments in 49 companies, excluding investments in syndicated loans, for a total of approximately $1 billion, before giving effect to principal repayments and divestitures.\nThe majority of the debt securities in our portfolio have a success fee component, which enhances the yield on our debt investments. Unlike PIK income, we generally do not recognize success fees as income until payment has been received. Due to the contingent nature of success fees, there are no guarantees that we will be able to collect any or all of these success fees or know the timing of any such collections. As a result, as of March 31, 2019, we had unrecognized, contractual success fees of $30.1 million, or $0.92 per common share. Consistent with GAAP, we generally have not recognized success fee receivables and related income in our Consolidated Financial Statements until earned.\nFrom inception through March 31, 2019, we completed sales of 16 portfolio companies that we acquired under our buyout strategy (which excludes investments in syndicated loans). In the aggregate, these sales have generated $185.9 million in net realized gains and $23.4 million in other income upon exit, for a total increase to our net assets of $209.3 million. We believe, in aggregate, these transactions were equity-oriented investment successes and exemplify our investment strategy of striving to achieve returns through current income on the debt portion of our investments and capital gains from the equity portion. The 16 liquidity events have offset any realized losses since inception, which were primarily incurred during the recession in connection with the sale of performing syndicated loans at a realized loss to pay off a former lender. These successful exits, in part, enabled us to increase the monthly distribution by 70.0% from March 2011 through March 31, 2019, and allowed us to declare and pay a $0.03 per common share supplemental distribution in fiscal year 2012, a $0.05 per common share supplemental distribution in November 2013, a $0.05 per common share supplemental distribution in December 2014, and a $0.06 per common share supplemental distribution in each of June 2017, December 2017, June 2018, and December 2018.\nCapital Raising Efforts\nWe have been able to meet our capital needs through extensions of and increases to the Credit Facility and by accessing the capital markets in the form of public offerings of common and preferred stock. We have successfully extended the Credit Facility's revolving period multiple times, most recently to August 2021, and currently have a total commitment amount of $200.0 million (with a potential total commitment of $300.0 million through additional commitments of new or existing lenders). During the year ended March 31, 2019, we sold 168,824 shares of our common stock under our at-the-market program for gross proceeds of approximately $1.9 million. During the year ended March 31, 2018, we sold 127,412 shares of our common stock under our at-the-market program for gross proceeds of approximately $1.3 million. Additionally, we issued approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $21.2 million in May 2017, inclusive of the June 2017 over-allotment, and approximately 3.0 million shares of our Series E Term Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $74.8 million in August 2018. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Line of Credit\u201d for further discussion of the Credit Facility and to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Common Stock\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Term Preferred Stock\u201d for further discussion of our common stock, including our at-the-market program, and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.\nAlthough we have been able to access the capital markets historically, market conditions may continue to affect the trading price of our common stock and thus our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of common equity. On March 31, 2019, the closing market price of our common stock was $11.60 per share, which represented a 6.5% discount to our March 31, 2019 NAV per share of $12.40. When our common stock trades below NAV, our ability to issue additional equity is constrained by provisions of the 1940 Act, which generally prohibits the issuance and sale of our common stock at an issuance price below the then current NAV per share without stockholder approval, other than through sales to our then existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering.\nAt our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on August 9, 2018, our stockholders approved a proposal authorizing us to issue and sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current NAV per share, subject to certain limitations, including that the number of common shares issued and sold pursuant to such authority does not exceed 25.0% of our then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale, provided that our Board of Directors makes certain determinations prior to any such sale. This August 2018 stockholder authorization is in effect for one year from the date of stockholder approval. We sought and obtained stockholder approval concerning similar proposals at each Annual Meeting of Stockholders since 2008, and with our Board of Directors' subsequent approval, we issued shares of our common stock in three offerings at a price below the then current NAV per share, once in May 2017, once in March 2015, and once in October 2012. Certain sales under the at-the-market program in March 2018 and April 2018 were also below the then current estimated NAV per share. The resulting proceeds, in part, have allowed us to (i) grow our portfolio by making new investments, (ii) generate additional income through these new investments, (iii) ensure continued compliance with regulatory tests and (iv) increase our debt capital while still complying with our applicable debt-to-equity ratios. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Common Stock\u201d for further discussion of our common stock.\nRegulatory Compliance\nOur ability to seek external debt financing, to the extent that it is available under current market conditions, is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the 1940 Act, which require us to have asset coverage (as defined in Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, as amended) of at least 150% on each of our senior securities representing indebtedness and our senior securities that are stock (such as our two series of term preferred stock).\nOn April 10, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a \u201crequired majority\u201d (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) thereof, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA. As a result, the Company's asset coverage requirements for senior securities changed from 200% to 150% effective April 10, 2019, one year after the date of the Board of Directors' approval. Under the 200% asset coverage standard prior to April 10, 2019, we were able to borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $1.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Starting from April 10, 2019, under the 150% asset coverage standard, we may borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $2.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Notwithstanding the modified asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act described above, we are separately subject to a minimum asset coverage requirement of 200% with respect to our Series D Term Preferred Stock.\nAs of March 31, 2019, our asset coverage ratio on our senior securities representing indebtedness was 997.6% and our asset coverage on our senior securities that are stock (our Series D Term Preferred Stock and our Series E Term Preferred Stock) was 309.1%.\nInvestment Highlights\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, and inclusive of non-cash transactions, we invested $57.8 million in two new portfolio companies, received $175.8 million in proceeds from repayments and sales, and extended $54.3 million of follow-on investments to existing portfolio companies through revolver draws, term loans, and additions to equity, as applicable.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the following significant transactions occurred:\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> In April 2018, we invested $29.2 million in Bassett Creek Restoration, Inc.

This increase was due to increases in both interest income and dividend, success fee, and other income.\nInterest income from our investments in debt securities increased 1.7% for the year ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year. Generally, the level of interest income from investments is directly related to the principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio outstanding during the period multiplied by the weighted-average yield. The weighted-average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio during the year ended March 31, 2019 was $380.2 million, compared to $373.4 million during the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the origination of $44.3 million of new debt investments and $51.7 million of follow-on debt investments to existing portfolio companies and $16.5 million of loans placed back on accrual status after March 31, 2018, partially offset by the pay-off or restructure of $65.3 million of debt investments and $68.3 million of loans placed on non-accrual status, and their respective impact on the weighted-average principal balance when considering the timing of new investments, pay-offs, restructures, and accrual status changes, as applicable. The weighted-average yield on our interest-bearing investments, excluding cash and cash equivalents and receipts recorded as other income, was 13.0% and 13.1% for the year ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted-average yield may vary from period to period, based on the current stated interest rate on interest-bearing investments.\nAt March 31, 2019, certain of our loans to B-Dry, LLC (\u201cB-Dry\u201d), Meridian Rack & Pinion, Inc. (\u201cMeridian\u201d), The Mountain, PSI Molded Plastics, Inc. (\u201cPSI Molded\u201d), and SOG were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of $68.3 million. At March 31, 2018, certain of our loans to two portfolio companies, Alloy Die Casting (\u201cADC\u201d) and Tread, were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of $15.6 million.\nDividend, success fee, and other income for the year ended March 31, 2019 increased 5.0% from the prior year. During the year ended March 31, 2019, dividend, success fee, and other income primarily consisted of $3.9 million of dividend income and $6.1 million of success fee income. During the year ended March 31, 2018, dividend, success fee, and other income primarily consisted of $4.2 million of dividend income and $5.3 million of success fee income.\nThe following table lists the fair value and investment income for our five largest portfolio company investments, at fair value, as of the end and during the respective fiscal years:\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of March 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nPortfolio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Investment\nIncome </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total\nInvestment\nIncome </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nth Degree, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> J.R.

The capital gains-based incentive fee was a result of the net impact of net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments during the respective periods. The income-based incentive fee decreased for the year ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year, as the increase in net assets, which drives the hurdle rate, more than offset the increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income during the respective periods.\nThe base management fee increased for the year ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year, as average total assets increased over the respective periods as a result of an increase in investments at fair value.\nThe base management fee, loan servicing fee, incentive fee, and their related non-contractual, unconditional, and irrevocable credits are computed quarterly, as described under \u201cTransactions with the Adviser\u201d in Note 4 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are summarized in the following table:\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average total assets subject to base management fee(A)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>637,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539,800 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multiplied by annual base management fee of 2.0%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Base management fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,796 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credits to fees from Adviser -

The effective interest rate on the Credit Facility, excluding the impact of deferred financing costs, during the year ended March 31, 2019 was 5.9%, as compared to 5.4% in the prior year. The weighted-average balance outstanding on the Credit Facility during the year ended March 31, 2019 was $97.9 million, as compared to $67.8 million in the prior year. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Line of Credit\u201d for further discussion of the Credit Facility. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Term Preferred Stock\u201d for further discussion of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.\nOther expenses increased 58.7% primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of $1.4 million largely driven by accrual status changes in the current year.\nRealized and Unrealized Gain (Loss), net of Taxes\nNet Realized Gain on Investments\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded net realized gains on investments of $68.6 million, primarily related to a $65.7 million realized gain from the exit of Cambridge, a $13.8 million realized gain from the exit of Drew Foam, a $13.0 million realized gain from the exit of Logo, and a $5.4 million realized gain from the exit of Star Seed, partially offset by a $10.0 million realized loss from the restructure of our debt investments in The Mountain, a $10.0 million realized loss from the restructure of our debt investments in SOG, a $7.7 million realized loss from the exit of our equity investment in CCE and a $3.6 million realized loss from the exit of NDLI. During the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a net realized gain on investments of $1.3 million, primarily related to a $1.0 million realized gain from the exit of Mitchell Rubber Products, Inc. (\u201cMitchell\u201d).\nTaxes on Deemed Distribution of Long-Term Capital Gains\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, we elected to retain $50.0 million of long-term capital gains and to treat them as deemed distributions to common stockholders. We incurred $10.5 million of federal taxes on behalf of common stockholders for the year ended March 31, 2019. In addition, we recorded a reserve for uncertain tax positions related to potential Virginia state tax exposure related to the deemed distribution of $3.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2019.

increased by 12.5% for the year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year. This increase was due to increases in both interest income and other income for the year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year.\nInterest income from our investments in debt securities increased 5.7% for the year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year. The level of interest income from investments is generally directly related to the principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio outstanding during the period multiplied by the weighted-average yield. The weighted-average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio during the year ended March 31, 2018, was $373.4 million, compared to $364.7 million for the prior year. This increase was primarily due to $47.2 million in new debt investments and $68.8 million in follow-on debt investments to existing portfolio companies originated after March 31, 2017, partially offset by the pay-off or restructure of $65.3 million of debt investments principally related to the exit, merger, or restructure of portfolio companies, and their respective impact on the weighted-average principal balance when considering the timing of new investments, pay-offs, mergers, restructures, and non-accruals, as applicable. The weighted-average yield on our interest-bearing investments, excluding cash and cash equivalents and receipts recorded as other income, was 13.1% and 12.7% for the year ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The weighted-average yield may vary from period to period, based on the current stated interest rate on interest-bearing investments.\nAt March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017, certain of our loans to two portfolio companies, ADC and Tread, were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of $15.6 million as of both periods.\nDividend, success fee, and other income for the year ended March 31, 2018 increased 66.8% from the prior year. During the year ended March 31, 2018, dividend, success fee, and other income primarily consisted of $4.2 million of dividend income and $5.3 million of success fee income. During the year ended March 31, 2017, dividend, success fee, and other income primarily consisted of $3.3 million of dividend income and $2.4 million of success fee income.\nThe following table lists the investment income and fair values for our five largest portfolio company investments, at fair value, as of the end and during the respective fiscal years:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of March 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nPortfolio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Investment\nIncome </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total\nInvestment\nIncome </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cambridge Sound Management, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nth Degree, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> J.R.

Additionally, in accordance with GAAP, we recorded a capital gains-based incentive fee of $4.4 million during the year ended March 31, 2018, which was not contractually due under the terms of the Advisory Agreement. The capital gains-based incentive fee was a result of the net impact of net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments during the respective periods. There was no capital gains-based incentive fee recorded or paid during the prior year.\nThe base management fee increased for the year ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, as average total assets increased over the period.\nThe base management fee, loan servicing fee, incentive fee, and their related non-contractual, unconditional, and irrevocable credits are computed quarterly, as described under \u201cTransactions with the Adviser\u201d in Note 4 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are summarized in the following table:\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average total assets subject to base management fee(A)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>496,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multiplied by annual base management fee of 2.0%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Base management fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,925 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credits to fees from Adviser - other(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,674 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,506 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net base management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,419 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan servicing fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,606 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credits to base management fee - loan servicing fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,277 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,606 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loan servicing fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incentive fee - income-based\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incentive fee - capital gains-based(C)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total incentive fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credits to fees from Adviser - other(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net total incentive fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>(A) </td> <td> Average total assets subject to the base management fee is defined in the Advisory Agreement as total assets, including investments made with proceeds of borrowings, less any uninvested cash or cash equivalents resulting from borrowings, valued at the end of the applicable quarters within the respective periods and adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>(B) </td> <td> Reflected as a line item on our accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>(C) </td> <td> The capital gains-based incentive fee is not yet contractually due under the terms of the Advisory Agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Interest and dividend expense increased 6.7% during the year ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher costs of borrowings under the Credit Facility. The effective interest rate on the Credit Facility, excluding the impact of deferred financing costs, during the year ended March 31, 2018 was 5.4%, as compared to 4.7% in the prior year. Dividends on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock increased $0.3 million in the current year, when the Series D Term Preferred Stock was outstanding for the entire year, as compared to the prior year, when the Series D Term Preferred Stock was newly issued and only outstanding for a portion of the period and the 7.125% Series A Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (our \u201cSeries A Term Preferred Stock\u201d or \u201cSeries A\u201d) was outstanding until September 2016.\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and discounts decreased 21.7% for the year ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the write-off of previously deferred costs in the prior year related to the Credit Facility's amendment in November 2016.\nRealized and Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nNet Realized Gain on Investments\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a net realized gain on investments of $1.3 million, primarily related to a $1.0 million realized gain from the exit of Mitchell, compared to net realized gains on investments of $15.6 million during the prior year period, primarily related to an $18.9 million realized gain from the exit of Acme Cryogenics, Inc. (\u201cAcme\u201d), a $5.9 million realized gain from the exit of Behrens Manufacturing, LLC (\u201cBehrens\u201d), and a $1.3 million realized gain related to an additional earn-out from Funko, LLC, which was exited during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, partially offset by a $10.2 million realized loss from the restructure of D.P.M.S., Inc. (\u201cDanco\u201d).\nNet Realized Loss on Other\nThere were no realized gains or losses on other during the year ended March 31, 2018. During the year ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a net realized loss on other of $0.3 million, of which $0.2 million related to the redemption of our Series A Term Preferred Stock in September 2016 and $0.1 million related to the expiration of our interest rate cap agreement in April 2016.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded net unrealized appreciation of investments of $37.9 million.

appreciation of investments of $6.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 were the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation related to our investment in Danco upon its restructure, an increase in the fair value of our investment in Mitchell based on its sale in April 2017, and increased performance and comparable multiples used to estimate the fair value of certain of our investments, which was partially offset by unrealized depreciation resulting from the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation related to the exit of our investments in Acme and Behrens and a decrease in performance of certain of our portfolio companies.\nAcross our entire investment portfolio, we recorded $13.9 million of net unrealized depreciation on our debt positions and $51.8 million of net unrealized appreciation on our equity holdings for the year ended March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, the fair value of our investment portfolio was greater than our cost basis by $14.3 million, as compared to March 31, 2017, when the fair value of our investment portfolio was less than our cost basis by $23.6 million, representing net unrealized appreciation of $37.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. Our entire portfolio was fair valued at 102.4% of cost as of March 31, 2018.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation on Other\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded net unrealized appreciation of other of $0.5 million related to changes in the fair value of the Credit Facility. During the year ended March 31, 2017, we recorded net unrealized appreciation on other of $0.1 million due to the reversal of previously recorded depreciation upon the expiration of our interest rate cap agreement in April 2016.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOperating Activities\nCash inflows from operating activities are primarily generated from cash collections of interest and other income from our portfolio companies, as well as from cash proceeds received from repayments of debt investments and from sales of equity investments. These cash collections are principally used to fund new investments, pay distributions to our common stockholders, make interest payments on the Credit Facility, make dividend payments on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, pay management and incentive fees to the Adviser, and for other operating expenses. We may also use cash inflows from operating activities to repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2019 was $93.6 million, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $29.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. This change was primarily due to higher net proceeds from the sale of investments, higher principal repayments of investments, and lower purchases of investments period over period. Purchases of investments totaled $91.9 million during the year ended March 31, 2019, compared to $98.5 million during the year ended March 31, 2018. Repayments and net proceeds from the sale of investments totaled $154.7 million during the year ended March 31, 2019, compared to $39.9 million during the year ended March 31, 2018.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2018 was $29.7 million, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $32.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2017. This change was primarily due to an increase in purchases of investments and lower repayments and net proceeds from the sale of investments. Purchases of investments totaled $98.5 million during the year ended March 31, 2018, compared to $62.4 million during the year ended March 31, 2017. Repayments and net proceeds from the sale of investments totaled $39.9 million during the year ended March 31, 2018, compared to $68.8 million during the year ended March 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had equity investments in, or loans to, 30 companies with an aggregate cost basis of $589.7 million. As of March 31, 2018, we had equity investments in, or loans to, 33 companies with an aggregate cost basis of $584.8 million.

redemption of our Series B Term Preferred Stock and Series C Term Preferred Stock of $81.7 million, $54.0 million of net repayments on the Credit Facility, and $30.5 million in distributions to common stockholders, partially offset by $72.1 million of net proceeds from the issuance of our Series E Term Preferred Stock and $1.8 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the at-the-market program.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2018 was $29.6 million, which consisted primarily of $37.3 million of net proceeds from the Credit Facility, $21.4 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in May 2017, including the partial exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option in June 2017, and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the ATM program in March 2018, partially offset by $28.9 million in distributions paid to common stockholders.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $34.1 million, which consisted primarily of $25.3 million of net repayments on the Credit Facility, $22.7 million in distributions paid to common stockholders, and the redemption of our Series A Term Preferred Stock in September 2016 of $40.0 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of our Series D Term Preferred Stock of $55.4 million in September 2016.\nDistributions and Dividends to Stockholders\nCommon Stock Distributions\nTo qualify to be taxed as a RIC and thus avoid corporate level federal income tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders, we are required, among other requirements, to distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis at least 90% of our Investment Company Taxable Income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction. Additionally, the Credit Facility generally restricts the amount of distributions to stockholders that we can pay out to be no greater than the sum of certain amounts, including our net investment income, plus net capital gains, plus amounts elected by the Company to be considered as having been paid during the prior fiscal year in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code. In accordance with these requirements, our Board of Directors declared, and we paid, monthly cash distributions of $0.067 per common share for each of the six months from April through September 2018, $0.068 per common share for each of the six months from October 2018 through March 2019, and supplemental distributions of $0.06 per common share for each of June 2018 and December 2018. In addition, in April 2019, our Board of Directors declared a deemed distribution of $1.52 per common share to stockholders of record as of March 29, 2019, a monthly distribution of $0.068 per common share for each of April, May, and June 2019, and a supplemental distribution of $0.09 per common share for June 2019. Our Board of Directors declared these distributions based on estimates of Investment Company Taxable Income and net long-term capital gains for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020.\nFor each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, Investment Company Taxable Income exceeded distributions declared and paid, and, in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code, we elected to treat $16.0 million and $8.4 million, respectively, of the first distributions paid to common stockholders in the respective subsequent fiscal year as having been paid in the respective prior year. In addition, for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, net capital gains exceeded distributions declared and paid, and, in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code, we elected to treat $13.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of the first distributions paid to common stockholders in the respective subsequent fiscal year as having been paid in the respective prior year. For the year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded a $16.1 million adjustment for estimated book-tax differences, which decreased Capital in excess of par value and increased Accumulated net realized gain in excess of distributions and (Overdistributed) underdistributed net investment income. For the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a $1.6 million adjustment for estimated book-tax differences, which decreased Capital in excess of par value and Accumulated net realized gain in excess of distributions and increased (Overdistributed) underdistributed net investment income.\nPreferred Stock Dividends\nOur Board of Directors declared and we paid monthly cash dividends of (i) $0.140625 per share to holders of our Series B Term Preferred Stock for each of the five months from April through August 2018 (prior to redemption); (ii) $0.135417 per share to holders of our Series C Term Preferred Stock for each of the five months from April through August 2018 (prior to redemption); and (iii) $0.13020833 per share to holders of our Series D Term Preferred Stock for each month during the year ended March 31, 2019. Our Board of Directors also declared and we paid a combined dividend for the pro-rated period from and including the issuance date, August 22, 2018, to and including August 31, 2018 and the full month of September 2018, which totaled $0.17265625 per share, to the holders of our Series E Term Preferred Stock. In addition, we paid $0.1328125 per share to holders of our Series E Term Preferred Stock for each of the six months from October 2018 through March 2019. In accordance with GAAP, we treat these monthly dividends as an operating expense.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan\nOur common stockholders who hold their shares through our transfer agent, Computershare, Inc. (\u201cComputershare\u201d), have the option to participate in a dividend reinvestment plan offered by Computershare, as the plan agent. This is an \u201copt in\u201d dividend reinvestment plan, meaning that common stockholders may elect to have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Common stockholders who do not make such election will receive their distributions in cash. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will be taxable to a common stockholder to the same extent, and with the same character, as if the common stockholder had received the distribution in cash. The common stockholder generally will have an adjusted basis in the additional common shares purchased through the plan equal to the dollar amount that would have been received if the U.S. stockholder had received the dividend or distribution in cash. The additional common shares will have a new holding period commencing on the day following the date on which the shares are credited to the common stockholder's account. Computershare purchases shares in the open market in connection with the obligations under the plan. The Computershare dividend reinvestment plan is not open to holders of our preferred stock.\nEquity\nRegistration Statement\nOn June 5, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-225447), which the SEC declared effective on July 13, 2018. The registration statement permits us to issue, through one or more transactions, up to an aggregate of $300.0 million in securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, subscription rights, debt securities, and warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock, or debt securities, including through concurrent, separate offerings of such securities. As of March 31, 2019, we had the ability to issue up to an additional $225.3 million in securities under the registration statement.\nCommon Stock\nIn February 2018, we entered into equity distribution agreements with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (\u201cCantor\u201d), Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc., and Wedbush Securities, Inc. (each a \u201cSales Agent\u201d), under which we have the ability to issue and sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, through the Sales Agents, up to an aggregate offering price of $35.0 million in what is commonly referred to as an \u201cat-the-market\u201d (\u201cATM\u201d) program. As of March 31, 2019, we had remaining capacity to sell up to an additional $31.8 million of common stock under the ATM program.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2018, we sold 168,824 shares of our common stock under the ATM program with Cantor at a weighted-average gross price of $11.09 per share and raised approximately $1.9 million of gross proceeds. The weighted-average net price per share, after deducting commissions and offering costs borne by us, was $10.87 and resulted in total net proceeds of approximately $1.8 million. Certain of these sales were below our then-current estimated NAV per share during the sales period, with a discount of $0.002 per share, when comparing the sales price per share, after deducting commissions, to the then-current estimated NAV per share; however, the net dilutive effect (after commissions and offering costs borne by us) of these sales was $0.00 per common share as a result of the small number of shares sold at a slight discount to NAV per share and resulting rounding. In aggregate, the sales during the three months ended June 30, 2018 were above our then-current estimated NAV per share.\nIn March 2018, we sold 127,412 shares of our common stock under the ATM program with Cantor at a weighted-average gross price of $10.45 per share and raised approximately $1.3 million of gross proceeds. The weighted-average net price per share, after deducting commissions and offering costs borne by us, was $10.24 and resulted in total net proceeds of approximately $1.3 million. These sales were below our then-current estimated NAV per share during the sales period, with such discounts ranging from $0.01 per share to $0.07 per share, when comparing the sales price per share, after deducting commissions, to the then-current estimated NAV per share; however, the net dilutive effect (after commissions and offering costs borne by us) of these sales was $0.00 per common share as a result of the small number of shares sold at a slight discount to NAV per share and resulting rounding.\nIn May 2017, we completed a public offering of 2.1 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.38 per share, which was below our then current NAV of $9.95 per share. Gross proceeds totaled $19.7 million and net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs borne by us, were $18.7 million, which were used to repay borrowings under the Credit Facility and for other general corporate purposes. In June 2017, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option and purchased an additional 155,265 shares at the public offering price of $9.38 per share and on the same terms and conditions solely to cover over-allotments, which resulted in gross proceeds of $1.5 million and net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs borne by us, of $1.4 million.\nWe anticipate issuing equity securities to obtain additional capital in the future. However, we cannot determine the timing or terms of any future equity issuances or whether we will be able to issue equity on terms favorable to us, or at all. When our common stock is trading at a price below NAV per share, the 1940 Act places regulatory constraints on our ability to obtain additional capital by issuing common stock. Generally, the 1940 Act provides that we may not issue and sell our common stock at a price below our NAV per common share, other than to our then existing common stockholders pursuant to a rights offering, without first obtaining approval from our stockholders and our independent directors and meeting other stated requirements. On March 29, 2019, the closing market price of our common stock was $11.60 per share, representing a 6.5% discount to our NAV per share of $12.40 as of March 31, 2019.\nAt our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on August 9, 2018, our stockholders approved a proposal authorizing us to issue and sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current NAV per common share for a period of one year from the date of such approval, provided that our Board of Directors makes certain determinations prior to any such sale. At our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, scheduled to take place in August 2019, we intend to ask our stockholders to vote in favor of a similar proposal so that it may be in effect for another year.\nTerm Preferred Stock\nIn August 2018, we completed a public offering of 2,990,000 shares of our Series E Term Preferred Stock at a public offering price of $25.00 per share. Gross proceeds totaled $74.8 million and net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs borne by us, were $72.1 million. Total underwriting discounts and offering costs related to this offering were $2.7 million, which have been recorded as discounts to the liquidation value on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and are being amortized over the period ending August 31, 2025, the mandatory redemption date.\nOur Series E Term Preferred Stock is not convertible into our common stock or any other security and provides for a fixed dividend equal to 6.375% per year, payable monthly (which equates to $4.8 million per year). We are required to redeem all shares of our outstanding Series E Term Preferred Stock on August 31, 2025, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, two other potential mandatory redemption triggers are as follows: (1) upon the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a change in control of us, we would be required to redeem all of our outstanding Series E Term Preferred Stock, and (2) if we fail to maintain asset coverage as required by Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act (which is currently 150%) and are unable to correct such failure within a specific amount of time, we are required to redeem a portion of our outstanding Series E Term Preferred Stock or otherwise cure the asset coverage redemption trigger (we may also redeem additional securities to cause asset coverage to be up to 200%). We may also voluntarily redeem all or a portion of our Series E Term Preferred Stock at our sole option at the redemption price at any time on or after August 31, 2020.\nIn August 2018, we used the proceeds from the issuance of our Series E Term Preferred Stock, along with borrowings under the Credit Facility, to voluntarily redeem all outstanding shares of our Series B Term Preferred Stock and Series C Term Preferred Stock, each of which had a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. In connection with the voluntary redemption of our Series B Term Preferred Stock and Series C Term Preferred Stock, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million, which was recorded in Realized loss on other in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and which was primarily comprised of unamortized deferred issuance costs at the time of redemption.\nPrior to its redemption in August 2018, our Series B Term Preferred Stock provided for a fixed dividend equal to 6.75% per year, payable monthly (which equated to $2.8 million per year). We were required to redeem all shares of our outstanding Series B Term Preferred Stock on December 31, 2021, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Our Series B Term Preferred Stock was not convertible into our common stock or any other security.\nPrior to its redemption in August 2018, our Series C Term Preferred Stock provided for a fixed dividend equal to 6.50% per year, payable monthly (which equated to $2.6 million per year). We were required to redeem all shares of our outstanding Series C Term Preferred Stock on May 31, 2022, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Our Series C Term Preferred Stock was not convertible into our common stock or any other security.\nIn September 2016, we completed a public offering of 2,300,000 shares of our Series D Term Preferred Stock at a public offering price of $25.00 per share. Gross proceeds totaled $57.5 million and net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs borne by us, were $55.4 million. Total underwriting discounts and offering costs related to this offering were $2.1 million, which have been recorded as discounts to the liquidation value on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and are being amortized over the period ending September 30, 2023, the mandatory redemption date.\nOur Series D Term Preferred Stock is not convertible into our common stock or any other security. Our Series D Term Preferred Stock provides for a fixed dividend equal to 6.25% per year, payable monthly (which equates to $3.6 million per year). We are required to redeem all shares of our outstanding Series D Term Preferred Stock on September 30, 2023, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, two other potential mandatory redemption triggers are as follows: (1) upon the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a change in control of us, we would be required to redeem all of our outstanding Series D Term Preferred Stock, and (2) if we fail to maintain asset coverage of at least 200% and are unable to correct such failure within a specific amount of time, we are required to redeem a portion of our outstanding Series D Term Preferred Stock or otherwise cure the asset coverage redemption trigger (and we may also redeem additional securities to cause the asset coverage to be 240%). We may also voluntarily redeem all or a portion of our Series D Term Preferred Stock at our sole option at the redemption price at any time on or after September 30, 2018.\nIn September 2016, we used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of our Series D Term Preferred Stock to voluntarily redeem all 1.6 million outstanding shares of our Series A Term Preferred Stock, which had a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. In connection with this voluntary redemption, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million, which has been recorded in Realized loss on other in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and which was primarily comprised of unamortized deferred issuance costs at the time of redemption.\nPrior to its redemption in September 2016, our Series A Term Preferred Stock provided for a fixed dividend equal to 7.125% per year, payable monthly (which equated to $2.9 million per year). We were required to redeem all of the outstanding Series A Term Preferred Stock on February 28, 2017, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share plus an amount equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends, if any, to the date of redemption. Our Series A Term Preferred Stock was not convertible into our common stock or any other security.\nEach series of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock has a preference over our common stock with respect to dividends, whereby no distributions are payable on our common stock unless the stated dividends, including any accrued and unpaid dividends, on the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock have been paid in full. The Series D Term Preferred Stock and Series E Term Preferred Stock are considered liabilities in accordance with GAAP and, as such, affect our asset coverage, exposing us to additional leverage risks. The asset coverage on our senior securities that are stock (our Series D Term Preferred Stock and Series E Term Preferred Stock) as of March 31, 2019 was 309.1%, calculated pursuant to Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act.\nRevolving Line of Credit\nOn August 22, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Business Investment, entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, originally entered into on April 30, 2013, with KeyBank National Association (\u201cKeyBank\u201d) as administrative agent, lead arranger, managing agent and lender, the Adviser, as servicer, and certain other lenders party thereto. The revolving period was extended to August 22, 2021, and if not renewed or extended by such date, all principal and interest will be due and payable on August 22, 2023 (two years after the revolving period end date). As of March 31, 2019, the Credit Facility provided two one-year extension options that may be exercised on or before the first and second anniversary of the August 22, 2018 amendment date, subject to approval by all lenders. Additionally, the Credit Facility commitment amount was increased from $165.0 million to $200.0 million and, subject to certain terms and conditions, can be expanded to a total facility amount of $300.0 million through additional commitments from existing or new lenders.\nAdvances under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 2.85% per annum until August 21, 2021, with the margin then increasing to 3.10% for the period from August 22, 2021 to August 21, 2022, and increasing further to 3.35% thereafter. The Credit Facility has an unused commitment fee on the daily unused commitment amount of 0.50% per annum if the average unused commitment amount for the period is less than or equal to 50% of the total commitment amount, 0.75% per annum if the average unused commitment amount for the period is greater than 50% but less than or equal to 65% of the total commitment amount, and 1.00% per annum if the average unused commitment amount for the period is greater than 65% of the total commitment amount. We incurred fees of approximately $1.6 million in connection with this amendment.\nInterest is payable monthly during the term of the Credit Facility. Available borrowings are subject to various constraints and applicable advance rates, which are generally based on the size, characteristics, and quality of the collateral pledged by Business Investment. The Credit Facility also requires that any interest and principal payments on pledged loans be remitted directly by the borrower into a lockbox account with KeyBank. KeyBank is also the trustee of the account and generally remits the collected funds to us once a month.\nAmong other things, the Credit Facility contains covenants that require Business Investment to maintain its status as a separate legal entity, prohibit certain significant corporate transactions (such as mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions) and restrict certain material changes to our credit and collection policies without the lenders' consent. The Credit Facility also generally seeks to restrict distributions to stockholders to the sum of (i) our net investment income, (ii) net capital gains, and (iii) amounts deemed by the Company to be considered as having been paid during the prior fiscal year in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code. Loans eligible to be pledged as collateral are subject to certain limitations, including, among other things, restrictions on geographic concentrations, industry concentrations, loan size, payment frequency and status, average life, portfolio company leverage, and lien property.\nThe Credit Facility also requires Business Investment to comply with other financial and operational covenants, which obligate Business Investment to, among other things, maintain certain financial ratios, including asset and interest coverage and a minimum number of obligors required in the borrowing base. Additionally, the Credit Facility contains a performance guaranty that requires the Company to maintain (i) a minimum net worth (defined in the Credit Facility to include our mandatory redeemable term preferred stock) of the greater of $210.0 million or $210.0 million plus 50% of all equity and subordinated debt raised minus 50% of any equity or subordinated debt redeemed or retired after November 16, 2016, which equated to $218.7 million as of March 31, 2019, (ii) asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness of at least 150% (or such percentage as may be set forth in Section 18 of the 1940 Act, as modified by Section 61 of the 1940 Act), and (iii) our status as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code. As of March 31, 2019, and as defined in the performance guaranty of the Credit Facility, we had a net worth of $533.9 million, asset coverage on our senior securities representing indebtedness of 997.6%, calculated in accordance with the requirements of Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, and an active status as a BDC and RIC. As of March 31, 2019, we had availability, after adjustments for various constraints based on collateral quality, of $137.5 million under the Credit Facility and were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.\nIn July 2013, pursuant to the terms of the then effective revolving line of credit, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with KeyBank effective October 2013 for a notional amount of $45.0 million. The interest rate cap agreement expired in April 2016. Prior to its expiration in April 2016, the agreement effectively limited the interest rate on a portion of our borrowings under the then effective revolving line of credit. We incurred a premium fee of $75 in conjunction with this agreement, which was recorded in Net realized loss on other on our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended March 31, 2017.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nUnlike PIK income, we generally do not recognize success fees as income until payment has been received. Due to the contingent nature of success fees, there are no guarantees that we will be able to collect any or all of these success fees or know the timing of any such collections. As a result, as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, we had unrecognized, contractual off-balance sheet success fee receivables of $30.1 million and $28.3 million (or approximately $0.92 and $0.87 per common share), respectively, on our debt investments. Consistent with GAAP, we have not recognized success fee receivables and related income in our Consolidated Financial Statements until earned.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe have line of credit commitments to certain of our portfolio companies that have not been fully drawn. Since these line of credit commitments have expiration dates and we expect many will never be fully drawn, the total line of credit commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We estimate the fair value of the combined unused line of credit commitments as of March 31, 2019 to be immaterial.\nAs of March 31, 2019, we have also extended a guaranty on behalf of one of our portfolio companies, CCE, whereby we have guaranteed $1.0 million of obligations of CCE. As of March 31, 2019, we have not been required to make payments on this or any previous guaranties, and we consider the credit risks to be remote and the fair value of this guaranty to be immaterial.\nThe following table shows our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2019, at cost:\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations(A)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less\nthan 1\nYear </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More\nthan 5\nYears </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured borrowing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments on obligations(C)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,751 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,501 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>(A) </td> <td> Excludes unused line of credit commitments and guaranties to our portfolio companies in the aggregate principal amount of $2.3 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>(B) </td> <td> Principal balance of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, based on the maturity date following the current contractual revolving period end date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>(C) </td> <td> Includes interest payments due on the Credit Facility and secured borrowing and dividend obligations on each series of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.

Dividend obligations on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock assume quarterly declarations and monthly dividend payments through the date of mandatory redemption of each series.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified our investment valuation policy (which has been approved by our Board of Directors) as our most critical accounting policy, which is described in Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Additionally, refer to Note 3 - Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding fair value measurements and our application of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d We have also identified our revenue recognition policy as a critical accounting policy, which is described in Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nInvestment Valuation\nCredit Monitoring and Risk Rating\nThe Adviser monitors a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance and, in some instances, are used as inputs in our valuation techniques. Generally, we, through the Adviser, participate in periodic board meetings of our portfolio companies in which we hold board seats and also require them to provide annual audited and monthly unaudited financial statements. Using these statements or comparable information and board discussions, the Adviser calculates and evaluates certain credit statistics.\nThe Adviser risk rates all of our investments in debt securities. The Adviser does not risk rate equity securities. For loans that have been rated by a SEC-registered Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (\u201cNRSRO\u201d), the Adviser generally uses the average of two corporate level NRSRO's risk ratings for such security. For all other debt securities, the Adviser uses a proprietary risk rating system. While the Adviser seeks to mirror the NRSRO systems, we cannot provide any assurance that the Adviser's risk rating system will provide the same risk rating as an NRSRO for these securities. The Adviser's risk rating system is used to estimate the probability of default on debt securities and the expected loss, if there is a default. The Adviser's risk rating system uses a scale of 0 to >10, with >10 being the lowest probability of default. It is the Adviser's understanding that most debt securities of Lower Middle Market companies do not exceed the grade of BBB on an NRSRO scale, so there would be no debt securities in the Lower Middle Market that would meet the definition of AAA, AA or A. Therefore, the Adviser's scale begins with the designation >10 as the best risk rating which may be equivalent to a BBB from an NRSRO; however, no assurance can be given that a >10 on the Adviser's scale is equal to a BBB or Baa2 on an NRSRO scale. The Adviser's risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold.\nThe following table reflects risk ratings for all loans in our portfolio as of March 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of March 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rating\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Highest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lowest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Tax Status\nWe intend to continue to maintain our qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a RIC, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to our stockholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must maintain our status as a BDC and meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to qualify to be taxed as a RIC, we must distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our Investment Company Taxable Income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction. Our policy generally is to make distributions to our stockholders in an amount up to 100% of Investment Company Taxable Income. We may retain some or all of our net long-term capital gains, if any, and designate them as deemed distributions, or distribute such gains to stockholders in cash. See \u201cBusiness - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d and \u201c - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Distributions and Dividends to Stockholders.\u201d\nIn an effort to limit federal excise taxes, we have to distribute to stockholders, during each calendar year, an amount close to the sum of: (1) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our net capital gains (both long-term and short-term), if any, for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding period (to the extent that income tax was not imposed on such amounts), less certain reductions, as applicable. Under the RIC Modernization Act, we are permitted to carryforward any capital losses that we may incur for an unlimited period, and such capital loss carryforwards will retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses. Our capital loss carryforward balance was $0 as of both March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. Historical financial condition and results of operations and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of financial condition, results of operations or percentage relationships for any future periods. Except per share amounts, dollar amounts included herein are in thousands unless otherwise indicated.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe were incorporated under the General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware on February 18, 2005. On June 22, 2005, we completed our initial public offering and commenced operations. We operate as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company and have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to continue to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes and obtain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must meet certain requirements, including certain minimum distribution requirements.\nWe were established for the purpose of investing in debt and equity securities of established private businesses operating in the U.S. Our investment objectives are to: (i) achieve and grow current income by investing in debt securities of established businesses that we believe will provide stable earnings and cash flow to pay expenses, make principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to stockholders that grow over time; and (ii) provide our stockholders with long-term capital appreciation in the value of our assets by investing in equity securities of established businesses, generally, in combination with the aforementioned debt securities, that we believe can grow over time to permit us to sell our equity investments for capital gains. To achieve our investment objectives, our investment strategy is to invest in several categories of debt and equity securities, with individual investments generally totaling up to $30 million, although investment size may vary, depending upon our total assets or available capital at the time of investment. We expect that our investment portfolio over time will consist of approximately 75% in debt securities and 25% in equity securities, at cost. As of March 31, 2019, our investment portfolio was made up of 75.1% in debt securities and 24.9% in equity securities, at cost.\nWe focus on investing in Lower Middle Market businesses in the U.S. that meet certain criteria, including the following: the sustainability of the business' free cash flow and its ability to grow it over time, adequate assets for loan collateral, experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the portfolio company, reasonable capitalization of the portfolio company, including an ample equity contribution or cushion based on prevailing enterprise valuation multiples, and the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position, if any. We anticipate that liquidity in our equity position will be achieved through a merger or acquisition of the portfolio company, a public offering of the portfolio company's stock or, to a lesser extent, by exercising our right to require the portfolio company to repurchase our warrants, as applicable, though there can be no assurance that we will always have these rights. We invest in portfolio companies that need funds for growth capital, to finance acquisitions, including management buyouts, or to recapitalize or, to a lesser extent, refinance their existing debt facilities. We seek to avoid investing in high-risk, early-stage enterprises.\nWe invest by ourselves or jointly with other funds and/or management of the portfolio company, depending on the opportunity, and have opportunistically made several co-investments with our affiliate Gladstone Capital pursuant to the Co-Investment Order. We believe the Co-Investment Order has enhanced and will continue to enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategies. If we are participating in an investment with one or more co-investors, whether or not an affiliate of ours, our investment is likely to be smaller than if we were investing alone.\nBusiness\nPortfolio Activity\nWhile the business environment remains competitive, we continue to see new investment opportunities consistent with our investment strategy of providing a combination of debt and equity in support of management and independent sponsor-led buyouts of Lower Middle Market companies in the U.S. During the year ended March 31, 2019, we exited five portfolio companies with a combined fair value prior to their exits of $131.4 million, and invested $57.8 million in two new portfolio companies, resulting in a net reduction of three companies in our portfolio, which was comprised of 30 companies as of March 31, 2019. From our initial public offering in June 2005 through March 31, 2019, we made investments in 49 companies, excluding investments in syndicated loans, for a total of approximately $1 billion, before giving effect to principal repayments and divestitures.\nThe majority of the debt securities in our portfolio have a success fee component, which enhances the yield on our debt investments. Unlike PIK income, we generally do not recognize success fees as income until payment has been received. Due to the contingent nature of success fees, there are no guarantees that we will be able to collect any or all of these success fees or know the timing of any such collections. As a result, as of March 31, 2019, we had unrecognized, contractual success fees of $30.1 million, or $0.92 per common share. Consistent with GAAP, we generally have not recognized success fee receivables and related income in our Consolidated Financial Statements until earned.\nFrom inception through March 31, 2019, we completed sales of 16 portfolio companies that we acquired under our buyout strategy (which excludes investments in syndicated loans). In the aggregate, these sales have generated $185.9 million in net realized gains and $23.4 million in other income upon exit, for a total increase to our net assets of $209.3 million. We believe, in aggregate, these transactions were equity-oriented investment successes and exemplify our investment strategy of striving to achieve returns through current income on the debt portion of our investments and capital gains from the equity portion. The 16 liquidity events have offset any realized losses since inception, which were primarily incurred during the recession in connection with the sale of performing syndicated loans at a realized loss to pay off a former lender. These successful exits, in part, enabled us to increase the monthly distribution by 70.0% from March 2011 through March 31, 2019, and allowed us to declare and pay a $0.03 per common share supplemental distribution in fiscal year 2012, a $0.05 per common share supplemental distribution in November 2013, a $0.05 per common share supplemental distribution in December 2014, and a $0.06 per common share supplemental distribution in each of June 2017, December 2017, June 2018, and December 2018.\nCapital Raising Efforts\nWe have been able to meet our capital needs through extensions of and increases to the Credit Facility and by accessing the capital markets in the form of public offerings of common and preferred stock. We have successfully extended the Credit Facility's revolving period multiple times, most recently to August 2021, and currently have a total commitment amount of $200.0 million (with a potential total commitment of $300.0 million through additional commitments of new or existing lenders). During the year ended March 31, 2019, we sold 168,824 shares of our common stock under our at-the-market program for gross proceeds of approximately $1.9 million. During the year ended March 31, 2018, we sold 127,412 shares of our common stock under our at-the-market program for gross proceeds of approximately $1.3 million. Additionally, we issued approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $21.2 million in May 2017, inclusive of the June 2017 over-allotment, and approximately 3.0 million shares of our Series E Term Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $74.8 million in August 2018. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Line of Credit\u201d for further discussion of the Credit Facility and to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Common Stock\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Term Preferred Stock\u201d for further discussion of our common stock, including our at-the-market program, and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.\nAlthough we have been able to access the capital markets historically, market conditions may continue to affect the trading price of our common stock and thus our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of common equity. On March 31, 2019, the closing market price of our common stock was $11.60 per share, which represented a 6.5% discount to our March 31, 2019 NAV per share of $12.40. When our common stock trades below NAV, our ability to issue additional equity is constrained by provisions of the 1940 Act, which generally prohibits the issuance and sale of our common stock at an issuance price below the then current NAV per share without stockholder approval, other than through sales to our then existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering.\nAt our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on August 9, 2018, our stockholders approved a proposal authorizing us to issue and sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current NAV per share, subject to certain limitations, including that the number of common shares issued and sold pursuant to such authority does not exceed 25.0% of our then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale, provided that our Board of Directors makes certain determinations prior to any such sale. This August 2018 stockholder authorization is in effect for one year from the date of stockholder approval. We sought and obtained stockholder approval concerning similar proposals at each Annual Meeting of Stockholders since 2008, and with our Board of Directors' subsequent approval, we issued shares of our common stock in three offerings at a price below the then current NAV per share, once in May 2017, once in March 2015, and once in October 2012. Certain sales under the at-the-market program in March 2018 and April 2018 were also below the then current estimated NAV per share. The resulting proceeds, in part, have allowed us to (i) grow our portfolio by making new investments, (ii) generate additional income through these new investments, (iii) ensure continued compliance with regulatory tests and (iv) increase our debt capital while still complying with our applicable debt-to-equity ratios. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Common Stock\u201d for further discussion of our common stock.\nRegulatory Compliance\nOur ability to seek external debt financing, to the extent that it is available under current market conditions, is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the 1940 Act, which require us to have asset coverage (as defined in Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, as amended) of at least 150% on each of our senior securities representing indebtedness and our senior securities that are stock (such as our two series of term preferred stock).\nOn April 10, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a \u201crequired majority\u201d (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) thereof, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA. As a result, the Company's asset coverage requirements for senior securities changed from 200% to 150% effective April 10, 2019, one year after the date of the Board of Directors' approval. Under the 200% asset coverage standard prior to April 10, 2019, we were able to borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $1.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Starting from April 10, 2019, under the 150% asset coverage standard, we may borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $2.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Notwithstanding the modified asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act described above, we are separately subject to a minimum asset coverage requirement of 200% with respect to our Series D Term Preferred Stock.\nAs of March 31, 2019, our asset coverage ratio on our senior securities representing indebtedness was 997.6% and our asset coverage on our senior securities that are stock (our Series D Term Preferred Stock and our Series E Term Preferred Stock) was 309.1%.\nInvestment Highlights\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, and inclusive of non-cash transactions, we invested $57.8 million in two new portfolio companies, received $175.8 million in proceeds from repayments and sales, and extended $54.3 million of follow-on investments to existing portfolio companies through revolver draws, term loans, and additions to equity, as applicable.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the following significant transactions occurred:\n \u2022 In April 2018, we invested $29.2 million in Bassett Creek Restoration, Inc. (d/b/a J.R. Johnson, LLC) (\u201cBassett Creek\u201d) through a combination of secured first lien debt and preferred equity. Bassett Creek, headquartered in Portland, Oregon, is a leading provider of commercial restoration and renovation services to the Oregon and Southwest Washington region. \n \u2022 In June 2018, we sold our investment in Drew Foam Companies, Inc. (\u201cDrew Foam\u201d), which resulted in dividend and success fee income of $0.2 million and a realized gain of $13.8 million. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of $27.3 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $9.9 million at par. \n \u2022 In July 2018, we exited our investment in NDLI, Inc. (\u201cNDLI\u201d) and recorded a realized loss of $3.6 million. \n \u2022 In October 2018, we invested an additional $15.0 million of secured first lien debt into J.R. Hobbs, which together with our existing $21.0 million secured first lien term loan resulted in a new $36.0 million secured first lien term loan due in October 2023. \n \u2022 In October 2018, we exited our equity investment in Country Club Enterprises, LLC (\u201cCCE\u201d), which resulted in a realized loss of $7.7 million. As part of this transaction, we received success fee income of $1.0 million, reduced our existing guaranty to $1.0 million, and amended our existing $4.0 million secured second lien term loan to have a stated interest rate of LIBOR + 8.0% and mature in February 2022. \n \u2022 In November 2018, we sold our investment in Logo Sportswear, Inc. (\u201cLogo\u201d), which resulted in success fee income of $0.2 million and a realized gain of $13.0 million. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of $22.7 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $9.2 million at par. \n \u2022 In November 2018, we invested $28.6 million in Educators Resource, Inc. (\u201cEducators Resource\u201d) through a combination of secured first lien debt and preferred equity. Educators Resource, headquartered in Semmes, Alabama, is a leading e-commerce wholesale distributor of supplemental teaching materials. \n \u2022 In December 2018, we sold our investment in Cambridge Sound Management, Inc. (\u201cCambridge\u201d), which resulted in success fee income of $0.4 million, dividend income of $0.1 million, and a realized gain of $65.7 million. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of $86.8 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $16.0 million at par. \n \u2022 In December 2018, we sold our investment in Star Seed, Inc. (\u201cStar Seed\u201d), which resulted in success fee income of $0.5 million and a realized gain of $5.4 million. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of $12.5 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $5.0 million at par. \n \u2022 In January 2019, we restructured two of our first lien term loans to SOG Specialty Knives & Tools, LLC (\u201cSOG\u201d) with a total cost basis of $18.4 million into a new $8.4 million first lien term loan, which resulted in a realized loss of $10.0 million. The new term loan has a stated interest rate of LIBOR + 4.0% and matures in August 2022. In addition, we invested $1.0 million of preferred equity in SOG. \n \u2022 In March 2019, we restructured our existing second lien term loans and delayed draw term loan to The Mountain Corporation (\u201cThe Mountain\u201d) with a total cost basis of $21.7 million into a new $11.7 million second lien term loan, which resulted in a realized loss of $10.0 million. The new term loan has a stated interest rate of LIBOR + 4.0% and matures in April 2024. In addition, we extended a new $2.9 million first lien line of credit to The Mountain of which $2.5 million was outstanding as of March 31, 2019. The line of credit has a stated interest rate of LIBOR + 5.0% and matures in April 2020.  The following significant investment activity occurred subsequent to March 31, 2019. Also refer to Note 15 - Subsequent Events in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n \u2022 In April 2019, we sold our investment in Tread Corporation (\u201cTread\u201d), which had a cost basis and fair value of $7.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2019. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of $4.4 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $3.2 million at par. \n \u2022 In April 2019, we sold our investment in Jackrabbit, Inc., which had a cost basis and fair value of $14.7 million and $19.2 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2019. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of $19.7 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $11.0 million at par. \n \u2022 In April and May 2019, we extended a line of credit to J.R. Hobbs with a total commitment amount of $10.0 million at a stated interest rate of LIBOR + 10.25%, which matures in October 2019.  Recent Developments\nDistributions and Dividends\nIn April 2019, our Board of Directors declared the following monthly and supplemental cash distributions to common stockholders and monthly dividends to holders of our Series D Term Preferred Stock and Series E Term Preferred Stock:\n\n (A) Represents a supplemental distribution to common stockholders. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2019 to the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2018\n NM = Not Meaningful\nInvestment Income\nTotal investment income increased by 2.2% for the year ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year. This increase was due to increases in both interest income and dividend, success fee, and other income.\nInterest income from our investments in debt securities increased 1.7% for the year ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year. Generally, the level of interest income from investments is directly related to the principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio outstanding during the period multiplied by the weighted-average yield. The weighted-average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio during the year ended March 31, 2019 was $380.2 million, compared to $373.4 million during the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the origination of $44.3 million of new debt investments and $51.7 million of follow-on debt investments to existing portfolio companies and $16.5 million of loans placed back on accrual status after March 31, 2018, partially offset by the pay-off or restructure of $65.3 million of debt investments and $68.3 million of loans placed on non-accrual status, and their respective impact on the weighted-average principal balance when considering the timing of new investments, pay-offs, restructures, and accrual status changes, as applicable. The weighted-average yield on our interest-bearing investments, excluding cash and cash equivalents and receipts recorded as other income, was 13.0% and 13.1% for the year ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted-average yield may vary from period to period, based on the current stated interest rate on interest-bearing investments.\nAt March 31, 2019, certain of our loans to B-Dry, LLC (\u201cB-Dry\u201d), Meridian Rack & Pinion, Inc. (\u201cMeridian\u201d), The Mountain, PSI Molded Plastics, Inc. (\u201cPSI Molded\u201d), and SOG were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of $68.3 million. At March 31, 2018, certain of our loans to two portfolio companies, Alloy Die Casting (\u201cADC\u201d) and Tread, were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of $15.6 million.\nDividend, success fee, and other income for the year ended March 31, 2019 increased 5.0% from the prior year. During the year ended March 31, 2019, dividend, success fee, and other income primarily consisted of $3.9 million of dividend income and $6.1 million of success fee income. During the year ended March 31, 2018, dividend, success fee, and other income primarily consisted of $4.2 million of dividend income and $5.3 million of success fee income.\nThe following table lists the fair value and investment income for our five largest portfolio company investments, at fair value, as of the end and during the respective fiscal years:\n\n (A) Investment exited subsequent to March 31, 2018. \n (B) New investment during the applicable year. \nExpenses\nTotal expenses, net of any non-contractual, unconditional, and irrevocable credits from the Adviser, increased 43.2% for the year ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the capital gains-based incentive fee, the base management fee, interest and dividend expense, and other expenses.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we recorded a capital gains-based incentive fee of $17.8 million and $4.4 million during the year ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, which were not contractually due under the terms of the Advisory Agreement. The capital gains-based incentive fee was a result of the net impact of net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments during the respective periods. The income-based incentive fee decreased for the year ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year, as the increase in net assets, which drives the hurdle rate, more than offset the increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income during the respective periods.\nThe base management fee increased for the year ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year, as average total assets increased over the respective periods as a result of an increase in investments at fair value.\nThe base management fee, loan servicing fee, incentive fee, and their related non-contractual, unconditional, and irrevocable credits are computed quarterly, as described under \u201cTransactions with the Adviser\u201d in Note 4 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are summarized in the following table:\n\n (A) Average total assets subject to the base management fee is defined in the Advisory Agreement as total assets, including investments made with proceeds of borrowings, less any uninvested cash or cash equivalents resulting from borrowings, valued at the end of the applicable quarters within the respective periods and adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the periods. \n (B) Reflected as a line item on our accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n (C) The capital gains-based incentive fee is not yet contractually due under the terms of the Advisory Agreement.  Interest and dividend expense increased 14.2% during the year ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in interest expense as a result of a higher weighted-average balance outstanding on the Credit Facility and slightly higher costs of borrowings under the Credit Facility as the increase in LIBOR more than offset the reduced interest rate margin after the amendment of the Credit Facility in August 2018. The effective interest rate on the Credit Facility, excluding the impact of deferred financing costs, during the year ended March 31, 2019 was 5.9%, as compared to 5.4% in the prior year. The weighted-average balance outstanding on the Credit Facility during the year ended March 31, 2019 was $97.9 million, as compared to $67.8 million in the prior year. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Line of Credit\u201d for further discussion of the Credit Facility. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Term Preferred Stock\u201d for further discussion of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.\nOther expenses increased 58.7% primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of $1.4 million largely driven by accrual status changes in the current year.\nRealized and Unrealized Gain (Loss), net of Taxes\nNet Realized Gain on Investments\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded net realized gains on investments of $68.6 million, primarily related to a $65.7 million realized gain from the exit of Cambridge, a $13.8 million realized gain from the exit of Drew Foam, a $13.0 million realized gain from the exit of Logo, and a $5.4 million realized gain from the exit of Star Seed, partially offset by a $10.0 million realized loss from the restructure of our debt investments in The Mountain, a $10.0 million realized loss from the restructure of our debt investments in SOG, a $7.7 million realized loss from the exit of our equity investment in CCE and a $3.6 million realized loss from the exit of NDLI. During the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a net realized gain on investments of $1.3 million, primarily related to a $1.0 million realized gain from the exit of Mitchell Rubber Products, Inc. (\u201cMitchell\u201d).\nTaxes on Deemed Distribution of Long-Term Capital Gains\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, we elected to retain $50.0 million of long-term capital gains and to treat them as deemed distributions to common stockholders. We incurred $10.5 million of federal taxes on behalf of common stockholders for the year ended March 31, 2019. In addition, we recorded a reserve for uncertain tax positions related to potential Virginia state tax exposure related to the deemed distribution of $3.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. Refer to Note 9 - Distributions to Common Stockholders in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNet Realized Loss on Other\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded a net realized loss on other of $1.7 million which primarily related to unamortized deferred issuance costs written off upon the redemption of our 6.750% Series B Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (our \u201cSeries B Term Preferred Stock\u201d) and 6.500% Series C Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (our \u201cSeries C Term Preferred Stock\u201d) in August 2018. There were no realized gains or losses on other during the year ended March 31, 2018.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded net unrealized appreciation of investments of $20.2 million. The realized gains (losses) and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) across our investments for the year ended March 31, 2019 were as follows:\n The primary drivers of net unrealized appreciation of investments of $20.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 were increased performance of certain of our portfolio companies, an increase in comparable multiples used to estimate the fair value of certain of our portfolio companies, and the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation of certain investments upon their exit or restructure, partially offset by the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation upon the exit of certain of our investments and a decline in performance of certain of our other portfolio companies.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded net unrealized appreciation of investments of $37.9 million. The realized gains (losses) and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) across our investments for the year ended March 31, 2018 were as follows:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. Historical financial condition and results of operations and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of financial condition, results of operations or percentage relationships for any future periods. Except per share amounts, dollar amounts included herein are in thousands unless otherwise indicated.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe were incorporated under the General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware on February 18, 2005. On June 22, 2005, we completed our initial public offering and commenced operations. We operate as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company and have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to continue to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes and obtain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must meet certain requirements, including certain minimum distribution requirements.\nWe were established for the purpose of investing in debt and equity securities of established private businesses operating in the U.S. Our investment objectives are to: (i) achieve and grow current income by investing in debt securities of established businesses that we believe will provide stable earnings and cash flow to pay expenses, make principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to stockholders that grow over time; and (ii) provide our stockholders with long-term capital appreciation in the value of our assets by investing in equity securities of established businesses, generally, in combination with the aforementioned debt securities, that we believe can grow over time to permit us to sell our equity investments for capital gains. To achieve our investment objectives, our investment strategy is to invest in several categories of debt and equity securities, with individual investments generally totaling up to $30 million, although investment size may vary, depending upon our total assets or available capital at the time of investment. We expect that our investment portfolio over time will consist of approximately 75% in debt securities and 25% in equity securities, at cost. As of March 31, 2019, our investment portfolio was made up of 75.1% in debt securities and 24.9% in equity securities, at cost.\nWe focus on investing in Lower Middle Market businesses in the U.S. that meet certain criteria, including the following: the sustainability of the business' free cash flow and its ability to grow it over time, adequate assets for loan collateral, experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the portfolio company, reasonable capitalization of the portfolio company, including an ample equity contribution or cushion based on prevailing enterprise valuation multiples, and the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position, if any. We anticipate that liquidity in our equity position will be achieved through a merger or acquisition of the portfolio company, a public offering of the portfolio company's stock or, to a lesser extent, by exercising our right to require the portfolio company to repurchase our warrants, as applicable, though there can be no assurance that we will always have these rights. We invest in portfolio companies that need funds for growth capital, to finance acquisitions, including management buyouts, or to recapitalize or, to a lesser extent, refinance their existing debt facilities. We seek to avoid investing in high-risk, early-stage enterprises.\nWe invest by ourselves or jointly with other funds and/or management of the portfolio company, depending on the opportunity, and have opportunistically made several co-investments with our affiliate Gladstone Capital pursuant to the Co-Investment Order. We believe the Co-Investment Order has enhanced and will continue to enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategies. If we are participating in an investment with one or more co-investors, whether or not an affiliate of ours, our investment is likely to be smaller than if we were investing alone.\nBusiness\nPortfolio Activity\nWhile the business environment remains competitive, we continue to see new investment opportunities consistent with our investment strategy of providing a combination of debt and equity in support of management and independent sponsor-led buyouts of Lower Middle Market companies in the U.S. During the year ended March 31, 2019, we exited five portfolio companies with a combined fair value prior to their exits of $131.4 million, and invested $57.8 million in two new portfolio companies, resulting in a net reduction of three companies in our portfolio, which was comprised of 30 companies as of March 31, 2019. From our initial public offering in June 2005 through March 31, 2019, we made investments in 49 companies, excluding investments in syndicated loans, for a total of approximately $1 billion, before giving effect to principal repayments and divestitures.\nThe majority of the debt securities in our portfolio have a success fee component, which enhances the yield on our debt investments. Unlike PIK income, we generally do not recognize success fees as income until payment has been received. Due to the contingent nature of success fees, there are no guarantees that we will be able to collect any or all of these success fees or know the timing of any such collections. As a result, as of March 31, 2019, we had unrecognized, contractual success fees of $30.1 million, or $0.92 per common share. Consistent with GAAP, we generally have not recognized success fee receivables and related income in our Consolidated Financial Statements until earned.\nFrom inception through March 31, 2019, we completed sales of 16 portfolio companies that we acquired under our buyout strategy (which excludes investments in syndicated loans). In the aggregate, these sales have generated $185.9 million in net realized gains and $23.4 million in other income upon exit, for a total increase to our net assets of $209.3 million. We believe, in aggregate, these transactions were equity-oriented investment successes and exemplify our investment strategy of striving to achieve returns through current income on the debt portion of our investments and capital gains from the equity portion. The 16 liquidity events have offset any realized losses since inception, which were primarily incurred during the recession in connection with the sale of performing syndicated loans at a realized loss to pay off a former lender. These successful exits, in part, enabled us to increase the monthly distribution by 70.0% from March 2011 through March 31, 2019, and allowed us to declare and pay a $0.03 per common share supplemental distribution in fiscal year 2012, a $0.05 per common share supplemental distribution in November 2013, a $0.05 per common share supplemental distribution in December 2014, and a $0.06 per common share supplemental distribution in each of June 2017, December 2017, June 2018, and December 2018.\nCapital Raising Efforts\nWe have been able to meet our capital needs through extensions of and increases to the Credit Facility and by accessing the capital markets in the form of public offerings of common and preferred stock. We have successfully extended the Credit Facility's revolving period multiple times, most recently to August 2021, and currently have a total commitment amount of $200.0 million (with a potential total commitment of $300.0 million through additional commitments of new or existing lenders). During the year ended March 31, 2019, we sold 168,824 shares of our common stock under our at-the-market program for gross proceeds of approximately $1.9 million. During the year ended March 31, 2018, we sold 127,412 shares of our common stock under our at-the-market program for gross proceeds of approximately $1.3 million. Additionally, we issued approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $21.2 million in May 2017, inclusive of the June 2017 over-allotment, and approximately 3.0 million shares of our Series E Term Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $74.8 million in August 2018. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Line of Credit\u201d for further discussion of the Credit Facility and to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Common Stock\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Term Preferred Stock\u201d for further discussion of our common stock, including our at-the-market program, and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.\nAlthough we have been able to access the capital markets historically, market conditions may continue to affect the trading price of our common stock and thus our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of common equity. On March 31, 2019, the closing market price of our common stock was $11.60 per share, which represented a 6.5% discount to our March 31, 2019 NAV per share of $12.40. When our common stock trades below NAV, our ability to issue additional equity is constrained by provisions of the 1940 Act, which generally prohibits the issuance and sale of our common stock at an issuance price below the then current NAV per share without stockholder approval, other than through sales to our then existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering.\nAt our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on August 9, 2018, our stockholders approved a proposal authorizing us to issue and sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current NAV per share, subject to certain limitations, including that the number of common shares issued and sold pursuant to such authority does not exceed 25.0% of our then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale, provided that our Board of Directors makes certain determinations prior to any such sale. This August 2018 stockholder authorization is in effect for one year from the date of stockholder approval. We sought and obtained stockholder approval concerning similar proposals at each Annual Meeting of Stockholders since 2008, and with our Board of Directors' subsequent approval, we issued shares of our common stock in three offerings at a price below the then current NAV per share, once in May 2017, once in March 2015, and once in October 2012. Certain sales under the at-the-market program in March 2018 and April 2018 were also below the then current estimated NAV per share. The resulting proceeds, in part, have allowed us to (i) grow our portfolio by making new investments, (ii) generate additional income through these new investments, (iii) ensure continued compliance with regulatory tests and (iv) increase our debt capital while still complying with our applicable debt-to-equity ratios. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Common Stock\u201d for further discussion of our common stock.\nRegulatory Compliance\nOur ability to seek external debt financing, to the extent that it is available under current market conditions, is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the 1940 Act, which require us to have asset coverage (as defined in Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, as amended) of at least 150% on each of our senior securities representing indebtedness and our senior securities that are stock (such as our two series of term preferred stock).\nOn April 10, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a \u201crequired majority\u201d (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) thereof, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA. As a result, the Company's asset coverage requirements for senior securities changed from 200% to 150% effective April 10, 2019, one year after the date of the Board of Directors' approval. Under the 200% asset coverage standard prior to April 10, 2019, we were able to borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $1.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Starting from April 10, 2019, under the 150% asset coverage standard, we may borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $2.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Notwithstanding the modified asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act described above, we are separately subject to a minimum asset coverage requirement of 200% with respect to our Series D Term Preferred Stock.\nAs of March 31, 2019, our asset coverage ratio on our senior securities representing indebtedness was 997.6% and our asset coverage on our senior securities that are stock (our Series D Term Preferred Stock and our Series E Term Preferred Stock) was 309.1%.\nInvestment Highlights\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, and inclusive of non-cash transactions, we invested $57.8 million in two new portfolio companies, received $175.8 million in proceeds from repayments and sales, and extended $54.3 million of follow-on investments to existing portfolio companies through revolver draws, term loans, and additions to equity, as applicable.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the following significant transactions occurred:\n \u2022 In April 2018, we invested $29.2 million in Bassett Creek Restoration, Inc. (d/b/a J.R. Johnson, LLC) (\u201cBassett Creek\u201d) through a combination of secured first lien debt and preferred equity. Bassett Creek, headquartered in Portland, Oregon, is a leading provider of commercial restoration and renovation services to the Oregon and Southwest Washington region. \n \u2022 In June 2018, we sold our investment in Drew Foam Companies, Inc. (\u201cDrew Foam\u201d), which resulted in dividend and success fee income of $0.2 million and a realized gain of $13.8 million. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of $27.3 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $9.9 million at par. \n \u2022 In July 2018, we exited our investment in NDLI, Inc. (\u201cNDLI\u201d) and recorded a realized loss of $3.6 million. \n \u2022 In October 2018, we invested an additional $15.0 million of secured first lien debt into J.R. Hobbs, which together with our existing $21.0 million secured first lien term loan resulted in a new $36.0 million secured first lien term loan due in October 2023. \n \u2022 In October 2018, we exited our equity investment in Country Club Enterprises, LLC (\u201cCCE\u201d), which resulted in a realized loss of $7.7 million. As part of this transaction, we received success fee income of $1.0 million, reduced our existing guaranty to $1.0 million, and amended our existing $4.0 million secured second lien term loan to have a stated interest rate of LIBOR + 8.0% and mature in February 2022. \n \u2022 In November 2018, we sold our investment in Logo Sportswear, Inc.

(\u201cStar Seed\u201d), which resulted in success fee income of $0.5 million and a realized gain of $5.4 million. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of $12.5 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $5.0 million at par. \n \u2022 In January 2019, we restructured two of our first lien term loans to SOG Specialty Knives & Tools, LLC (\u201cSOG\u201d) with a total cost basis of $18.4 million into a new $8.4 million first lien term loan, which resulted in a realized loss of $10.0 million. The new term loan has a stated interest rate of LIBOR + 4.0% and matures in August 2022. In addition, we invested $1.0 million of preferred equity in SOG. \n \u2022 In March 2019, we restructured our existing second lien term loans and delayed draw term loan to The Mountain Corporation (\u201cThe Mountain\u201d) with a total cost basis of $21.7 million into a new $11.7 million second lien term loan, which resulted in a realized loss of $10.0 million. The new term loan has a stated interest rate of LIBOR + 4.0% and matures in April 2024. In addition, we extended a new $2.9 million first lien line of credit to The Mountain of which $2.5 million was outstanding as of March 31, 2019. The line of credit has a stated interest rate of LIBOR + 5.0% and matures in April 2020.  The following significant investment activity occurred subsequent to March 31, 2019. Also refer to Note 15 - Subsequent Events in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n \u2022 In April 2019, we sold our investment in Tread Corporation (\u201cTread\u201d), which had a cost basis and fair value of $7.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2019. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of $4.4 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $3.2 million at par. \n \u2022 In April 2019, we sold our investment in Jackrabbit, Inc., which had a cost basis and fair value of $14.7 million and $19.2 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2019. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of $19.7 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $11.0 million at par. \n \u2022 In April and May 2019, we extended a line of credit to J.R. Hobbs with a total commitment amount of $10.0 million at a stated interest rate of LIBOR + 10.25%, which matures in October 2019.

Not Meaningful\nInvestment Income\nTotal investment income increased by 2.2% for the year ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year. This increase was due to increases in both interest income and dividend, success fee, and other income.\nInterest income from our investments in debt securities increased 1.7% for the year ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year. Generally, the level of interest income from investments is directly related to the principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio outstanding during the period multiplied by the weighted-average yield. The weighted-average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio during the year ended March 31, 2019 was $380.2 million, compared to $373.4 million during the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the origination of $44.3 million of new debt investments and $51.7 million of follow-on debt investments to existing portfolio companies and $16.5 million of loans placed back on accrual status after March 31, 2018, partially offset by the pay-off or restructure of $65.3 million of debt investments and $68.3 million of loans placed on non-accrual status, and their respective impact on the weighted-average principal balance when considering the timing of new investments, pay-offs, restructures, and accrual status changes, as applicable. The weighted-average yield on our interest-bearing investments, excluding cash and cash equivalents and receipts recorded as other income, was 13.0% and 13.1% for the year ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted-average yield may vary from period to period, based on the current stated interest rate on interest-bearing investments.\nAt March 31, 2019, certain of our loans to B-Dry, LLC (\u201cB-Dry\u201d), Meridian Rack & Pinion, Inc. (\u201cMeridian\u201d), The Mountain, PSI Molded Plastics, Inc. (\u201cPSI Molded\u201d), and SOG were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of $68.3 million. At March 31, 2018, certain of our loans to two portfolio companies, Alloy Die Casting (\u201cADC\u201d) and Tread, were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of $15.6 million.\nDividend, success fee, and other income for the year ended March 31, 2019 increased 5.0% from the prior year. During the year ended March 31, 2019, dividend, success fee, and other income primarily consisted of $3.9 million of dividend income and $6.1 million of success fee income. During the year ended March 31, 2018, dividend, success fee, and other income primarily consisted of $4.2 million of dividend income and $5.3 million of success fee income.\nThe following table lists the fair value and investment income for our five largest portfolio company investments, at fair value, as of the end and during the respective fiscal years:\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of March 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nPortfolio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Investment\nIncome </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total\nInvestment\nIncome </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nth Degree, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> J.R.

The capital gains-based incentive fee was a result of the net impact of net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments during the respective periods. The income-based incentive fee decreased for the year ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year, as the increase in net assets, which drives the hurdle rate, more than offset the increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income during the respective periods.\nThe base management fee increased for the year ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year, as average total assets increased over the respective periods as a result of an increase in investments at fair value.\nThe base management fee, loan servicing fee, incentive fee, and their related non-contractual, unconditional, and irrevocable credits are computed quarterly, as described under \u201cTransactions with the Adviser\u201d in Note 4 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are summarized in the following table:\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average total assets subject to base management fee(A)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>637,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539,800 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multiplied by annual base management fee of 2.0%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Base management fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,796 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credits to fees from Adviser - other(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,509 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,674 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net base management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan servicing fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,277 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credits to base management fee - loan servicing fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,827 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,277 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loan servicing fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incentive fee - income-based\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,249 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incentive fee - capital gains-based(C)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total incentive fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,648 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credits to fees from Adviser - other(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net total incentive fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,648 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) Average total assets subject to the base management fee is defined in the Advisory Agreement as total assets, including investments made with proceeds of borrowings, less any uninvested cash or cash equivalents resulting from borrowings, valued at the end of the applicable quarters within the respective periods and adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the periods. \n (B) Reflected as a line item on our accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n (C) The capital gains-based incentive fee is not yet contractually due under the terms of the Advisory Agreement.  Interest and dividend expense increased 14.2% during the year ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in interest expense as a result of a higher weighted-average balance outstanding on the Credit Facility and slightly higher costs of borrowings under the Credit Facility as the increase in LIBOR more than offset the reduced interest rate margin after the amendment of the Credit Facility in August 2018. The effective interest rate on the Credit Facility, excluding the impact of deferred financing costs, during the year ended March 31, 2019 was 5.9%, as compared to 5.4% in the prior year. The weighted-average balance outstanding on the Credit Facility during the year ended March 31, 2019 was $97.9 million, as compared to $67.8 million in the prior year. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Line of Credit\u201d for further discussion of the Credit Facility. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Term Preferred Stock\u201d for further discussion of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.\nOther expenses increased 58.7% primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of $1.4 million largely driven by accrual status changes in the current year.\nRealized and Unrealized Gain (Loss), net of Taxes\nNet Realized Gain on Investments\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded net realized gains on investments of $68.6 million, primarily related to a $65.7 million realized gain from the exit of Cambridge, a $13.8 million realized gain from the exit of Drew Foam, a $13.0 million realized gain from the exit of Logo, and a $5.4 million realized gain from the exit of Star Seed, partially offset by a $10.0 million realized loss from the restructure of our debt investments in The Mountain, a $10.0 million realized loss from the restructure of our debt investments in SOG, a $7.7 million realized loss from the exit of our equity investment in CCE and a $3.6 million realized loss from the exit of NDLI. During the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a net realized gain on investments of $1.3 million, primarily related to a $1.0 million realized gain from the exit of Mitchell Rubber Products, Inc. (\u201cMitchell\u201d).\nTaxes on Deemed Distribution of Long-Term Capital Gains\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, we elected to retain $50.0 million of long-term capital gains and to treat them as deemed distributions to common stockholders. We incurred $10.5 million of federal taxes on behalf of common stockholders for the year ended March 31, 2019. In addition, we recorded a reserve for uncertain tax positions related to potential Virginia state tax exposure related to the deemed distribution of $3.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. Refer to Note 9 - Distributions to Common Stockholders in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNet Realized Loss on Other\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded a net realized loss on other of $1.7 million which primarily related to unamortized deferred issuance costs written off upon the redemption of our 6.750% Series B Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (our \u201cSeries B Term Preferred Stock\u201d) and 6.500% Series C Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (our \u201cSeries C Term Preferred Stock\u201d) in August 2018. There were no realized gains or losses on other during the year ended March 31, 2018.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded net unrealized appreciation of investments of $20.2 million.

performance of certain of our portfolio companies, an increase in comparable multiples used to estimate the fair value of certain of our portfolio companies, and the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation of certain investments upon their exit or restructure, partially offset by the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation upon the exit of certain of our investments and a decline in performance of certain of our other portfolio companies.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded net unrealized appreciation of investments of $37.9 million.
