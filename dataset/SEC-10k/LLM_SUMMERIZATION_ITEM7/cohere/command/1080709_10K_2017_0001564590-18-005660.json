Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. Operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods.\nThis discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual events or results may differ materially from our expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report are based on information available to us as of the time we file this Annual Report and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements. In addition, statements that we believe\u201d and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Annual Report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain.\nOVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, small molecule drugs with optimized receptor pharmacology designed to deliver clinical utility across multiple therapeutic areas. Our proprietary, internally-developed pipeline includes potentially first- or best-in-class programs.\nOur three most advanced investigational clinical programs include:\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Ralinepag, which we are preparing for a Phase 3 program for pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Etrasimod, which is being studied in Phase 2 trials for a broad range of immune and inflammatory conditions, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> APD371 for a broad range of visceral pain conditions and which is being studied in a Phase 2 trial for treatment of pain associated with Crohn's disease, or CD.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continue to explore additional indications for all of our clinical-stage programs. Additionally, we have collaborations with the following pharmaceutical companies:\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Everest Medicines Limited, or Everest, in their efforts with respect to ralinepag and etrasimod in Greater China and select Asian countries,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Eisai Co., Ltd. and Eisai Inc., or collectively, Eisai, in their efforts with respect to BELVIQ/BELVIQ XR, which are marketed products,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Axovant Sciences GmbH, or Axovant, in its efforts with respect to nelotanserin, an orally available inverse agonist of the serotonin 2A receptor, which is in development for various neurological disorders, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, targeting a G protein-coupled receptor that belongs to the group of orphan central nervous system receptors, which is in preclinical development stage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, we reported positive topline Phase 2 results for ralinepag in patients with PAH and raised $236.4 million through completion of two underwritten public offerings of shares of our common stock. We also made changes to the composition of our board of directors and hired a new chief medical officer.\nOn March 9, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or Sale Agreement, with Siegfried Pharma AG and Siegfried AG (collectively and individually, Siegfried). Under the Sale Agreement, we agreed to sell and assign to Siegfried, and Siegfried agreed to purchase and assume from Arena GmbH, certain drug product finishing facility assets and know-how, including fixtures, equipment, other personal property and real estate assets located in Zofingen, Switzerland, related contracts and certain related liabilities after the closing as well as to the transfer of all of Arena GmbH's approximately 50 current employees, or collectively, Manufacturing Operations. We refer to this transaction as Siegfried Transaction. The Siegfried Transaction is expected to close on or about March 31, 2018, subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions. As a result of the Siegfried Transaction, we have excluded from our continuing operations for all periods presented in this report revenues and expenses associated with our manufacturing operations to be divested, which are reported as discontinued operations. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Manufacturing Operations.\nIn December 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Everest Agreement, with Everest. Under the Everest Agreement, we granted Everest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize two of our\nproduct candidates, ralinepag (in any formulation) and etrasimod (in oral formulations only), in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea, or the Everest Territories. Everest will be responsible for all development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed products in the Everest Territories, and may participate in the portion of our global clinical trials that is conducted in the Everest Territories. In addition to an upfront payment of $12.0 million which we collected in December 2017, we are eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments from Everest of up to $212.0 million for both licensed products, as well as tiered royalties on net sales ranging from the high single digits to low double digits. Following an initial royalty term, we are eligible to receive a lower trademark royalty if Everest continues to use our licensed product-related trademarks.\nSince 2010, a number of complaints were filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of California, or District Court, against us and certain of our current and former employees and directors on behalf of certain purchasers of our common stock. The complaints were brought as purported stockholder class actions, and, in general, include allegations that we and certain of our current and former employees and directors violated federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements regarding our BELVIQ program, thereby artificially inflating the price of our common stock. In November 2017, we and the lead plaintiff signed a stipulation and agreement of settlement, or Stipulation, to resolve the consolidated class action. Under the terms of the Stipulation, and in exchange for a release of all claims by class members and a dismissal of the consolidated class action with prejudice, we have agreed (i) our insurers will pay class members and their attorneys a total of approximately $12.025 million and (ii) Arena will pay class members and their attorneys approximately $11.975 million in either shares of our common stock or cash at our election. The terms of the settlement remain subject to preliminary approval by the District Court. If the settlement is preliminarily approved by the District Court, potential class members will be notified of the proposed settlement and the procedure by which they can become class members. The settlement will then be subject to final approval by the District Court.\nIn June 2017, we filed a certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware to effect a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report give retrospective effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented. All issued and outstanding common stock, options exercisable for common stock, restricted stock units, performance restricted stock units, and per share amounts contained in this Annual Report have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split for all periods presented. Concurrent with the reverse stock split we effected a reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 367,500,000 shares to 73,500,000 shares.\nIn general, developing drugs and obtaining marketing approval is a long, uncertain and expensive process, and our ability to execute on our plans and achieve our goals depends on numerous factors, many of which we do not control. To date, we have generated limited revenues. We expect to continue to incur substantial net losses for at least the short term as we advance our clinical development programs, and support our collaborators.\nWe plan to raise additional cash from outside sources in order to carry out our operational strategy and advance our clinical pipeline. There is no guarantee that adequate funds will be available when needed from additional debt or equity financing, development and commercialization partnerships or from other sources, or on terms acceptable to us. If our efforts to obtain sufficient additional funds are not successful, we would be required to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our research or development, manufacturing operations, administrative operations, and clinical or regulatory activities, which could negatively affect our ability to achieve certain corporate goals. We believe our cash resources are sufficient to allow us to continue operations for at least the next twelve months from the date this Annual Report is filed with the SEC.\nSee the above Business\u201d section for a more complete discussion of our business.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe are providing the following summary of our revenues, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses to supplement the more detailed discussion below. This summary excludes our revenues, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses associated with our Manufacturing Operations, which are reported within income (loss) from discontinued operations.

</tr>\n</table>\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016\nRevenues. In December 2016, we amended and restated the terms of the marketing and supply agreement for lorcaserin with Eisai by entering into a new Transaction Agreement and a new Supply Agreement (collectively, the Eisai Agreement) with Eisai. Under the Eisai Agreement, Eisai acquired global commercialization and manufacturing rights to lorcaserin, including in the territories retained by us under the prior agreement, with control over global development and commercialization decisions. Eisai is responsible for all lorcaserin development expenses going forward. We also assigned to Eisai our rights under the commercial lorcaserin distribution agreements with Ildong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Ildong, for South Korea; CY Biotech Company Limited, or CYB, for Taiwan; and Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s Israeli subsidiary, Abic Marketing Limited, or Teva, for Israel.\nPrior to the Eisai Agreement, we received from Eisai, Ildong, CYB and Teva total upfront payments of $122.5 million. Revenues from these upfront payments were previously deferred, as we determined that the exclusive rights did not have standalone value without our ongoing development and regulatory activities. Accordingly, these payments were recognized ratably as revenue over the periods in which we expected the services to be rendered. The Eisai Agreement eliminated our obligation to continue performing the development and regulatory activities required in the prior agreements. Therefore, on December 28, 2016, $64.0 million of deferred revenues from these upfront payments was allocated to the rights delivered by us to Eisai pursuant to the Eisai Agreement and recognized as revenue in 2016.\nWe recognized revenues of $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to $66.0 million of revenue recorded in 2016 from upfront payments for lorcaserin collaborations received from Eisai in prior years, and $5.7 million of revenue recorded in 2016 from upfront payments for other lorcaserin collaborations received from Ildong and CYB in prior years with no similar revenue in 2017 and a total of $12.3 million of milestones from Eisai and Ildong that we earned during 2016 primarily from the approval of the once-daily formulation of lorcaserin in the United States (branded as BELVIQ XR), the approval of the twice-daily formulation of lorcaserin in Mexico (branded as VENESPRI), and the approval of BELVIQ in Brazil. These decreases were partially offset by $12.0 million revenue in 2017 related to an upfront payment pursuant to a collaboration agreement with Everest entered into in December 2017 and $1.7 million of royalty revenue recorded in 2017 under the Eisai Agreement.\nAbsent any new collaborations, we expect our 2018 revenues will primarily consist of (i) royalty payments from Eisai based upon Eisai's sales of BELVIQ to its distributors, (ii) amortization of upfront payments we have received from our collaborators and (iii) reimbursements from collaborators for research funding.\nRevenues from royalties based on sales of BELVIQ are difficult to predict, and our overall revenues will likely vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. In the short term, we expect the amount of BELVIQ-related revenue we earn to fluctuate significantly due to the terms of the Eisai Agreement.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses, which account for the majority of our expenses, consist primarily of salaries and other personnel costs, clinical trial costs (including payments to contract research organizations, or CROs), preclinical study fees, manufacturing costs for non-commercial products, research supply costs and facility and equipment costs. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred when these expenditures have no alternative future uses. We generally do not track our earlier-stage, internal research and development expenses by project; rather, we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $7.2 million to $71.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $63.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $13.9 million in external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs partially offset by decreases of $3.7 million in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, $2.7 million in facility and equipment costs, $1.5 million in research supply costs and $1.3 million in salary and other personnel costs, primarily due to the workforce reductions in 2016.\nWe expect to incur substantial research and development expenses in 2018 and for the aggregate amount in 2018 to be potentially greater than the amount incurred in 2017. We expect our internal costs to be higher primarily due to increasing headcount related to advancing the ralinepag and etrasimod programs and we also expect to incur higher external clinical trial costs in connection with Phase 3 clinical trials for ralinepag, including patient enrollment. Our actual expenses may be higher or lower than anticipated due to various factors, including our progress and results. For example, patient enrollment in our Phase 3 clinical program for ralinepag is expected to be competitive and challenging, and could take longer than originally projected, which may result in our related external expenses being lower in 2018 than anticipated (but which might increase the overall costs for completing this multi-year program).\nIncluded in the $43.4 million of total external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs noted in the table above in this section for the year ended December 31, 2017, were the following:\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $28.7 million related to etrasimod,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $9.7 million related to ralinepag, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $2.8 million related to APD371.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncluded in the $29.5 million of total external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs noted in the table above in this section for the year ended December 31, 2016, were the following:\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $17.6 million related to etrasimod,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $4.7 million related to ralinepag,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $4.2 million related to lorcaserin, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $1.1 million related to APD371.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCumulatively from our inception through December 31, 2017, we have recognized (i) external clinical and preclinical study fees of $307.7 million for lorcaserin, $62.2 million for etrasimod, $43.8 million for nelotanserin, $30.8 million for ralinepag and $10.3 million for APD371 and (ii) $53.0 million for non-commercial manufacturing and other development costs for lorcaserin and, to a lesser extent, nelotanserin.\nWhile expenditures on current and future clinical development programs are expected to be substantial, they are subject to many uncertainties, including whether we have adequate funds and develop our drug candidates with one or more collaborators or independently. As a result of such uncertainties, we cannot predict with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or whether, when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our drug candidates. The duration and cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development and a variety of factors, including:\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the nature and number of trials and studies in a clinical program;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the potential therapeutic indication;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number of patients who participate in the trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number and location of sites included in the trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the rates of patient recruitment, enrollment and withdrawal;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the duration of patient treatment and follow-up;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of manufacturing drug candidates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs, requirements, timing of, and the ability to secure and maintain regulatory approvals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to increases of $1.5 million in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, and $0.4 million in salary and other personnel costs, both primarily due to the increase in hiring activity in the latter half of 2017, an increase of $0.4 million in facility and equipment costs, and an increase of $0.4 million in legal, accounting and other professional fees. We expect that our 2018 general and administrative expenses will be higher than in 2017.\nLitigation settlement expense, net. Litigation settlement expense, net was $11.975 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This expense related to a stipulation and agreement of settlement we entered into in November 2017 in connection with a stockholder class action. The accrued amount represents the allocated value of the settlement that we will pay either in shares of our common stock or in cash, at our election. We expect this amount will be settled during the second quarter of 2018.\nRestructuring charges. We recognized $6.1 million of restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with employee termination costs, including severance and other benefits, related to the reduction of our US workforce in 2016. We incurred no similar charges in 2017.\nInterest and other expense, net. Interest and other expense, net, decreased by $3.1 million to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to (i) $0.4 million in gain on sale and disposal of equipment for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.3 million in net loss on sale and disposal of equipment for the year ended December 31, 2016, (ii) an increase of $1.0 million in rental income from additional sublease activity in 2017, and (iii) a decrease of $0.4 million in interest expense.\nDiscontinued operations. On March 9, 2018, Arena GmbH entered into the Sale Agreement with Siegfried to divest our Manufacturing Operations. The Siegfried Transaction is expected to close on or about March 31, 2018, subject to satisfaction or\nwaiver of certain customary closing conditions. As a result of the Siegfried Transaction, we have excluded from our continuing operations for all periods presented in this report revenues and expenses associated with our manufacturing operations to be divested, or Manufacturing Operations, which are reported as discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, income from discontinued operations was $3.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, loss from discontinued operations was $10.6 million. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Manufacturing Operations.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015\nRevenues. We recognized revenues of $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to (i) $66.0 million of revenue recorded in 2016 from upfront payments for lorcaserin collaborations received from Eisai, compared to $7.5 million in 2015, (ii) $5.7 million of revenue recorded in 2016 from upfront payments for other lorcaserin collaborations received from Ildong and CYB, compared to $0.5 million in 2015, (iii) a total of $12.3 million of milestones from Eisai and Ildong that we earned during 2016 primarily from the approval of the once-daily formulation of lorcaserin in the United States (branded as BELVIQ XR), the approval of the twice-daily formulation of lorcaserin in Mexico (branded as VENESPRI), and the approval of BELVIQ in Brazil, compared to $3.0 million of milestones from Ildong that we earned in February 2015 for the approval of BELVIQ in South Korea and (iv) $5.1 million earned in the year ended December 31, 2016, under our collaboration agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim, or Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement, which commenced in December 2015.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased by $19.5 million to $63.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $83.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to decreases of $11.9 million in salary and other personnel costs, $3.9 million in research supply costs, $2.0 million in facility and equipment costs, and $1.9 million in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, primarily due to the reduction in the number of our research and development employees in 2016.\nIncluded in the $29.5 million of total external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs noted in the table above in this section for the year ended December 31, 2016, were the following:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $17.6 million related to etrasimod,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $4.7 million related to ralinepag,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $4.2 million related to lorcaserin, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $1.1 million related to APD371.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncluded in the $29.1 million of total external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs noted in the table above in this section for the year ended December 31, 2015, were the following:\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $10.8 million related to lorcaserin,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $8.7 million related to etrasimod,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $5.1 million related to ralinepag, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $3.5 million related to APD371.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by $2.8 million to $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to decreases of $2.5 million in salary and other personnel costs and $2.1 million in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, primarily due to reductions in the number of our employees in 2016 and 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in legal, accounting and other professional fees and an increase of $0.6 million in facility and equipment costs.\nRestructuring charges. We recognized $6.1 million of restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with employee termination costs, including severance and other benefits, related to the reduction of our US workforce to which we committed in June 2016. We recognized $3.3 million of restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2015, in connection with employee termination costs, including severance and other benefits, related to the workforce reductions to which we committed in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nInterest and other expense, net. Interest and other expense, net, decreased by $0.2 million to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDiscontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, loss from discontinued operations was $10.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, income from discontinued operations was $2.7 million. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Manufacturing Operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe have accumulated a large deficit since inception that has primarily resulted from the significant research and development expenditures we have made in seeking to identify and develop compounds that could become marketed drugs. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses for at least the short term.\nTo date, we have obtained cash and funded our operations to date primarily through the sale of common and preferred stock, the issuance of debt and related financial instruments, payments from collaborators and customers and sale leaseback transactions. From our inception through December 31, 2017, we have generated $2.3 billion in cash from these sources, of which $1.6 billion was through sales of equity, $560.5 million was through payments from collaborators and customers, $96.9 million was through the issuance of debt and related financial instruments and $77.1 million was from sale and leaseback transactions.\nShort term liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $271.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments. In addition to payments expected from Eisai for royalties, our other potential sources of liquidity in the short term include (i) milestone and other payments from collaborators, (ii) entering into new collaboration, licensing or commercial agreements for one or more of our drug candidates or programs, (iii) the sale or lease of our facilities or other assets and (iv) sale of equity, issuance of debt or other transactions.\nLong term liquidity.\nIt will require substantial cash to achieve our objectives of discovering, developing and commercializing drugs, and this process typically takes many years and potentially several hundreds of millions of dollars for an individual drug. We may not have adequate available cash, or assets that could be readily turned into cash, to meet these objectives in the long term. We will need to obtain significant funds under our existing collaborations, under new collaboration, licensing or other commercial agreements for one or more of our drug candidates and programs or patent portfolios, or from other potential sources of liquidity, which may include the sale of equity, issuance of debt or other transactions.\nIn addition to potential payments from our current collaborators, as well as funds from public and private financial markets, potential sources of liquidity in the long term include (i) upfront, milestone, royalty and other payments from any future collaborators or licensees and (ii) revenues from sales of any drugs we obtain regulatory approval to commercialize on our own. The length of time that our current cash and cash equivalents and any available borrowings will sustain our operations will be based on, among other things, the rate of adoption and commercial success of BELVIQ and any other drug we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval to market, regulatory decisions affecting our and our collaborator's drug candidates, prioritization decisions regarding funding for our programs, progress in our clinical and earlier-stage programs, the time and costs related to current and future clinical trials and nonclinical studies, our research, development, manufacturing and commercialization costs (including personnel costs), our progress in any programs under collaborations, costs associated with intellectual property, our capital expenditures, and costs associated with securing any in-licensing opportunities. Any significant shortfall in funding may result in us reducing our development and/or research activities, which, in turn, would affect our development pipeline and ability to obtain cash in the future.\nWe evaluate from time to time potential acquisitions, in-licensing and other opportunities. Any such transaction may impact our liquidity as well as affect our expenses if, for example, our operating expenses increase as a result of such acquisition or license or we use our cash to finance the acquisition or license.\nSources and uses of our cash.\nNet cash used in operating activities increased by $4.5 million to $66.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $62.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to (i) an increase of $13.7 million in payments made for external clinical study fees, (ii) the $10.0 million payment we received from Eisai in December 2016 in connection of the sale of bulk inventory under the Eisai Agreement, while we did not receive any similar payment in the year ended December 31, 2017, and (iii) the $7.5 million payment we received from Boehringer Ingelheim in February 2016 upon entering into the Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement. These increases in net cash used in operating activities were partially offset by (i) the $12.0 million we received from Everest in December 2017 upon entering into the collaboration agreement with Everest, (ii) an increase of $5.9 million in net payments we received from Eisai and other BELVIQ distributors, from $9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, to $15.2\nmillion (primarily consisting of $7.2 million of manufacturing support payments related to the Eisai Agreement and $5.2 million in net settlement payments related to the prior agreements) in the year ended December 31, 2017, and (iii) decreased cash expenditures of approximately $10.7 million for personnel costs primarily resulting from the workforce reductions payments in 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $36.0 million to $62.1 million, compared to $98.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to (i) the $10.0 million we received from Eisai in December 2016 pursuant to entering the Eisai Agreement, (ii) a decrease of $9.6 million in payments made for external clinical and preclinical study fees, (iii) reduced cash expenditures of approximately $9.4 million for personnel costs primarily resulting from the workforce reductions we effected at the end of 2015, in June 2016, and in July 2016, (iv) the $7.5 million payment we received from Boehringer Ingelheim, less $1.2 million of withholding taxes (which was refunded to us in October 2016), in February 2016 upon entering into the Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement, while we did not receive any similar upfront payments in the year ended December 31, 2015, and (v) reduced cash expenditures for research supply costs and facility and equipment costs primarily resulting from the workforce reductions. These decreases in net cash used in operations were partially offset by (i) the $3.0 million milestone payment we received from Ildong, less withholding taxes, in March 2015 for the marketing approval of BELVIQ in South Korea, while we did not receive any similar milestone payment in the year December 31, 2016, and (ii) net payments of $7.6 million we received for shipments of BELVIQ to Eisai and Ildong in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $10.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $111.6 million to $112.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to $112.6 million in net purchases of available-for-sale investments in the year ended December 31, 2017, while there was no similar investing activity in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to $1.0 million in purchases of property and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $11.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 including the investing activities classified as discontinued operations, partially offset by (i) a $1.3 million decrease in net proceeds from the sale of equipment and (ii) a $0.8 million increase in deposits and restricted cash in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a $0.6 million decrease in deposits and restricted cash in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash of $245.3 million was provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, as a result of net proceeds of $236.4 million from our April 2017 and July 2017 offerings of our common stock, net proceeds of $7.0 million from the sale of our common stock under our ATM facility and net proceeds of $5.4 million from stock option exercises, partially offset by $3.5 million of principal payments on our lease financing obligations. Net cash of $2.3 million was used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of $3.0 million of principal payments on our lease financing obligations, partially offset by net proceeds of $0.4 million from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and a $0.3 million security deposit received from a sublessee. Net cash of $101.1 million was provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of net proceeds of $100.7 million from our January 2015 offering of 2,100,000 shares of common stock and net proceeds of $3.0 million from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, which were partially offset by $2.5 million for principal payments on our lease financing obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, in thousands:\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 83,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur financing obligations\u201d relate to sale and leaseback transactions for certain of our properties. We have applied the financing method to these sale and leaseback transactions, which requires that the book value of the properties and related accumulated depreciation remain on our balance sheet with no sale recognized. The sales price of the properties is recorded as a financing obligation and a portion of each lease payment is recorded as interest expense. At December 31, 2017, we expect interest expense over the remaining term of these leases to total $31.6 million. Other of our properties are under operating leases and are included under operating leases\u201d above.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements.\nWe do not have and did not have at December 31, 2017, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCOLLABORATIONS\nEverest.\nIn December 2017, we and Everest entered into an exclusive agreement to conduct joint development for the ralinepag and etrasimod programs. Under this agreement, we granted Everest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize ralinepag (in any formulation) and etrasimod (in oral formulations), in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea, or collectively, the Territories. Everest is generally responsible for development and commercialization of the licensed products in the Territories, and may participate in the portion of our global clinical trials that is conducted in the Territories.\nWe received from Everest an upfront payment of $12.0 million in December 2017. Revenues from this upfront payment were recognized in December 2017 as we determined (i) that the license is a deliverable with standalone value to Everest and (ii) the upfront payment represents consideration to be allocated to the delivered license.\nWe are also eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $212.0 million in success milestones in case of full commercial success of multiple drug products. Of these payments, six development milestones totaling $49.5 million are substantive, nine regulatory milestones totaling $22.5 million are substantive and six commercial milestones totaling $140.0 million are non-substantive. We are further eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of ralinepag and etrasimod products in the Territories.\nEisai.\nIn July 2010, we granted Eisai exclusive commercialization rights for lorcaserin (marketed as BELVIQ\u00ae / BELVIQ XR\u00ae) solely in the United States and its territories and possessions. In May 2012, we and Eisai entered into the first amended and restated agreement, which expanded Eisai's exclusive commercialization rights to include most of North and South America. In November 2013, we and Eisai entered into the second amended and restated agreement, or Second Amended Agreement, which expanded Eisai's exclusive commercialization rights for lorcaserin to all of the countries in the world, except for South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and Israel.\nIn December 2016, we and Eisai amended and restated the terms of marketing and supply agreement for lorcaserin with Eisai by entering into a Transaction Agreement and a Supply Agreement (collectively, the Eisai Agreement) with Eisai. Under the Transaction Agreement, Eisai acquired an exclusive royalty-bearing license or transfer of intellectual property to global commercialization and manufacturing rights to lorcaserin, including in the territories retained by us under the prior agreement, with control over global development and commercialization decisions. Eisai is responsible for all lorcaserin development expenses going forward. We also assigned to Eisai our rights under the commercial lorcaserin distribution agreements with Ildong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Ildong, for South Korea; CY Biotech Company Limited, or CYB, for Taiwan; and Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s Israeli subsidiary, Abic Marketing Limited, or Teva, for Israel. This is collectively referred to as License Deliverable.\nUnder the Supply Agreement, Eisai paid us $10.0 million to acquire our entire on-hand inventory of bulk lorcaserin and the precursor material for manufacturing lorcaserin, which is referred to as Inventory Deliverable. Eisai is also paying us for finished drug product plus up to CHF 13.0 million in manufacturing support payments over an initial two-year supply period.\nWe manufacture lorcaserin at our facility in Zofingen, Switzerland. Revenues earned for (i) lorcaserin sold by us to Eisai under the manufacturing and supply commitment within the Supply Agreement, or Manufacturing and Supply Commitment Deliverable, and formerly sold by us to Eisai, Ildong, CYB and Teva for commercial or development purposes under the prior lorcaserin collaboration agreements and (ii) the manufacturing support payments are classified within discontinued operations as part of the Manufacturing Operations on the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 5). All other revenues earned under the Transaction Agreement and the prior lorcaserin collaboration agreements, such as royalties, licenses, milestones and development expense reimbursements, are classified within continuing operations on the consolidated statements of operations.\nRoyalty payments.\nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we are eligible to receive royalty payments from Eisai based on the global net sales of lorcaserin. The royalty rates are as follows:\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 9.5% on annual net sales less than or equal to $175.0 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 13.5% on annual net sales greater than $175.0 million but less than or equal to $500.0 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 18.5% of annual net sales greater than $500.0 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe record revenues from the royalty payments in the period in which the net sales upon which the royalties are calculated occur as reported to us by Eisai. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized royalty revenue of $1.7 million under the Eisai Agreement.\nUpfront payments.\nPrior to the Transaction Agreement, we received from Eisai total upfront payments of $115.0 million under prior lorcaserin collaboration agreements. Revenues from these upfront payments were previously deferred, as we determined that the exclusive rights did not have standalone value without our ongoing development and regulatory activities. Accordingly, these payments were recognized ratably as revenue over the periods in which we expected the services to be rendered. The Transaction Agreement effectively eliminated our obligation to continue performing the development and regulatory activities required in the original agreement, which resulted in acceleration of upfront payment revenue recognition in 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, we recognized revenue of $66.0 million and $7.5 million, respectively, related to these upfront payments.\nMilestone payments.\nIn July 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved the New Drug Application for BELVIQ XR. We earned from Eisai a $10.0 million substantive milestone payment from this achievement. In October 2016, Eisai announced the commercial launch of BELVIQ XR in the United States.\nIn July 2016, the Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risk approved the Marketing Authorization Application in Mexico for our twice-daily formulation of lorcaserin for chronic weight management. We earned from Eisai a $1.0 million substantive milestone payment from this achievement.\nIn December 2016, the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency provided regulatory approval in Brazil for BELVIQ. We earned from Eisai a $1.0 million substantive milestone payment from this achievement.\nWe are eligible to receive an additional substantive commercial milestone of $25.0 million upon the achievement of global net sales of lorcaserin for a calendar year first exceeding $250.0 million.\nProduct purchase price and inventory purchase.\nWe manufacture lorcaserin at our facility in Zofingen, Switzerland. Under the Eisai Agreement, we have agreed to manufacture and supply, and Eisai has agreed to purchase from us, all of Eisai's requirements (or specified minimum quantities if such quantities are greater than Eisai's requirements), subject to certain exceptions, for lorcaserin for development and commercial use for an initial two-year period. The initial period may be extended by Eisai for an additional six months upon payment of an extension fee of CHF 2.0 million. Eisai will pay us agreed upon prices to deliver finished drug product during this time. Additionally, Eisai has agreed to pay up to CHF 13.0 million in manufacturing support payments during the initial two-year period supply period, and pay up to CHF 6.0 million in manufacturing support payments during the six-month extension period, if the extension option is exercised by Eisai.\nUnder the Second Amended Agreement, we sold lorcaserin to Eisai for Eisai's commercialization in the United States for a purchase price of 31.5% of Eisai's aggregate annual net product sales (which are the gross invoiced sales less certain deductions described in the Second Amended Agreement), or the Product Purchase Price. The amount that Eisai paid us for lorcaserin product supply was based on Eisai's estimated price at the time the order was shipped, which was Eisai's estimate of the Eisai Product Purchase Price, and was subject to change on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Eisai Product Purchase Price for the product Eisai sold under the Second Amended Agreement was lower than the estimated price that Eisai paid us for such product, primarily due to an increase in deductions from savings cards and returns, partially offset by a decrease in vouchers. At the end of Eisai's fiscal year (March 31), the estimated price paid to us for product that Eisai sold to its distributors was compared to the Eisai Product Purchase Price of such product, and the difference was refunded back to Eisai for the overpayments. The $9.1 million classified as Payable to Eisai within the total liabilities of disposal group held for sale at December 31, 2016, relates to product sold by Eisai to its distributors from April 1, 2015, through March 31, 2016. Under the Eisai Agreement, we were not required to refund to Eisai any net overpayment which would have been otherwise due to Eisai under the Second Amended Agreement for product we sold to Eisai under the Second Amended Agreement which Eisai did not sell to its distributors on or before March 31, 2016. For product which Eisai sold to its distributors from April 1, 2016, through December 28, 2016, we recognized the net overpayment which would have been otherwise due to Eisai under the Second Amended Agreement of $2.0 million as revenues and included this amount in net product sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is a component of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations.\nPrior to December 2016, we deferred recognition of revenue and the related cost at the time we sold lorcaserin to Eisai because we did not have the ability to estimate the amount of product that could have been returned to us and thus recognized revenues and the related costs from net product sales when Eisai shipped BELVIQ to its distributors. Pursuant to a change in the terms of the Eisai Agreement, we determined that we achieved the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of product returns and recognize revenue and the related cost from product sales when we ship BELVIQ to Eisai. On December 28, 2016, we recognized revenues of $6.7 million and costs of $1.9 million on net product sales which had been previously deferred, which is a component of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations.\nAllocation of Eisai Agreement arrangement consideration to the units of accounting.\nThe total arrangement consideration of $115.6 million primarily consists of (i) the December 28, 2016, balances of deferred revenues from the upfront payments received under the prior Eisai agreements and the distribution agreements with Ildong, CYB and Teva; (ii) the $10.0 million payment received from Eisai on December 28, 2016; and (iii) the product purchase payments and manufacturing support payments we expect to receive from Eisai for the initial two-year manufacturing and supply commitment period.\nAll of the deliverables were determined to have standalone value and to meet the criteria to be accounted for as separate units of accounting. Factors considered in the determination included, among other things, for the license, the manufacturing experience and capabilities of Eisai and their sublicense rights, and for the remaining deliverables the fact that they are not proprietary and can be provided by other vendors. The total arrangement consideration was allocated to the units of accounting on the basis of their relative estimated selling prices as follows:\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $64.0 million was allocated to the License Deliverable.

There is no fixed schedule for delivery given a portion has been and will be delivered on a continuous basis as we perform under the manufacturing commitment, another portion has been and will be physically transferred to Eisai upon request by Eisai and the rest is expected to be physically transferred at the end of the manufacturing and supply commitment period. Also, the risks of ownership for this inventory did not pass to Eisai in 2016 as we have financial responsibility for loss, damage or destruction which occurs while in our possession. Therefore, none of the arrangement consideration allocated to this deliverable was recognized as revenue and none of the carrying value of this inventory was recognized as cost of product sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $6.4 million as\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> revenue of discontinued operations related to this deliverable and $0.9 million of the carrying value of this inventory as cost of product sales of discontinued operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $20.8 million was allocated to the Manufacturing and Supply Commitment Deliverable.

Under the Second Amended Agreement, Eisai and we were responsible for 90% and 10%, respectively, of the cost for the FDA-required portion of the cardiovascular outcomes trial, or CVOT, 50% and 50%, respectively, of the non-FDA portion of the studies and we were also obligated to share the cost of FDA-required studies in obese pediatric patients and for additional clinical studies in other territories.\nUnder the Eisai Agreement, Eisai is solely responsible for all costs and expenses in connection with further development of lorcaserin from and after July 1, 2016, and we were relieved of any obligations under the Second Amended Agreement to pay our share of future development costs of lorcaserin. Accordingly, on December 28, 2016, we recorded a reduction of research and development expenses which would have been otherwise due to Eisai under the Second Amended Agreement of $3.7 million for the period from July 1, 2016, through December 28, 2016.\nDecember 31, 2016, and 2015, we recognized expenses of $4.2 million, and $10.8 million, respectively, for external clinical study fees related to lorcaserin, which are included in continuing operations. There were no such expenses in 2017. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 we recognized expenses of $1.4 million, $3.1 million, and $5.4 million, respectively for internal non-commercial manufacturing costs primarily related to lorcaserin, which are included in discontinued operations.\nIldong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\nIn November 2012, we and Ildong entered into the Marketing and Supply Agreement, or Ildong Agreement. Under this agreement, we granted Ildong exclusive rights to commercialize BELVIQ in South Korea for weight loss or weight management in obese and overweight patients. We also provided certain services and manufacture and sold BELVIQ to Ildong. As noted above, the Ildong Agreement was assigned to Eisai pursuant to the Eisai Agreement on December 28, 2016.\nIn connection with entering into the Ildong Agreement, we received from Ildong an upfront payment of $5.0 million, less withholding taxes. Revenues from this upfront payment were deferred, as we determined that the exclusive rights did not have standalone value without our ongoing development and regulatory activities. Accordingly, this payment was recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which we expected the services to be rendered. The assignment of the Ildong Agreement pursuant to the\nEisai Agreement effectively eliminated our obligation to continue performing the development and regulatory activities required in the Ildong Agreement. Therefore, on December 28, 2016, the $3.5 million of deferred revenues from this upfront payment was allocated to the value of the License provided to Eisai and recognized as revenue in 2016.\nIn February 2015, we earned a substantive milestone payment of $3.0 million upon the approval of BELVIQ for marketing in South Korea for weight management. We received the payment, less withholding taxes, in March 2015.\nUnder the Ildong Agreement, we manufactured BELVIQ at our facility in Zofingen, Switzerland, and sold BELVIQ to Ildong for a purchase price starting at the higher of the defined minimum amount or 35% of Ildong's annual net product sales (which are the gross invoiced sales less certain deductions described in the Ildong Agreement), or the Ildong Product Purchase Price. The Ildong Product Purchase Price increased on a tiered basis up to the higher of the defined minimum amount or 45% on the portion of annual net product sales exceeding $15.0 million. Since the inception of commercial sales of BELVIQ in South Korea in 2015, the Ildong Product Purchase Price equaled the defined minimum amount (which exceeded the amounts calculated using the applicable percentages for the applicable tiers of Ildong's annual net product sales).\nPrior to December 2016, we deferred recognition of revenue and the related cost at the time we sold BELVIQ to Ildong because we did not have the ability to estimate the amount of product that could have been returned to us and thus recognized revenues and the related costs from net product sales when Ildong shipped BELVIQ to its distributors. In December 2016, we determined that we achieved the ability to reasonably estimate product returns under the Ildong Agreement. Accordingly, we recognized revenues of $2.0 million and costs of $0.7 million in December 2016 on net product sales which had been previously deferred, which is a component of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenues of $11.4 million and $8.9 million, respectively, under the Ildong agreement, of which $7.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively are included in discontinued operations. No revenues were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 under this agreement.\nCY Biotech Company Limited.\nIn July 2013, we entered into the CYB Agreement. Under this agreement, we granted CYB exclusive rights to commercialize BELVIQ in Taiwan for weight loss or weight management in obese and overweight patients, subject to regulatory approval of BELVIQ by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration, or TFDA. The CYB Agreement provided for us to perform certain services and to manufacture and sell BELVIQ to CYB. As noted above, the CYB Agreement was assigned to Eisai pursuant to the Eisai Agreement on December 28, 2016.\nIn connection with entering into the CYB agreement, we received from CYB an upfront payment of $2.0 million, less withholding taxes. Revenues from this upfront payment were deferred, as we determined that the exclusive rights did not have standalone value without our ongoing development and regulatory activities. Accordingly, this payment was recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which we expected the services to be rendered. The assignment of the CYB Agreement pursuant to the Eisai Agreement effectively eliminated our obligation to continue performing the development and regulatory activities required in the CYB Agreement. Therefore, on December 28, 2016, the $1.7 million of deferred revenues from this upfront payment was allocated to the value of the License provided to Eisai and recognized as revenue in 2016.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenues of $1.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively, under this agreement. No revenues were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 under this agreement.\nAxovant Sciences GmbH.\nIn May 2015, we entered into a Development, Marketing and Supply Agreement with Roivant Sciences Ltd., or Roivant. In October 2015, Roivant, assigned the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize nelotanserin to its subsidiary, Axovant. Under this agreement, Axovant has exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize nelotanserin, subject to regulatory approval. We also provide certain services and will manufacture and sell nelotanserin to Axovant.\nWe received an upfront payment of $4.0 million, which was recorded as deferred revenues and is being recognized as revenue ratably over approximately five years, which is the period in which we expect to provide services under the arrangement. We are entitled to receive payments from sales of nelotanserin under the agreement and are eligible to receive purchase price adjustment payments based on Axovant's annual net product sales. We are also eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $41.5 million in success milestones in case of full development and regulatory success of nelotanserin. Of these payments, two development milestones totaling $4.0 million are substantive and four regulatory milestones totaling $37.5 million are substantive.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and we recognized revenues of $2.2 million, $2.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, under this agreement.\nBoehringer Ingelheim International GmbH.\nIn December 2015, we and Boehringer Ingelheim entered into an exclusive agreement, under which we and Boehringer Ingelheim conduct joint research to identify drug candidates targeting an undisclosed G protein-coupled receptor, or GPCR, that belongs to the group of orphan central nervous system, or CNS, receptors. Under this agreement, we granted Boehringer Ingelheim exclusive rights to our internally discovered, novel compounds and intellectual property for an orphan CNS receptor. We jointly conduct research with Boehringer Ingelheim to identify additional drug candidates that are suitable for continued research and development as therapeutic compounds for various disease indications, with the initial focus expected to be psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia. The agreement grants Boehringer Ingelheim exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize products resulting from the collaboration.\nIn part consideration of the rights to our intellectual property necessary or useful to conduct the joint research under the agreement, we received from Boehringer Ingelheim an upfront payment of $7.5 million in January 2016, less $1.2 million of withholding taxes which was refunded to us in October 2016. Revenues from this upfront payment were deferred, as we determined that the exclusive rights did not have standalone value without our ongoing participation in the joint research, and are being recognized ratably as revenues over the period in which we expect the services to be rendered, which is approximately two years.\nWe are also eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $251.0 million (of which up to $12.0 million is payable to Beacon) in success milestones in case of full commercial success of multiple drug products. Of these payments, three development milestones totaling $7.0 million are substantive, three development milestones totaling $30.0 million are non-substantive, nine regulatory milestones totaling $84.0 million are non-substantive and four commercial milestones totaling $130.0 million are non-substantive.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, we recognized revenues of $5.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively under this agreement. We did not recognize any revenues under this agreement during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\nThe SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management's view, important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and demanding of management's judgment. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the US generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements:\nRevenue recognition. Our revenues to date have been generated primarily through collaboration agreements. Our collaboration agreements may contain multiple elements including commercialization rights, services (joint steering committee and research and development services) and manufactured products. Consideration we receive under these arrangements may include upfront payments, research and development funding, cost reimbursements, milestone payments, payments for product sales and royalty payments. We recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred and title has passed, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Any advance payments we receive in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenues.\nWe evaluate deliverables in a multiple-element arrangement to determine whether each deliverable represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value to the customer. If the delivered element does not have standalone value without one of the undelivered elements in the arrangement, we combine such elements and account for them as a single unit of accounting. The arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting at the inception of the arrangement based on the relative selling price. Determining whether a deliverable is a separate unit of accounting as well as estimating the selling prices of such unit of accounting requires the use of significant judgment. A change in such judgment could result in a significant change in the period in which revenue is recognized.\nTo determine the selling price of a separate deliverable, we use the hierarchy as prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605-25 based on vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, third-party evidence, or TPE, or best estimate of\nselling price, or BESP. VSOE is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately and is the price actually charged for that deliverable. TPE is determined based on third-party evidence for a similar deliverable when sold separately. BESP is the estimated selling price at which we would transact a sale if the elements of collaboration and license arrangements were sold on a stand-alone basis to the buyer. We may not be able to establish VSOE or TPE for the deliverables within collaboration and license arrangements, as we may not have a history of entering into such arrangements or selling the individual deliverables within such arrangements separately. In addition, there may be significant differentiation in these arrangements, which indicates that comparable third-party pricing may not be available. We may determine that the selling price for the deliverables within collaboration and license arrangements should be determined using BESP. The process for determining BESP involves significant judgment and includes consideration of multiple factors such as estimated revenues, market size, and development risk, among other factors contemplated in negotiating the arrangement with the customer.\nNon-refundable upfront payments received under our collaboration agreements for commercialization rights are deferred if such rights are not deemed to have standalone value without ongoing services which may be required under the agreement. If deferred, such amounts are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the period in which we expect to perform the services. In December 2016, we recognized a portion of the previously unrecognized non-refundable upfront payments received from Eisai and other BELVIQ distributors as revenues in the amount of arrangement consideration allocated to the unit of accounting delivered to Eisai under the Eisai Agreement.\nAmounts we receive as reimbursement for our research and development expenditures are recognized as revenue as the services are performed.\nUnder the milestone method, we recognize revenue that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. A milestone is an event (i) that can be achieved in whole or in part on either our performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance, (ii) for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and (iii) that would result in additional payments being due us. A milestone payment is considered substantive when the consideration payable to us for each milestone (a) is consistent with our performance necessary to achieve the milestone or the increase in value to the collaboration resulting from our performance, (b) relates solely to our past performance and (c) is reasonable relative to all of the other deliverables and payments under the arrangement. In making this assessment, we consider all facts and circumstances relevant to the arrangement, including factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone and whether any portion of the milestone consideration is related to future performance or deliverables. Other contingent-based payments received are recognized when earned.\nClinical trial expenses. We accrue clinical trial expenses based on work performed. In determining the amount to accrue, we rely on estimates of total costs incurred based on enrollment, the completion of trials and other events. We follow this method because we believe reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a clinical trial can be made. However, the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are uncertain, subject to risks and may change depending on a number of factors. Differences between the actual clinical trial costs and the estimated clinical trial costs that we have accrued in any prior period are recognized in the subsequent period in which the actual costs become known. Historically, these differences have not been material; however, material differences could occur in the future.\nAccounting for long-lived assets. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, consisting of property and equipment, and finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carry value may not be recoverable. Examples of such circumstances include: (1) loss of legal ownership or title to an asset; (2) significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets; and (3) the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. If a change were to occur in any of the above-mentioned factors the likelihood of a material change in our net loss would increase.\nIf such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, we base useful lives and amortization or depreciation expense on our subjective estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue or otherwise be used by us. The estimated fair value of the asset group is based on an estimate of the net proceeds we would receive upon disposition of the asset group to a market participant. As the estimates used are based on the best information available at the time of the estimates, additional impairment charges may be required in the future as additional facts and information become available.\nShare-based compensation. We grant equity-based awards under our share-based compensation plan and, from time to time, under inducement awards outside of our share-based compensation plan. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This fair value is then amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including price volatility of the underlying stock, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, and expected life of the option. We estimate the fair value of restricted stock unit awards based on the closing price of our common stock at the date of grant. Prior to 2017, we estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised our\nestimate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. Beginning January 1, 2017, in accordance with ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, we account for the forfeitures at the time they occur. Changes in assumptions used under the Black-Scholes option pricing model could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share.\nIncome taxes. Significant judgment is required by management to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance to record against our net deferred tax assets, which are based on complex and evolving tax regulations throughout the world. Our tax calculation is impacted by tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax and the relative amount of income earned in each jurisdiction. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized.\nThe effect of an uncertain income tax position is recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained under audit by the taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.\nThe realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. We establish a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, and includes a review of all available evidence, both positive and negative. At December 31, 2017, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized.\nThe above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report, which contain additional accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP.",

"item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. Operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods.\nThis discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual events or results may differ materially from our expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report are based on information available to us as of the time we file this Annual Report and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements. In addition, statements that we believe\u201d and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Annual Report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain.\nOVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, small molecule drugs with optimized receptor pharmacology designed to deliver clinical utility across multiple therapeutic areas. Our proprietary, internally-developed pipeline includes potentially first- or best-in-class programs.\nOur three most advanced investigational clinical programs include:\n \u2022 Ralinepag, which we are preparing for a Phase 3 program for pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, \n \u2022 Etrasimod, which is being studied in Phase 2 trials for a broad range of immune and inflammatory conditions, and \n \u2022 APD371 for a broad range of visceral pain conditions and which is being studied in a Phase 2 trial for treatment of pain associated with Crohn's disease, or CD. \nWe continue to explore additional indications for all of our clinical-stage programs. Additionally, we have collaborations with the following pharmaceutical companies:\n \u2022 Everest Medicines Limited, or Everest, in their efforts with respect to ralinepag and etrasimod in Greater China and select Asian countries, \n \u2022 Eisai Co., Ltd. and Eisai Inc., or collectively, Eisai, in their efforts with respect to BELVIQ/BELVIQ XR, which are marketed products, \n \u2022 Axovant Sciences GmbH, or Axovant, in its efforts with respect to nelotanserin, an orally available inverse agonist of the serotonin 2A receptor, which is in development for various neurological disorders, and \n \u2022 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, targeting a G protein-coupled receptor that belongs to the group of orphan central nervous system receptors, which is in preclinical development stage. \nDuring 2017, we reported positive topline Phase 2 results for ralinepag in patients with PAH and raised $236.4 million through completion of two underwritten public offerings of shares of our common stock. We also made changes to the composition of our board of directors and hired a new chief medical officer.\nOn March 9, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or Sale Agreement, with Siegfried Pharma AG and Siegfried AG (collectively and individually, Siegfried). Under the Sale Agreement, we agreed to sell and assign to Siegfried, and Siegfried agreed to purchase and assume from Arena GmbH, certain drug product finishing facility assets and know-how, including fixtures, equipment, other personal property and real estate assets located in Zofingen, Switzerland, related contracts and certain related liabilities after the closing as well as to the transfer of all of Arena GmbH's approximately 50 current employees, or collectively, Manufacturing Operations. We refer to this transaction as Siegfried Transaction. The Siegfried Transaction is expected to close on or about March 31, 2018, subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions. As a result of the Siegfried Transaction, we have excluded from our continuing operations for all periods presented in this report revenues and expenses associated with our manufacturing operations to be divested, which are reported as discontinued operations. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Manufacturing Operations.\nIn December 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Everest Agreement, with Everest. Under the Everest Agreement, we granted Everest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize two of our\nproduct candidates, ralinepag (in any formulation) and etrasimod (in oral formulations only), in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea, or the Everest Territories. Everest will be responsible for all development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed products in the Everest Territories, and may participate in the portion of our global clinical trials that is conducted in the Everest Territories. In addition to an upfront payment of $12.0 million which we collected in December 2017, we are eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments from Everest of up to $212.0 million for both licensed products, as well as tiered royalties on net sales ranging from the high single digits to low double digits. Following an initial royalty term, we are eligible to receive a lower trademark royalty if Everest continues to use our licensed product-related trademarks.\nSince 2010, a number of complaints were filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of California, or District Court, against us and certain of our current and former employees and directors on behalf of certain purchasers of our common stock. The complaints were brought as purported stockholder class actions, and, in general, include allegations that we and certain of our current and former employees and directors violated federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements regarding our BELVIQ program, thereby artificially inflating the price of our common stock. In November 2017, we and the lead plaintiff signed a stipulation and agreement of settlement, or Stipulation, to resolve the consolidated class action. Under the terms of the Stipulation, and in exchange for a release of all claims by class members and a dismissal of the consolidated class action with prejudice, we have agreed (i) our insurers will pay class members and their attorneys a total of approximately $12.025 million and (ii) Arena will pay class members and their attorneys approximately $11.975 million in either shares of our common stock or cash at our election. The terms of the settlement remain subject to preliminary approval by the District Court. If the settlement is preliminarily approved by the District Court, potential class members will be notified of the proposed settlement and the procedure by which they can become class members. The settlement will then be subject to final approval by the District Court.\nIn June 2017, we filed a certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware to effect a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report give retrospective effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented. All issued and outstanding common stock, options exercisable for common stock, restricted stock units, performance restricted stock units, and per share amounts contained in this Annual Report have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split for all periods presented. Concurrent with the reverse stock split we effected a reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 367,500,000 shares to 73,500,000 shares.\nIn general, developing drugs and obtaining marketing approval is a long, uncertain and expensive process, and our ability to execute on our plans and achieve our goals depends on numerous factors, many of which we do not control. To date, we have generated limited revenues. We expect to continue to incur substantial net losses for at least the short term as we advance our clinical development programs, and support our collaborators.\nWe plan to raise additional cash from outside sources in order to carry out our operational strategy and advance our clinical pipeline. There is no guarantee that adequate funds will be available when needed from additional debt or equity financing, development and commercialization partnerships or from other sources, or on terms acceptable to us. If our efforts to obtain sufficient additional funds are not successful, we would be required to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our research or development, manufacturing operations, administrative operations, and clinical or regulatory activities, which could negatively affect our ability to achieve certain corporate goals. We believe our cash resources are sufficient to allow us to continue operations for at least the next twelve months from the date this Annual Report is filed with the SEC.\nSee the above Business\u201d section for a more complete discussion of our business.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe are providing the following summary of our revenues, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses to supplement the more detailed discussion below. This summary excludes our revenues, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses associated with our Manufacturing Operations, which are reported within income (loss) from discontinued operations. The dollar values in the following tables are in millions.\nRevenues\n\n * The change is more than 100%. \nResearch and development expenses\n\n * The change is more than 100%. \nGeneral and administrative expenses\n\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016\nRevenues. In December 2016, we amended and restated the terms of the marketing and supply agreement for lorcaserin with Eisai by entering into a new Transaction Agreement and a new Supply Agreement (collectively, the Eisai Agreement) with Eisai. Under the Eisai Agreement, Eisai acquired global commercialization and manufacturing rights to lorcaserin, including in the territories retained by us under the prior agreement, with control over global development and commercialization decisions. Eisai is responsible for all lorcaserin development expenses going forward. We also assigned to Eisai our rights under the commercial lorcaserin distribution agreements with Ildong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Ildong, for South Korea; CY Biotech Company Limited, or CYB, for Taiwan; and Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s Israeli subsidiary, Abic Marketing Limited, or Teva, for Israel.\nPrior to the Eisai Agreement, we received from Eisai, Ildong, CYB and Teva total upfront payments of $122.5 million. Revenues from these upfront payments were previously deferred, as we determined that the exclusive rights did not have standalone value without our ongoing development and regulatory activities. Accordingly, these payments were recognized ratably as revenue over the periods in which we expected the services to be rendered. The Eisai Agreement eliminated our obligation to continue performing the development and regulatory activities required in the prior agreements. Therefore, on December 28, 2016, $64.0 million of deferred revenues from these upfront payments was allocated to the rights delivered by us to Eisai pursuant to the Eisai Agreement and recognized as revenue in 2016.\nWe recognized revenues of $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to $66.0 million of revenue recorded in 2016 from upfront payments for lorcaserin collaborations received from Eisai in prior years, and $5.7 million of revenue recorded in 2016 from upfront payments for other lorcaserin collaborations received from Ildong and CYB in prior years with no similar revenue in 2017 and a total of $12.3 million of milestones from Eisai and Ildong that we earned during 2016 primarily from the approval of the once-daily formulation of lorcaserin in the United States (branded as BELVIQ XR), the approval of the twice-daily formulation of lorcaserin in Mexico (branded as VENESPRI), and the approval of BELVIQ in Brazil. These decreases were partially offset by $12.0 million revenue in 2017 related to an upfront payment pursuant to a collaboration agreement with Everest entered into in December 2017 and $1.7 million of royalty revenue recorded in 2017 under the Eisai Agreement.\nAbsent any new collaborations, we expect our 2018 revenues will primarily consist of (i) royalty payments from Eisai based upon Eisai's sales of BELVIQ to its distributors, (ii) amortization of upfront payments we have received from our collaborators and (iii) reimbursements from collaborators for research funding.\nRevenues from royalties based on sales of BELVIQ are difficult to predict, and our overall revenues will likely vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. In the short term, we expect the amount of BELVIQ-related revenue we earn to fluctuate significantly due to the terms of the Eisai Agreement.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses, which account for the majority of our expenses, consist primarily of salaries and other personnel costs, clinical trial costs (including payments to contract research organizations, or CROs), preclinical study fees, manufacturing costs for non-commercial products, research supply costs and facility and equipment costs. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred when these expenditures have no alternative future uses. We generally do not track our earlier-stage, internal research and development expenses by project; rather, we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $7.2 million to $71.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $63.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $13.9 million in external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs partially offset by decreases of $3.7 million in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, $2.7 million in facility and equipment costs, $1.5 million in research supply costs and $1.3 million in salary and other personnel costs, primarily due to the workforce reductions in 2016.\nWe expect to incur substantial research and development expenses in 2018 and for the aggregate amount in 2018 to be potentially greater than the amount incurred in 2017. We expect our internal costs to be higher primarily due to increasing headcount related to advancing the ralinepag and etrasimod programs and we also expect to incur higher external clinical trial costs in connection with Phase 3 clinical trials for ralinepag, including patient enrollment. Our actual expenses may be higher or lower than anticipated due to various factors, including our progress and results. For example, patient enrollment in our Phase 3 clinical program for ralinepag is expected to be competitive and challenging, and could take longer than originally projected, which may result in our related external expenses being lower in 2018 than anticipated (but which might increase the overall costs for completing this multi-year program).\nIncluded in the $43.4 million of total external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs noted in the table above in this section for the year ended December 31, 2017, were the following:\n \u2022 $28.7 million related to etrasimod, \n \u2022 $9.7 million related to ralinepag, and \n \u2022 $2.8 million related to APD371. \nIncluded in the $29.5 million of total external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs noted in the table above in this section for the year ended December 31, 2016, were the following:\n \u2022 $17.6 million related to etrasimod, \n \u2022 $4.7 million related to ralinepag, \n \u2022 $4.2 million related to lorcaserin, and \n \u2022 $1.1 million related to APD371. \nCumulatively from our inception through December 31, 2017, we have recognized (i) external clinical and preclinical study fees of $307.7 million for lorcaserin, $62.2 million for etrasimod, $43.8 million for nelotanserin, $30.8 million for ralinepag and $10.3 million for APD371 and (ii) $53.0 million for non-commercial manufacturing and other development costs for lorcaserin and, to a lesser extent, nelotanserin.\nWhile expenditures on current and future clinical development programs are expected to be substantial, they are subject to many uncertainties, including whether we have adequate funds and develop our drug candidates with one or more collaborators or independently. As a result of such uncertainties, we cannot predict with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or whether, when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our drug candidates. The duration and cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development and a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 the nature and number of trials and studies in a clinical program; \n \u2022 the potential therapeutic indication; \n \u2022 the number of patients who participate in the trials; \n \u2022 the number and location of sites included in the trials; \n \u2022 the rates of patient recruitment, enrollment and withdrawal; \n \u2022 the duration of patient treatment and follow-up; \n \u2022 the costs of manufacturing drug candidates; and \n \u2022 the costs, requirements, timing of, and the ability to secure and maintain regulatory approvals. \nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to increases of $1.5 million in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, and $0.4 million in salary and other personnel costs, both primarily due to the increase in hiring activity in the latter half of 2017, an increase of $0.4 million in facility and equipment costs, and an increase of $0.4 million in legal, accounting and other professional fees. We expect that our 2018 general and administrative expenses will be higher than in 2017.\nLitigation settlement expense, net. Litigation settlement expense, net was $11.975 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This expense related to a stipulation and agreement of settlement we entered into in November 2017 in connection with a stockholder class action. The accrued amount represents the allocated value of the settlement that we will pay either in shares of our common stock or in cash, at our election. We expect this amount will be settled during the second quarter of 2018.\nRestructuring charges. We recognized $6.1 million of restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with employee termination costs, including severance and other benefits, related to the reduction of our US workforce in 2016. We incurred no similar charges in 2017.\nInterest and other expense, net. Interest and other expense, net, decreased by $3.1 million to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to (i) $0.4 million in gain on sale and disposal of equipment for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.3 million in net loss on sale and disposal of equipment for the year ended December 31, 2016, (ii) an increase of $1.0 million in rental income from additional sublease activity in 2017, and (iii) a decrease of $0.4 million in interest expense.\nDiscontinued operations. On March 9, 2018, Arena GmbH entered into the Sale Agreement with Siegfried to divest our Manufacturing Operations. The Siegfried Transaction is expected to close on or about March 31, 2018, subject to satisfaction or\nwaiver of certain customary closing conditions. As a result of the Siegfried Transaction, we have excluded from our continuing operations for all periods presented in this report revenues and expenses associated with our manufacturing operations to be divested, or Manufacturing Operations, which are reported as discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, income from discontinued operations was $3.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, loss from discontinued operations was $10.6 million. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Manufacturing Operations.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015\nRevenues. We recognized revenues of $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to (i) $66.0 million of revenue recorded in 2016 from upfront payments for lorcaserin collaborations received from Eisai, compared to $7.5 million in 2015, (ii) $5.7 million of revenue recorded in 2016 from upfront payments for other lorcaserin collaborations received from Ildong and CYB, compared to $0.5 million in 2015, (iii) a total of $12.3 million of milestones from Eisai and Ildong that we earned during 2016 primarily from the approval of the once-daily formulation of lorcaserin in the United States (branded as BELVIQ XR), the approval of the twice-daily formulation of lorcaserin in Mexico (branded as VENESPRI), and the approval of BELVIQ in Brazil, compared to $3.0 million of milestones from Ildong that we earned in February 2015 for the approval of BELVIQ in South Korea and (iv) $5.1 million earned in the year ended December 31, 2016, under our collaboration agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim, or Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement, which commenced in December 2015.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased by $19.5 million to $63.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $83.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to decreases of $11.9 million in salary and other personnel costs, $3.9 million in research supply costs, $2.0 million in facility and equipment costs, and $1.9 million in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, primarily due to the reduction in the number of our research and development employees in 2016.\nIncluded in the $29.5 million of total external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs noted in the table above in this section for the year ended December 31, 2016, were the following:\n \u2022 $17.6 million related to etrasimod, \n \u2022 $4.7 million related to ralinepag, \n \u2022 $4.2 million related to lorcaserin, and \n \u2022 $1.1 million related to APD371. \nIncluded in the $29.1 million of total external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs noted in the table above in this section for the year ended December 31, 2015, were the following:\n \u2022 $10.8 million related to lorcaserin, \n \u2022 $8.7 million related to etrasimod, \n \u2022 $5.1 million related to ralinepag, and \n \u2022 $3.5 million related to APD371. \nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by $2.8 million to $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to decreases of $2.5 million in salary and other personnel costs and $2.1 million in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, primarily due to reductions in the number of our employees in 2016 and 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in legal, accounting and other professional fees and an increase of $0.6 million in facility and equipment costs.\nRestructuring charges. We recognized $6.1 million of restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with employee termination costs, including severance and other benefits, related to the reduction of our US workforce to which we committed in June 2016. We recognized $3.3 million of restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2015, in connection with employee termination costs, including severance and other benefits, related to the workforce reductions to which we committed in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nInterest and other expense, net. Interest and other expense, net, decreased by $0.2 million to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDiscontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, loss from discontinued operations was $10.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, income from discontinued operations was $2.7 million. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Manufacturing Operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe have accumulated a large deficit since inception that has primarily resulted from the significant research and development expenditures we have made in seeking to identify and develop compounds that could become marketed drugs. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses for at least the short term.\nTo date, we have obtained cash and funded our operations to date primarily through the sale of common and preferred stock, the issuance of debt and related financial instruments, payments from collaborators and customers and sale leaseback transactions. From our inception through December 31, 2017, we have generated $2.3 billion in cash from these sources, of which $1.6 billion was through sales of equity, $560.5 million was through payments from collaborators and customers, $96.9 million was through the issuance of debt and related financial instruments and $77.1 million was from sale and leaseback transactions.\nShort term liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $271.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments. In addition to payments expected from Eisai for royalties, our other potential sources of liquidity in the short term include (i) milestone and other payments from collaborators, (ii) entering into new collaboration, licensing or commercial agreements for one or more of our drug candidates or programs, (iii) the sale or lease of our facilities or other assets and (iv) sale of equity, issuance of debt or other transactions.\nLong term liquidity.\nIt will require substantial cash to achieve our objectives of discovering, developing and commercializing drugs, and this process typically takes many years and potentially several hundreds of millions of dollars for an individual drug. We may not have adequate available cash, or assets that could be readily turned into cash, to meet these objectives in the long term. We will need to obtain significant funds under our existing collaborations, under new collaboration, licensing or other commercial agreements for one or more of our drug candidates and programs or patent portfolios, or from other potential sources of liquidity, which may include the sale of equity, issuance of debt or other transactions.\nIn addition to potential payments from our current collaborators, as well as funds from public and private financial markets, potential sources of liquidity in the long term include (i) upfront, milestone, royalty and other payments from any future collaborators or licensees and (ii) revenues from sales of any drugs we obtain regulatory approval to commercialize on our own. The length of time that our current cash and cash equivalents and any available borrowings will sustain our operations will be based on, among other things, the rate of adoption and commercial success of BELVIQ and any other drug we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval to market, regulatory decisions affecting our and our collaborator's drug candidates, prioritization decisions regarding funding for our programs, progress in our clinical and earlier-stage programs, the time and costs related to current and future clinical trials and nonclinical studies, our research, development, manufacturing and commercialization costs (including personnel costs), our progress in any programs under collaborations, costs associated with intellectual property, our capital expenditures, and costs associated with securing any in-licensing opportunities. Any significant shortfall in funding may result in us reducing our development and/or research activities, which, in turn, would affect our development pipeline and ability to obtain cash in the future.\nWe evaluate from time to time potential acquisitions, in-licensing and other opportunities. Any such transaction may impact our liquidity as well as affect our expenses if, for example, our operating expenses increase as a result of such acquisition or license or we use our cash to finance the acquisition or license.\nSources and uses of our cash.\nNet cash used in operating activities increased by $4.5 million to $66.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $62.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to (i) an increase of $13.7 million in payments made for external clinical study fees, (ii) the $10.0 million payment we received from Eisai in December 2016 in connection of the sale of bulk inventory under the Eisai Agreement, while we did not receive any similar payment in the year ended December 31, 2017, and (iii) the $7.5 million payment we received from Boehringer Ingelheim in February 2016 upon entering into the Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement. These increases in net cash used in operating activities were partially offset by (i) the $12.0 million we received from Everest in December 2017 upon entering into the collaboration agreement with Everest, (ii) an increase of $5.9 million in net payments we received from Eisai and other BELVIQ distributors, from $9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, to $15.2\nmillion (primarily consisting of $7.2 million of manufacturing support payments related to the Eisai Agreement and $5.2 million in net settlement payments related to the prior agreements) in the year ended December 31, 2017, and (iii) decreased cash expenditures of approximately $10.7 million for personnel costs primarily resulting from the workforce reductions payments in 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $36.0 million to $62.1 million, compared to $98.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to (i) the $10.0 million we received from Eisai in December 2016 pursuant to entering the Eisai Agreement, (ii) a decrease of $9.6 million in payments made for external clinical and preclinical study fees, (iii) reduced cash expenditures of approximately $9.4 million for personnel costs primarily resulting from the workforce reductions we effected at the end of 2015, in June 2016, and in July 2016, (iv) the $7.5 million payment we received from Boehringer Ingelheim, less $1.2 million of withholding taxes (which was refunded to us in October 2016), in February 2016 upon entering into the Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement, while we did not receive any similar upfront payments in the year ended December 31, 2015, and (v) reduced cash expenditures for research supply costs and facility and equipment costs primarily resulting from the workforce reductions. These decreases in net cash used in operations were partially offset by (i) the $3.0 million milestone payment we received from Ildong, less withholding taxes, in March 2015 for the marketing approval of BELVIQ in South Korea, while we did not receive any similar milestone payment in the year December 31, 2016, and (ii) net payments of $7.6 million we received for shipments of BELVIQ to Eisai and Ildong in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $10.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $111.6 million to $112.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to $112.6 million in net purchases of available-for-sale investments in the year ended December 31, 2017, while there was no similar investing activity in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to $1.0 million in purchases of property and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $11.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 including the investing activities classified as discontinued operations, partially offset by (i) a $1.3 million decrease in net proceeds from the sale of equipment and (ii) a $0.8 million increase in deposits and restricted cash in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a $0.6 million decrease in deposits and restricted cash in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash of $245.3 million was provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, as a result of net proceeds of $236.4 million from our April 2017 and July 2017 offerings of our common stock, net proceeds of $7.0 million from the sale of our common stock under our ATM facility and net proceeds of $5.4 million from stock option exercises, partially offset by $3.5 million of principal payments on our lease financing obligations. Net cash of $2.3 million was used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of $3.0 million of principal payments on our lease financing obligations, partially offset by net proceeds of $0.4 million from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and a $0.3 million security deposit received from a sublessee. Net cash of $101.1 million was provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of net proceeds of $100.7 million from our January 2015 offering of 2,100,000 shares of common stock and net proceeds of $3.0 million from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, which were partially offset by $2.5 million for principal payments on our lease financing obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, in thousands:\n\nOur financing obligations\u201d relate to sale and leaseback transactions for certain of our properties. We have applied the financing method to these sale and leaseback transactions, which requires that the book value of the properties and related accumulated depreciation remain on our balance sheet with no sale recognized. The sales price of the properties is recorded as a financing obligation and a portion of each lease payment is recorded as interest expense. At December 31, 2017, we expect interest expense over the remaining term of these leases to total $31.6 million. Other of our properties are under operating leases and are included under operating leases\u201d above.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements.\nWe do not have and did not have at December 31, 2017, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCOLLABORATIONS\nEverest.\nIn December 2017, we and Everest entered into an exclusive agreement to conduct joint development for the ralinepag and etrasimod programs. Under this agreement, we granted Everest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize ralinepag (in any formulation) and etrasimod (in oral formulations), in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea, or collectively, the Territories. Everest is generally responsible for development and commercialization of the licensed products in the Territories, and may participate in the portion of our global clinical trials that is conducted in the Territories.\nWe received from Everest an upfront payment of $12.0 million in December 2017. Revenues from this upfront payment were recognized in December 2017 as we determined (i) that the license is a deliverable with standalone value to Everest and (ii) the upfront payment represents consideration to be allocated to the delivered license.\nWe are also eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $212.0 million in success milestones in case of full commercial success of multiple drug products. Of these payments, six development milestones totaling $49.5 million are substantive, nine regulatory milestones totaling $22.5 million are substantive and six commercial milestones totaling $140.0 million are non-substantive. We are further eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of ralinepag and etrasimod products in the Territories.\nEisai.\nIn July 2010, we granted Eisai exclusive commercialization rights for lorcaserin (marketed as BELVIQ\u00ae / BELVIQ XR\u00ae) solely in the United States and its territories and possessions. In May 2012, we and Eisai entered into the first amended and restated agreement, which expanded Eisai's exclusive commercialization rights to include most of North and South America. In November 2013, we and Eisai entered into the second amended and restated agreement, or Second Amended Agreement, which expanded Eisai's exclusive commercialization rights for lorcaserin to all of the countries in the world, except for South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and Israel.\nIn December 2016, we and Eisai amended and restated the terms of marketing and supply agreement for lorcaserin with Eisai by entering into a Transaction Agreement and a Supply Agreement (collectively, the Eisai Agreement) with Eisai. Under the Transaction Agreement, Eisai acquired an exclusive royalty-bearing license or transfer of intellectual property to global commercialization and manufacturing rights to lorcaserin, including in the territories retained by us under the prior agreement, with control over global development and commercialization decisions. Eisai is responsible for all lorcaserin development expenses going forward. We also assigned to Eisai our rights under the commercial lorcaserin distribution agreements with Ildong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Ildong, for South Korea; CY Biotech Company Limited, or CYB, for Taiwan; and Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s Israeli subsidiary, Abic Marketing Limited, or Teva, for Israel. This is collectively referred to as License Deliverable.\nUnder the Supply Agreement, Eisai paid us $10.0 million to acquire our entire on-hand inventory of bulk lorcaserin and the precursor material for manufacturing lorcaserin, which is referred to as Inventory Deliverable. Eisai is also paying us for finished drug product plus up to CHF 13.0 million in manufacturing support payments over an initial two-year supply period.\nWe manufacture lorcaserin at our facility in Zofingen, Switzerland. Revenues earned for (i) lorcaserin sold by us to Eisai under the manufacturing and supply commitment within the Supply Agreement, or Manufacturing and Supply Commitment Deliverable, and formerly sold by us to Eisai, Ildong, CYB and Teva for commercial or development purposes under the prior lorcaserin collaboration agreements and (ii) the manufacturing support payments are classified within discontinued operations as part of the Manufacturing Operations on the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 5). All other revenues earned under the Transaction Agreement and the prior lorcaserin collaboration agreements, such as royalties, licenses, milestones and development expense reimbursements, are classified within continuing operations on the consolidated statements of operations.\nRoyalty payments.\nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we are eligible to receive royalty payments from Eisai based on the global net sales of lorcaserin. The royalty rates are as follows:\n \u2022 9.5% on annual net sales less than or equal to $175.0 million \n \u2022 13.5% on annual net sales greater than $175.0 million but less than or equal to $500.0 million \n \u2022 18.5% of annual net sales greater than $500.0 million \nWe record revenues from the royalty payments in the period in which the net sales upon which the royalties are calculated occur as reported to us by Eisai. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized royalty revenue of $1.7 million under the Eisai Agreement.\nUpfront payments.\nPrior to the Transaction Agreement, we received from Eisai total upfront payments of $115.0 million under prior lorcaserin collaboration agreements. Revenues from these upfront payments were previously deferred, as we determined that the exclusive rights did not have standalone value without our ongoing development and regulatory activities. Accordingly, these payments were recognized ratably as revenue over the periods in which we expected the services to be rendered. The Transaction Agreement effectively eliminated our obligation to continue performing the development and regulatory activities required in the original agreement, which resulted in acceleration of upfront payment revenue recognition in 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, we recognized revenue of $66.0 million and $7.5 million, respectively, related to these upfront payments.\nMilestone payments.\nIn July 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved the New Drug Application for BELVIQ XR. We earned from Eisai a $10.0 million substantive milestone payment from this achievement. In October 2016, Eisai announced the commercial launch of BELVIQ XR in the United States.\nIn July 2016, the Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risk approved the Marketing Authorization Application in Mexico for our twice-daily formulation of lorcaserin for chronic weight management. We earned from Eisai a $1.0 million substantive milestone payment from this achievement.\nIn December 2016, the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency provided regulatory approval in Brazil for BELVIQ. We earned from Eisai a $1.0 million substantive milestone payment from this achievement.\nWe are eligible to receive an additional substantive commercial milestone of $25.0 million upon the achievement of global net sales of lorcaserin for a calendar year first exceeding $250.0 million.\nProduct purchase price and inventory purchase.\nWe manufacture lorcaserin at our facility in Zofingen, Switzerland. Under the Eisai Agreement, we have agreed to manufacture and supply, and Eisai has agreed to purchase from us, all of Eisai's requirements (or specified minimum quantities if such quantities are greater than Eisai's requirements), subject to certain exceptions, for lorcaserin for development and commercial use for an initial two-year period. The initial period may be extended by Eisai for an additional six months upon payment of an extension fee of CHF 2.0 million. Eisai will pay us agreed upon prices to deliver finished drug product during this time. Additionally, Eisai has agreed to pay up to CHF 13.0 million in manufacturing support payments during the initial two-year period supply period, and pay up to CHF 6.0 million in manufacturing support payments during the six-month extension period, if the extension option is exercised by Eisai.\nUnder the Second Amended Agreement, we sold lorcaserin to Eisai for Eisai's commercialization in the United States for a purchase price of 31.5% of Eisai's aggregate annual net product sales (which are the gross invoiced sales less certain deductions described in the Second Amended Agreement), or the Product Purchase Price. The amount that Eisai paid us for lorcaserin product supply was based on Eisai's estimated price at the time the order was shipped, which was Eisai's estimate of the Eisai Product Purchase Price, and was subject to change on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Eisai Product Purchase Price for the product Eisai sold under the Second Amended Agreement was lower than the estimated price that Eisai paid us for such product, primarily due to an increase in deductions from savings cards and returns, partially offset by a decrease in vouchers. At the end of Eisai's fiscal year (March 31), the estimated price paid to us for product that Eisai sold to its distributors was compared to the Eisai Product Purchase Price of such product, and the difference was refunded back to Eisai for the overpayments. The $9.1 million classified as Payable to Eisai within the total liabilities of disposal group held for sale at December 31, 2016, relates to product sold by Eisai to its distributors from April 1, 2015, through March 31, 2016. Under the Eisai Agreement, we were not required to refund to Eisai any net overpayment which would have been otherwise due to Eisai under the Second Amended Agreement for product we sold to Eisai under the Second Amended Agreement which Eisai did not sell to its distributors on or before March 31, 2016. For product which Eisai sold to its distributors from April 1, 2016, through December 28, 2016, we recognized the net overpayment which would have been otherwise due to Eisai under the Second Amended Agreement of $2.0 million as revenues and included this amount in net product sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is a component of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations.\nPrior to December 2016, we deferred recognition of revenue and the related cost at the time we sold lorcaserin to Eisai because we did not have the ability to estimate the amount of product that could have been returned to us and thus recognized revenues and the related costs from net product sales when Eisai shipped BELVIQ to its distributors. Pursuant to a change in the terms of the Eisai Agreement, we determined that we achieved the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of product returns and recognize revenue and the related cost from product sales when we ship BELVIQ to Eisai. On December 28, 2016, we recognized revenues of $6.7 million and costs of $1.9 million on net product sales which had been previously deferred, which is a component of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations.\nAllocation of Eisai Agreement arrangement consideration to the units of accounting.\nThe total arrangement consideration of $115.6 million primarily consists of (i) the December 28, 2016, balances of deferred revenues from the upfront payments received under the prior Eisai agreements and the distribution agreements with Ildong, CYB and Teva; (ii) the $10.0 million payment received from Eisai on December 28, 2016; and (iii) the product purchase payments and manufacturing support payments we expect to receive from Eisai for the initial two-year manufacturing and supply commitment period.\nAll of the deliverables were determined to have standalone value and to meet the criteria to be accounted for as separate units of accounting. Factors considered in the determination included, among other things, for the license, the manufacturing experience and capabilities of Eisai and their sublicense rights, and for the remaining deliverables the fact that they are not proprietary and can be provided by other vendors. The total arrangement consideration was allocated to the units of accounting on the basis of their relative estimated selling prices as follows:\n \u2022 $64.0 million was allocated to the License Deliverable. As the License Deliverable was delivered on December 28, 2016, this amount was recognized as collaboration revenue of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 $30.8 million was allocated to the Inventory Deliverable. Title to this entire inventory passed to Eisai on December 28, 2016. However, none of this inventory was physically transferred from the manufacturing facility on that date. There is no fixed schedule for delivery given a portion has been and will be delivered on a continuous basis as we perform under the manufacturing commitment, another portion has been and will be physically transferred to Eisai upon request by Eisai and the rest is expected to be physically transferred at the end of the manufacturing and supply commitment period. Also, the risks of ownership for this inventory did not pass to Eisai in 2016 as we have financial responsibility for loss, damage or destruction which occurs while in our possession. Therefore, none of the arrangement consideration allocated to this deliverable was recognized as revenue and none of the carrying value of this inventory was recognized as cost of product sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $6.4 million as \n revenue of discontinued operations related to this deliverable and $0.9 million of the carrying value of this inventory as cost of product sales of discontinued operations. \n \u2022 $20.8 million was allocated to the Manufacturing and Supply Commitment Deliverable. This deliverable is being provided over 2017 and 2018 as product is shipped to Eisai. Therefore, none of the arrangement consideration allocated to this deliverable was recognized as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $9.5 million as revenue of discontinued operations related to this deliverable. \nThe estimated selling price represents the price at which we would contract if the deliverable was sold regularly on a standalone basis. The estimated selling price for each unit of accounting was determined as follows:\n \u2022 The estimated selling price for the License Deliverable was determined using an income approach that estimates the net present value of royalties Eisai is expected to earn under the Eisai Agreement as compared to the Second Amended Agreement, net of the development costs we are no longer obligated to spend. This model includes several assumptions, including the potential market for lorcaserin in each relevant jurisdiction, probabilities of obtaining regulatory approval in additional jurisdictions, the impact of competition, the potential impact of Eisai's ongoing development and regulatory activities related to lorcaserin, and the appropriate discount rate. \n \u2022 The estimated selling price for the Inventory Deliverable was determined by considering the historical cost of the precursor materials, adjusted for any changes in market condition and supplier relationships. We believe that the Eisai Agreement pricing represents pricing that would be charged if it were sold on a standalone basis. \n \u2022 The estimated selling price for the Manufacturing and Supply Commitment Deliverable was determined to be the aggregate product purchase payments we expect to receive from Eisai for the initial two-year manufacturing and supply commitment period. As noted above, we believe that the Eisai Agreement pricing represents pricing that would be charged if it were sold on a standalone basis. \nDevelopment payments.\nAs part of the US approval of BELVIQ, the FDA, is requiring the evaluation of the effect of long-term treatment with BELVIQ on the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, or MACE, in overweight and obese patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors (which is the FDA-required portion of the cardiovascular outcomes trial), as well as the conduct of postmarketing studies to assess the safety and efficacy of BELVIQ for weight management in obese pediatric and adolescent patients. Under the Second Amended Agreement, Eisai and we were responsible for 90% and 10%, respectively, of the cost for the FDA-required portion of the cardiovascular outcomes trial, or CVOT, 50% and 50%, respectively, of the non-FDA portion of the studies and we were also obligated to share the cost of FDA-required studies in obese pediatric patients and for additional clinical studies in other territories.\nUnder the Eisai Agreement, Eisai is solely responsible for all costs and expenses in connection with further development of lorcaserin from and after July 1, 2016, and we were relieved of any obligations under the Second Amended Agreement to pay our share of future development costs of lorcaserin. Accordingly, on December 28, 2016, we recorded a reduction of research and development expenses which would have been otherwise due to Eisai under the Second Amended Agreement of $3.7 million for the period from July 1, 2016, through December 28, 2016.\nDecember 31, 2016, and 2015, we recognized expenses of $4.2 million, and $10.8 million, respectively, for external clinical study fees related to lorcaserin, which are included in continuing operations. There were no such expenses in 2017. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 we recognized expenses of $1.4 million, $3.1 million, and $5.4 million, respectively for internal non-commercial manufacturing costs primarily related to lorcaserin, which are included in discontinued operations.\nIldong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\nIn November 2012, we and Ildong entered into the Marketing and Supply Agreement, or Ildong Agreement. Under this agreement, we granted Ildong exclusive rights to commercialize BELVIQ in South Korea for weight loss or weight management in obese and overweight patients. We also provided certain services and manufacture and sold BELVIQ to Ildong. As noted above, the Ildong Agreement was assigned to Eisai pursuant to the Eisai Agreement on December 28, 2016.\nIn connection with entering into the Ildong Agreement, we received from Ildong an upfront payment of $5.0 million, less withholding taxes. Revenues from this upfront payment were deferred, as we determined that the exclusive rights did not have standalone value without our ongoing development and regulatory activities. Accordingly, this payment was recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which we expected the services to be rendered. The assignment of the Ildong Agreement pursuant to the\nEisai Agreement effectively eliminated our obligation to continue performing the development and regulatory activities required in the Ildong Agreement. Therefore, on December 28, 2016, the $3.5 million of deferred revenues from this upfront payment was allocated to the value of the License provided to Eisai and recognized as revenue in 2016.\nIn February 2015, we earned a substantive milestone payment of $3.0 million upon the approval of BELVIQ for marketing in South Korea for weight management. We received the payment, less withholding taxes, in March 2015.\nUnder the Ildong Agreement, we manufactured BELVIQ at our facility in Zofingen, Switzerland, and sold BELVIQ to Ildong for a purchase price starting at the higher of the defined minimum amount or 35% of Ildong's annual net product sales (which are the gross invoiced sales less certain deductions described in the Ildong Agreement), or the Ildong Product Purchase Price. The Ildong Product Purchase Price increased on a tiered basis up to the higher of the defined minimum amount or 45% on the portion of annual net product sales exceeding $15.0 million. Since the inception of commercial sales of BELVIQ in South Korea in 2015, the Ildong Product Purchase Price equaled the defined minimum amount (which exceeded the amounts calculated using the applicable percentages for the applicable tiers of Ildong's annual net product sales).\nPrior to December 2016, we deferred recognition of revenue and the related cost at the time we sold BELVIQ to Ildong because we did not have the ability to estimate the amount of product that could have been returned to us and thus recognized revenues and the related costs from net product sales when Ildong shipped BELVIQ to its distributors. In December 2016, we determined that we achieved the ability to reasonably estimate product returns under the Ildong Agreement. Accordingly, we recognized revenues of $2.0 million and costs of $0.7 million in December 2016 on net product sales which had been previously deferred, which is a component of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenues of $11.4 million and $8.9 million, respectively, under the Ildong agreement, of which $7.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively are included in discontinued operations. No revenues were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 under this agreement.\nCY Biotech Company Limited.\nIn July 2013, we entered into the CYB Agreement. Under this agreement, we granted CYB exclusive rights to commercialize BELVIQ in Taiwan for weight loss or weight management", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Our proprietary, internally-developed pipeline includes potentially first- or best-in-class programs.\nOur three most advanced investigational clinical programs include:\n \u2022 Ralinepag, which we are preparing for a Phase 3 program for pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, \n \u2022 Etrasimod, which is being studied in Phase 2 trials for a broad range of immune and inflammatory conditions, and \n \u2022 APD371 for a broad range of visceral pain conditions and which is being studied in a Phase 2 trial for treatment of pain associated with Crohn's disease, or CD. \nWe continue to explore additional indications for all of our clinical-stage programs. Additionally, we have collaborations with the following pharmaceutical companies:\n \u2022 Everest Medicines Limited, or Everest, in their efforts with respect to ralinepag and etrasimod in Greater China and select Asian countries, \n \u2022 Eisai Co., Ltd. and Eisai Inc., or collectively, Eisai, in their efforts with respect to BELVIQ/BELVIQ XR, which are marketed products, \n \u2022 Axovant Sciences GmbH, or Axovant, in its efforts with respect to nelotanserin, an orally available inverse agonist of the serotonin 2A receptor, which is in development for various neurological disorders, and \n \u2022 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, targeting a G protein-coupled receptor that belongs to the group of orphan central nervous system receptors, which is in preclinical development stage. \nDuring 2017, we reported positive topline Phase 2 results for ralinepag in patients with PAH and raised $236.4 million through completion of two underwritten public offerings of shares of our common stock. We also made changes to the composition of our board of directors and hired a new chief medical officer.\nOn March 9, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or Sale Agreement, with Siegfried Pharma AG and Siegfried AG (collectively and individually, Siegfried). Under the Sale Agreement, we agreed to sell and assign to Siegfried, and Siegfried agreed to purchase and assume from Arena GmbH, certain drug product finishing facility assets and know-how, including fixtures, equipment, other personal property and real estate assets located in Zofingen, Switzerland, related contracts and certain related liabilities after the closing as well as to the transfer of all of Arena GmbH's approximately 50 current employees, or collectively, Manufacturing Operations. We refer to this transaction as Siegfried Transaction. The Siegfried Transaction is expected to close on or about March 31, 2018, subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions. As a result of the Siegfried Transaction, we have excluded from our continuing operations for all periods presented in this report revenues and expenses associated with our manufacturing operations to be divested, which are reported as discontinued operations. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Manufacturing Operations.\nIn December 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Everest Agreement, with Everest. Under the Everest Agreement, we granted Everest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize two of our\nproduct candidates, ralinepag (in any formulation) and etrasimod (in oral formulations only), in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea, or the Everest Territories. Everest will be responsible for all development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed products in the Everest Territories, and may participate in the portion of our global clinical trials that is conducted in the Everest Territories. In addition to an upfront payment of $12.0 million which we collected in December 2017, we are eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments from Everest of up to $212.0 million for both licensed products, as well as tiered royalties on net sales ranging from the high single digits to low double digits. Following an initial royalty term, we are eligible to receive a lower trademark royalty if Everest continues to use our licensed product-related trademarks.\nSince 2010, a number of complaints were filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of California, or District Court, against us and certain of our current and former employees and directors on behalf of certain purchasers of our common stock. The complaints were brought as purported stockholder class actions, and, in general, include allegations that we and certain of our current and former employees and directors violated federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements regarding our BELVIQ program, thereby artificially inflating the price of our common stock. In November 2017, we and the lead plaintiff signed a stipulation and agreement of settlement, or Stipulation, to resolve the consolidated class action. Under the terms of the Stipulation, and in exchange for a release of all claims by class members and a dismissal of the consolidated class action with prejudice, we have agreed (i) our insurers will pay class members and their attorneys a total of approximately $12.025 million and (ii) Arena will pay class members and their attorneys approximately $11.975 million in either shares of our common stock or cash at our election. The terms of the settlement remain subject to preliminary approval by the District Court. If the settlement is preliminarily approved by the District Court, potential class members will be notified of the proposed settlement and the procedure by which they can become class members. The settlement will then be subject to final approval by the District Court.\nIn June 2017, we filed a certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware to effect a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report give retrospective effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented. All issued and outstanding common stock, options exercisable for common stock, restricted stock units, performance restricted stock units, and per share amounts contained in this Annual Report have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split for all periods presented. Concurrent with the reverse stock split we effected a reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 367,500,000 shares to 73,500,000 shares.\nIn general, developing drugs and obtaining marketing approval is a long, uncertain and expensive process, and our ability to execute on our plans and achieve our goals depends on numerous factors, many of which we do not control. To date, we have generated limited revenues. We expect to continue to incur substantial net losses for at least the short term as we advance our clinical development programs, and support our collaborators.\nWe plan to raise additional cash from outside sources in order to carry out our operational strategy and advance our clinical pipeline. There is no guarantee that adequate funds will be available when needed from additional debt or equity financing, development and commercialization partnerships or from other sources, or on terms acceptable to us. If our efforts to obtain sufficient additional funds are not successful, we would be required to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our research or development, manufacturing operations, administrative operations, and clinical or regulatory activities, which could negatively affect our ability to achieve certain corporate goals. We believe our cash resources are sufficient to allow us to continue operations for at least the next twelve months from the date this Annual Report is filed with the SEC.\nSee the above Business\u201d section for a more complete discussion of our business.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe are providing the following summary of our revenues, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses to supplement the more detailed discussion below. This summary excludes our revenues, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses associated with our Manufacturing Operations, which are reported within income (loss) from discontinued operations.

In December 2016, we amended and restated the terms of the marketing and supply agreement for lorcaserin with Eisai by entering into a new Transaction Agreement and a new Supply Agreement (collectively, the Eisai Agreement) with Eisai. Under the Eisai Agreement, Eisai acquired global commercialization and manufacturing rights to lorcaserin, including in the territories retained by us under the prior agreement, with control over global development and commercialization decisions. Eisai is responsible for all lorcaserin development expenses going forward. We also assigned to Eisai our rights under the commercial lorcaserin distribution agreements with Ildong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Ildong, for South Korea; CY Biotech Company Limited, or CYB, for Taiwan; and Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s Israeli subsidiary, Abic Marketing Limited, or Teva, for Israel.\nPrior to the Eisai Agreement, we received from Eisai, Ildong, CYB and Teva total upfront payments of $122.5 million. Revenues from these upfront payments were previously deferred, as we determined that the exclusive rights did not have standalone value without our ongoing development and regulatory activities. Accordingly, these payments were recognized ratably as revenue over the periods in which we expected the services to be rendered. The Eisai Agreement eliminated our obligation to continue performing the development and regulatory activities required in the prior agreements. Therefore, on December 28, 2016, $64.0 million of deferred revenues from these upfront payments was allocated to the rights delivered by us to Eisai pursuant to the Eisai Agreement and recognized as revenue in 2016.\nWe recognized revenues of $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to $66.0 million of revenue recorded in 2016 from upfront payments for lorcaserin collaborations received from Eisai in prior years, and $5.7 million of revenue recorded in 2016 from upfront payments for other lorcaserin collaborations received from Ildong and CYB in prior years with no similar revenue in 2017 and a total of $12.3 million of milestones from Eisai and Ildong that we earned during 2016 primarily from the approval of the once-daily formulation of lorcaserin in the United States (branded as BELVIQ XR), the approval of the twice-daily formulation of lorcaserin in Mexico (branded as VENESPRI), and the approval of BELVIQ in Brazil. These decreases were partially offset by $12.0 million revenue in 2017 related to an upfront payment pursuant to a collaboration agreement with Everest entered into in December 2017 and $1.7 million of royalty revenue recorded in 2017 under the Eisai Agreement.\nAbsent any new collaborations, we expect our 2018 revenues will primarily consist of (i) royalty payments from Eisai based upon Eisai's sales of BELVIQ to its distributors, (ii) amortization of upfront payments we have received from our collaborators and (iii) reimbursements from collaborators for research funding.\nRevenues from royalties based on sales of BELVIQ are difficult to predict, and our overall revenues will likely vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. In the short term, we expect the amount of BELVIQ-related revenue we earn to fluctuate significantly due to the terms of the Eisai Agreement.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses, which account for the majority of our expenses, consist primarily of salaries and other personnel costs, clinical trial costs (including payments to contract research organizations, or CROs), preclinical study fees, manufacturing costs for non-commercial products, research supply costs and facility and equipment costs. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred when these expenditures have no alternative future uses. We generally do not track our earlier-stage, internal research and development expenses by project; rather, we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $7.2 million to $71.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $63.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $13.9 million in external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs partially offset by decreases of $3.7 million in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, $2.7 million in facility and equipment costs, $1.5 million in research supply costs and $1.3 million in salary and other personnel costs, primarily due to the workforce reductions in 2016.\nWe expect to incur substantial research and development expenses in 2018 and for the aggregate amount in 2018 to be potentially greater than the amount incurred in 2017. We expect our internal costs to be higher primarily due to increasing headcount related to advancing the ralinepag and etrasimod programs and we also expect to incur higher external clinical trial costs in connection with Phase 3 clinical trials for ralinepag, including patient enrollment. Our actual expenses may be higher or lower than anticipated due to various factors, including our progress and results. For example, patient enrollment in our Phase 3 clinical program for ralinepag is expected to be competitive and challenging, and could take longer than originally projected, which may result in our related external expenses being lower in 2018 than anticipated (but which might increase the overall costs for completing this multi-year program).\nIncluded in the $43.4 million of total external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs noted in the table above in this section for the year ended December 31, 2017, were the following:\n \u2022 $28.7 million related to etrasimod, \n \u2022 $9.7 million related to ralinepag, and \n \u2022 $2.8 million related to APD371. \nIncluded in the $29.5 million of total external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs noted in the table above in this section for the year ended December 31, 2016, were the following:\n \u2022 $17.6 million related to etrasimod, \n \u2022 $4.7 million related to ralinepag, \n \u2022 $4.2 million related to lorcaserin, and \n \u2022 $1.1 million related to APD371. \nCumulatively from our inception through December 31, 2017, we have recognized (i) external clinical and preclinical study fees of $307.7 million for lorcaserin, $62.2 million for etrasimod, $43.8 million for nelotanserin, $30.8 million for ralinepag and $10.3 million for APD371 and (ii) $53.0 million for non-commercial manufacturing and other development costs for lorcaserin and, to a lesser extent, nelotanserin.\nWhile expenditures on current and future clinical development programs are expected to be substantial, they are subject to many uncertainties, including whether we have adequate funds and develop our drug candidates with one or more collaborators or independently. As a result of such uncertainties, we cannot predict with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or whether, when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our drug candidates. The duration and cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development and a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 the nature and number of trials and studies in a clinical program; \n \u2022 the potential therapeutic indication; \n \u2022 the number of patients who participate in the trials; \n \u2022 the number and location of sites included in the trials; \n \u2022 the rates of patient recruitment, enrollment and withdrawal; \n \u2022 the duration of patient treatment and follow-up; \n \u2022 the costs of manufacturing drug candidates; and \n \u2022 the costs, requirements, timing of, and the ability to secure and maintain regulatory approvals. \nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to increases of $1.5 million in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, and $0.4 million in salary and other personnel costs, both primarily due to the increase in hiring activity in the latter half of 2017, an increase of $0.4 million in facility and equipment costs, and an increase of $0.4 million in legal, accounting and other professional fees. We expect that our 2018 general and administrative expenses will be higher than in 2017.\nLitigation settlement expense, net. Litigation settlement expense, net was $11.975 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This expense related to a stipulation and agreement of settlement we entered into in November 2017 in connection with a stockholder class action. The accrued amount represents the allocated value of the settlement that we will pay either in shares of our common stock or in cash, at our election. We expect this amount will be settled during the second quarter of 2018.\nRestructuring charges. We recognized $6.1 million of restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with employee termination costs, including severance and other benefits, related to the reduction of our US workforce in 2016. We incurred no similar charges in 2017.\nInterest and other expense, net. Interest and other expense, net, decreased by $3.1 million to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to (i) $0.4 million in gain on sale and disposal of equipment for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.3 million in net loss on sale and disposal of equipment for the year ended December 31, 2016, (ii) an increase of $1.0 million in rental income from additional sublease activity in 2017, and (iii) a decrease of $0.4 million in interest expense.\nDiscontinued operations. On March 9, 2018, Arena GmbH entered into the Sale Agreement with Siegfried to divest our Manufacturing Operations. The Siegfried Transaction is expected to close on or about March 31, 2018, subject to satisfaction or\nwaiver of certain customary closing conditions. As a result of the Siegfried Transaction, we have excluded from our continuing operations for all periods presented in this report revenues and expenses associated with our manufacturing operations to be divested, or Manufacturing Operations, which are reported as discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, income from discontinued operations was $3.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, loss from discontinued operations was $10.6 million. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Manufacturing Operations.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015\nRevenues. We recognized revenues of $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to (i) $66.0 million of revenue recorded in 2016 from upfront payments for lorcaserin collaborations received from Eisai, compared to $7.5 million in 2015, (ii) $5.7 million of revenue recorded in 2016 from upfront payments for other lorcaserin collaborations received from Ildong and CYB, compared to $0.5 million in 2015, (iii) a total of $12.3 million of milestones from Eisai and Ildong that we earned during 2016 primarily from the approval of the once-daily formulation of lorcaserin in the United States (branded as BELVIQ XR), the approval of the twice-daily formulation of lorcaserin in Mexico (branded as VENESPRI), and the approval of BELVIQ in Brazil, compared to $3.0 million of milestones from Ildong that we earned in February 2015 for the approval of BELVIQ in South Korea and (iv) $5.1 million earned in the year ended December 31, 2016, under our collaboration agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim, or Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement, which commenced in December 2015.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased by $19.5 million to $63.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $83.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to decreases of $11.9 million in salary and other personnel costs, $3.9 million in research supply costs, $2.0 million in facility and equipment costs, and $1.9 million in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, primarily due to the reduction in the number of our research and development employees in 2016.\nIncluded in the $29.5 million of total external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs noted in the table above in this section for the year ended December 31, 2016, were the following:\n \u2022 $17.6 million related to etrasimod, \n \u2022 $4.7 million related to ralinepag, \n \u2022 $4.2 million related to lorcaserin, and \n \u2022 $1.1 million related to APD371. \nIncluded in the $29.1 million of total external clinical and preclinical study fees and internal non-commercial manufacturing costs noted in the table above in this section for the year ended December 31, 2015, were the following:\n \u2022 $10.8 million related to lorcaserin, \n \u2022 $8.7 million related to etrasimod, \n \u2022 $5.1 million related to ralinepag, and \n \u2022 $3.5 million related to APD371. \nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by $2.8 million to $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to decreases of $2.5 million in salary and other personnel costs and $2.1 million in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, primarily due to reductions in the number of our employees in 2016 and 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in legal, accounting and other professional fees and an increase of $0.6 million in facility and equipment costs.\nRestructuring charges. We recognized $6.1 million of restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with employee termination costs, including severance and other benefits, related to the reduction of our US workforce to which we committed in June 2016. We recognized $3.3 million of restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2015, in connection with employee termination costs, including severance and other benefits, related to the workforce reductions to which we committed in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nInterest and other expense, net. Interest and other expense, net, decreased by $0.2 million to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDiscontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, loss from discontinued operations was $10.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, income from discontinued operations was $2.7 million. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Manufacturing Operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe have accumulated a large deficit since inception that has primarily resulted from the significant research and development expenditures we have made in seeking to identify and develop compounds that could become marketed drugs. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses for at least the short term.\nTo date, we have obtained cash and funded our operations to date primarily through the sale of common and preferred stock, the issuance of debt and related financial instruments, payments from collaborators and customers and sale leaseback transactions. From our inception through December 31, 2017, we have generated $2.3 billion in cash from these sources, of which $1.6 billion was through sales of equity, $560.5 million was through payments from collaborators and customers, $96.9 million was through the issuance of debt and related financial instruments and $77.1 million was from sale and leaseback transactions.\nShort term liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $271.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments. In addition to payments expected from Eisai for royalties, our other potential sources of liquidity in the short term include (i) milestone and other payments from collaborators, (ii) entering into new collaboration, licensing or commercial agreements for one or more of our drug candidates or programs, (iii) the sale or lease of our facilities or other assets and (iv) sale of equity, issuance of debt or other transactions.\nLong term liquidity.\nIt will require substantial cash to achieve our objectives of discovering, developing and commercializing drugs, and this process typically takes many years and potentially several hundreds of millions of dollars for an individual drug. We may not have adequate available cash, or assets that could be readily turned into cash, to meet these objectives in the long term. We will need to obtain significant funds under our existing collaborations, under new collaboration, licensing or other commercial agreements for one or more of our drug candidates and programs or patent portfolios, or from other potential sources of liquidity, which may include the sale of equity, issuance of debt or other transactions.\nIn addition to potential payments from our current collaborators, as well as funds from public and private financial markets, potential sources of liquidity in the long term include (i) upfront, milestone, royalty and other payments from any future collaborators or licensees and (ii) revenues from sales of any drugs we obtain regulatory approval to commercialize on our own. The length of time that our current cash and cash equivalents and any available borrowings will sustain our operations will be based on, among other things, the rate of adoption and commercial success of BELVIQ and any other drug we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval to market, regulatory decisions affecting our and our collaborator's drug candidates, prioritization decisions regarding funding for our programs, progress in our clinical and earlier-stage programs, the time and costs related to current and future clinical trials and nonclinical studies, our research, development, manufacturing and commercialization costs (including personnel costs), our progress in any programs under collaborations, costs associated with intellectual property, our capital expenditures, and costs associated with securing any in-licensing opportunities. Any significant shortfall in funding may result in us reducing our development and/or research activities, which, in turn, would affect our development pipeline and ability to obtain cash in the future.\nWe evaluate from time to time potential acquisitions, in-licensing and other opportunities. Any such transaction may impact our liquidity as well as affect our expenses if, for example, our operating expenses increase as a result of such acquisition or license or we use our cash to finance the acquisition or license.\nSources and uses of our cash.\nNet cash used in operating activities increased by $4.5 million to $66.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $62.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to (i) an increase of $13.7 million in payments made for external clinical study fees, (ii) the $10.0 million payment we received from Eisai in December 2016 in connection of the sale of bulk inventory under the Eisai Agreement, while we did not receive any similar payment in the year ended December 31, 2017, and (iii) the $7.5 million payment we received from Boehringer Ingelheim in February 2016 upon entering into the Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement. These increases in net cash used in operating activities were partially offset by (i) the $12.0 million we received from Everest in December 2017 upon entering into the collaboration agreement with Everest, (ii) an increase of $5.9 million in net payments we received from Eisai and other BELVIQ distributors, from $9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, to $15.2\nmillion (primarily consisting of $7.2 million of manufacturing support payments related to the Eisai Agreement and $5.2 million in net settlement payments related to the prior agreements) in the year ended December 31, 2017, and (iii) decreased cash expenditures of approximately $10.7 million for personnel costs primarily resulting from the workforce reductions payments in 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $36.0 million to $62.1 million, compared to $98.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to (i) the $10.0 million we received from Eisai in December 2016 pursuant to entering the Eisai Agreement, (ii) a decrease of $9.6 million in payments made for external clinical and preclinical study fees, (iii) reduced cash expenditures of approximately $9.4 million for personnel costs primarily resulting from the workforce reductions we effected at the end of 2015, in June 2016, and in July 2016, (iv) the $7.5 million payment we received from Boehringer Ingelheim, less $1.2 million of withholding taxes (which was refunded to us in October 2016), in February 2016 upon entering into the Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement, while we did not receive any similar upfront payments in the year ended December 31, 2015, and (v) reduced cash expenditures for research supply costs and facility and equipment costs primarily resulting from the workforce reductions. These decreases in net cash used in operations were partially offset by (i) the $3.0 million milestone payment we received from Ildong, less withholding taxes, in March 2015 for the marketing approval of BELVIQ in South Korea, while we did not receive any similar milestone payment in the year December 31, 2016, and (ii) net payments of $7.6 million we received for shipments of BELVIQ to Eisai and Ildong in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $10.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $111.6 million to $112.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to $112.6 million in net purchases of available-for-sale investments in the year ended December 31, 2017, while there was no similar investing activity in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to $1.0 million in purchases of property and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $11.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 including the investing activities classified as discontinued operations, partially offset by (i) a $1.3 million decrease in net proceeds from the sale of equipment and (ii) a $0.8 million increase in deposits and restricted cash in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a $0.6 million decrease in deposits and restricted cash in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash of $245.3 million was provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, as a result of net proceeds of $236.4 million from our April 2017 and July 2017 offerings of our common stock, net proceeds of $7.0 million from the sale of our common stock under our ATM facility and net proceeds of $5.4 million from stock option exercises, partially offset by $3.5 million of principal payments on our lease financing obligations. Net cash of $2.3 million was used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of $3.0 million of principal payments on our lease financing obligations, partially offset by net proceeds of $0.4 million from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and a $0.3 million security deposit received from a sublessee. Net cash of $101.1 million was provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of net proceeds of $100.7 million from our January 2015 offering of 2,100,000 shares of common stock and net proceeds of $3.0 million from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, which were partially offset by $2.5 million for principal payments on our lease financing obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, in thousands:\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 83,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur financing obligations\u201d relate to sale and leaseback transactions for certain of our properties. We have applied the financing method to these sale and leaseback transactions, which requires that the book value of the properties and related accumulated depreciation remain on our balance sheet with no sale recognized. The sales price of the properties is recorded as a financing obligation and a portion of each lease payment is recorded as interest expense. At December 31, 2017, we expect interest expense over the remaining term of these leases to total $31.6 million. Other of our properties are under operating leases and are included under operating leases\u201d above.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements.\nWe do not have and did not have at December 31, 2017, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCOLLABORATIONS\nEverest.\nIn December 2017, we and Everest entered into an exclusive agreement to conduct joint development for the ralinepag and etrasimod programs. Under this agreement, we granted Everest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize ralinepag (in any formulation) and etrasimod (in oral formulations), in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea, or collectively, the Territories. Everest is generally responsible for development and commercialization of the licensed products in the Territories, and may participate in the portion of our global clinical trials that is conducted in the Territories.\nWe received from Everest an upfront payment of $12.0 million in December 2017. Revenues from this upfront payment were recognized in December 2017 as we determined (i) that the license is a deliverable with standalone value to Everest and (ii) the upfront payment represents consideration to be allocated to the delivered license.\nWe are also eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $212.0 million in success milestones in case of full commercial success of multiple drug products. Of these payments, six development milestones totaling $49.5 million are substantive, nine regulatory milestones totaling $22.5 million are substantive and six commercial milestones totaling $140.0 million are non-substantive. We are further eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of ralinepag and etrasimod products in the Territories.\nEisai.\nIn July 2010, we granted Eisai exclusive commercialization rights for lorcaserin (marketed as BELVIQ\u00ae / BELVIQ XR\u00ae) solely in the United States and its territories and possessions. In May 2012, we and Eisai entered into the first amended and restated agreement, which expanded Eisai's exclusive commercialization rights to include most of North and South America. In November 2013, we and Eisai entered into the second amended and restated agreement, or Second Amended Agreement, which expanded Eisai's exclusive commercialization rights for lorcaserin to all of the countries in the world, except for South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and Israel.\nIn December 2016, we and Eisai amended and restated the terms of marketing and supply agreement for lorcaserin with Eisai by entering into a Transaction Agreement and a Supply Agreement (collectively, the Eisai Agreement) with Eisai. Under the Transaction Agreement, Eisai acquired an exclusive royalty-bearing license or transfer of intellectual property to global commercialization and manufacturing rights to lorcaserin, including in the territories retained by us under the prior agreement, with control over global development and commercialization decisions. Eisai is responsible for all lorcaserin development expenses going forward. We also assigned to Eisai our rights under the commercial lorcaserin distribution agreements with Ildong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Ildong, for South Korea; CY Biotech Company Limited, or CYB, for Taiwan; and Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s Israeli subsidiary, Abic Marketing Limited, or Teva, for Israel. This is collectively referred to as License Deliverable.\nUnder the Supply Agreement, Eisai paid us $10.0 million to acquire our entire on-hand inventory of bulk lorcaserin and the precursor material for manufacturing lorcaserin, which is referred to as Inventory Deliverable. Eisai is also paying us for finished drug product plus up to CHF 13.0 million in manufacturing support payments over an initial two-year supply period.\nWe manufacture lorcaserin at our facility in Zofingen, Switzerland. Revenues earned for (i) lorcaserin sold by us to Eisai under the manufacturing and supply commitment within the Supply Agreement, or Manufacturing and Supply Commitment Deliverable, and formerly sold by us to Eisai, Ildong, CYB and Teva for commercial or development purposes under the prior lorcaserin collaboration agreements and (ii) the manufacturing support payments are classified within discontinued operations as part of the Manufacturing Operations on the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 5). All other revenues earned under the Transaction Agreement and the prior lorcaserin collaboration agreements, such as royalties, licenses, milestones and development expense reimbursements, are classified within continuing operations on the consolidated statements of operations.\nRoyalty payments.\nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we are eligible to receive royalty payments from Eisai based on the global net sales of lorcaserin. The royalty rates are as follows:\n \u2022 9.5% on annual net sales less than or equal to $175.0 million \n \u2022 13.5% on annual net sales greater than $175.0 million but less than or equal to $500.0 million \n \u2022 18.5% of annual net sales greater than $500.0 million \nWe record revenues from the royalty payments in the period in which the net sales upon which the royalties are calculated occur as reported to us by Eisai. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized royalty revenue of $1.7 million under the Eisai Agreement.\nUpfront payments.\nPrior to the Transaction Agreement, we received from Eisai total upfront payments of $115.0 million under prior lorcaserin collaboration agreements. Revenues from these upfront payments were previously deferred, as we determined that the exclusive rights did not have standalone value without our ongoing development and regulatory activities. Accordingly, these payments were recognized ratably as revenue over the periods in which we expected the services to be rendered. The Transaction Agreement effectively eliminated our obligation to continue performing the development and regulatory activities required in the original agreement, which resulted in acceleration of upfront payment revenue recognition in 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, we recognized revenue of $66.0 million and $7.5 million, respectively, related to these upfront payments.\nMilestone payments.\nIn July 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved the New Drug Application for BELVIQ XR. We earned from Eisai a $10.0 million substantive milestone payment from this achievement. In October 2016, Eisai announced the commercial launch of BELVIQ XR in the United States.\nIn July 2016, the Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risk approved the Marketing Authorization Application in Mexico for our twice-daily formulation of lorcaserin for chronic weight management. We earned from Eisai a $1.0 million substantive milestone payment from this achievement.\nIn December 2016, the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency provided regulatory approval in Brazil for BELVIQ. We earned from Eisai a $1.0 million substantive milestone payment from this achievement.\nWe are eligible to receive an additional substantive commercial milestone of $25.0 million upon the achievement of global net sales of lorcaserin for a calendar year first exceeding $250.0 million.\nProduct purchase price and inventory purchase.\nWe manufacture lorcaserin at our facility in Zofingen, Switzerland. Under the Eisai Agreement, we have agreed to manufacture and supply, and Eisai has agreed to purchase from us, all of Eisai's requirements (or specified minimum quantities if such quantities are greater than Eisai's requirements), subject to certain exceptions, for lorcaserin for development and commercial use for an initial two-year period. The initial period may be extended by Eisai for an additional six months upon payment of an extension fee of CHF 2.0 million. Eisai will pay us agreed upon prices to deliver finished drug product during this time. Additionally, Eisai has agreed to pay up to CHF 13.0 million in manufacturing support payments during the initial two-year period supply period, and pay up to CHF 6.0 million in manufacturing support payments during the six-month extension period, if the extension option is exercised by Eisai.\nUnder the Second Amended Agreement, we sold lorcaserin to Eisai for Eisai's commercialization in the United States for a purchase price of 31.5% of Eisai's aggregate annual net product sales (which are the gross invoiced sales less certain deductions described in the Second Amended Agreement), or the Product Purchase Price. The amount that Eisai paid us for lorcaserin product supply was based on Eisai's estimated price at the time the order was shipped, which was Eisai's estimate of the Eisai Product Purchase Price, and was subject to change on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Eisai Product Purchase Price for the product Eisai sold under the Second Amended Agreement was lower than the estimated price that Eisai paid us for such product, primarily due to an increase in deductions from savings cards and returns, partially offset by a decrease in vouchers. At the end of Eisai's fiscal year (March 31), the estimated price paid to us for product that Eisai sold to its distributors was compared to the Eisai Product Purchase Price of such product, and the difference was refunded back to Eisai for the overpayments. The $9.1 million classified as Payable to Eisai within the total liabilities of disposal group held for sale at December 31, 2016, relates to product sold by Eisai to its distributors from April 1, 2015, through March 31, 2016. Under the Eisai Agreement, we were not required to refund to Eisai any net overpayment which would have been otherwise due to Eisai under the Second Amended Agreement for product we sold to Eisai under the Second Amended Agreement which Eisai did not sell to its distributors on or before March 31, 2016. For product which Eisai sold to its distributors from April 1, 2016, through December 28, 2016, we recognized the net overpayment which would have been otherwise due to Eisai under the Second Amended Agreement of $2.0 million as revenues and included this amount in net product sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is a component of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations.\nPrior to December 2016, we deferred recognition of revenue and the related cost at the time we sold lorcaserin to Eisai because we did not have the ability to estimate the amount of product that could have been returned to us and thus recognized revenues and the related costs from net product sales when Eisai shipped BELVIQ to its distributors. Pursuant to a change in the terms of the Eisai Agreement, we determined that we achieved the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of product returns and recognize revenue and the related cost from product sales when we ship BELVIQ to Eisai. On December 28, 2016, we recognized revenues of $6.7 million and costs of $1.9 million on net product sales which had been previously deferred, which is a component of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations.\nAllocation of Eisai Agreement arrangement consideration to the units of accounting.\nThe total arrangement consideration of $115.6 million primarily consists of (i) the December 28, 2016, balances of deferred revenues from the upfront payments received under the prior Eisai agreements and the distribution agreements with Ildong, CYB and Teva; (ii) the $10.0 million payment received from Eisai on December 28, 2016; and (iii) the product purchase payments and manufacturing support payments we expect to receive from Eisai for the initial two-year manufacturing and supply commitment period.\nAll of the deliverables were determined to have standalone value and to meet the criteria to be accounted for as separate units of accounting. Factors considered in the determination included, among other things, for the license, the manufacturing experience and capabilities of Eisai and their sublicense rights, and for the remaining deliverables the fact that they are not proprietary and can be provided by other vendors. The total arrangement consideration was allocated to the units of accounting on the basis of their relative estimated selling prices as follows:\n \u2022 $64.0 million was allocated to the License Deliverable. As the License Deliverable was delivered on December 28, 2016, this amount was recognized as collaboration revenue of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 $30.8 million was allocated to the Inventory Deliverable. Title to this entire inventory passed to Eisai on December 28, 2016. However, none of this inventory was physically transferred from the manufacturing facility on that date. There is no fixed schedule for delivery given a portion has been and will be delivered on a continuous basis as we perform under the manufacturing commitment, another portion has been and will be physically transferred to Eisai upon request by Eisai and the rest is expected to be physically transferred at the end of the manufacturing and supply commitment period. Also, the risks of ownership for this inventory did not pass to Eisai in 2016 as we have financial responsibility for loss, damage or destruction which occurs while in our possession. Therefore, none of the arrangement consideration allocated to this deliverable was recognized as revenue and none of the carrying value of this inventory was recognized as cost of product sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $6.4 million as \n revenue of discontinued operations related to this deliverable and $0.9 million of the carrying value of this inventory as cost of product sales of discontinued operations. \n \u2022 $20.8 million was allocated to the Manufacturing and Supply Commitment Deliverable. This deliverable is being provided over 2017 and 2018 as product is shipped to Eisai. Therefore, none of the arrangement consideration allocated to this deliverable was recognized as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $9.5 million as revenue of discontinued operations related to this deliverable. \nThe estimated selling price represents the price at which we would contract if the deliverable was sold regularly on a standalone basis. The estimated selling price for each unit of accounting was determined as follows:\n \u2022 The estimated selling price for the License Deliverable was determined using an income approach that estimates the net present value of royalties Eisai is expected to earn under the Eisai Agreement as compared to the Second Amended Agreement, net of the development costs we are no longer obligated to spend. This model includes several assumptions, including the potential market for lorcaserin in each relevant jurisdiction, probabilities of obtaining regulatory approval in additional jurisdictions, the impact of competition, the potential impact of Eisai's ongoing development and regulatory activities related to lorcaserin, and the appropriate discount rate. \n \u2022 The estimated selling price for the Inventory Deliverable was determined by considering the historical cost of the precursor materials, adjusted for any changes in market condition and supplier relationships. We believe that the Eisai Agreement pricing represents pricing that would be charged if it were sold on a standalone basis. \n \u2022 The estimated selling price for the Manufacturing and Supply Commitment Deliverable was determined to be the aggregate product purchase payments we expect to receive from Eisai for the initial two-year manufacturing and supply commitment period. As noted above, we believe that the Eisai Agreement pricing represents pricing that would be charged if it were sold on a standalone basis. \nDevelopment payments.\nAs part of the US approval of BELVIQ, the FDA, is requiring the evaluation of the effect of long-term treatment with BELVIQ on the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, or MACE, in overweight and obese patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors (which is the FDA-required portion of the cardiovascular outcomes trial), as well as the conduct of postmarketing studies to assess the safety and efficacy of BELVIQ for weight management in obese pediatric and adolescent patients. Under the Second Amended Agreement, Eisai and we were responsible for 90% and 10%, respectively, of the cost for the FDA-required portion of the cardiovascular outcomes trial, or CVOT, 50% and 50%, respectively, of the non-FDA portion of the studies and we were also obligated to share the cost of FDA-required studies in obese pediatric patients and for additional clinical studies in other territories.\nUnder the Eisai Agreement, Eisai is solely responsible for all costs and expenses in connection with further development of lorcaserin from and after July 1, 2016, and we were relieved of any obligations under the Second Amended Agreement to pay our share of future development costs of lorcaserin. Accordingly, on December 28, 2016, we recorded a reduction of research and development expenses which would have been otherwise due to Eisai under the Second Amended Agreement of $3.7 million for the period from July 1, 2016, through December 28, 2016.\nDecember 31, 2016, and 2015, we recognized expenses of $4.2 million, and $10.8 million, respectively, for external clinical study fees related to lorcaserin, which are included in continuing operations. There were no such expenses in 2017. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 we recognized expenses of $1.4 million, $3.1 million, and $5.4 million, respectively for internal non-commercial manufacturing costs primarily related to lorcaserin, which are included in discontinued operations.\nIldong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\nIn November 2012, we and Ildong entered into the Marketing and Supply Agreement, or Ildong Agreement. Under this agreement, we granted Ildong exclusive rights to commercialize BELVIQ in South Korea for weight loss or weight management in obese and overweight patients. We also provided certain services and manufacture and sold BELVIQ to Ildong. As noted above, the Ildong Agreement was assigned to Eisai pursuant to the Eisai Agreement on December 28, 2016.\nIn connection with entering into the Ildong Agreement, we received from Ildong an upfront payment of $5.0 million, less withholding taxes. Revenues from this upfront payment were deferred, as we determined that the exclusive rights did not have standalone value without our ongoing development and regulatory activities. Accordingly, this payment was recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which we expected the services to be rendered. The assignment of the Ildong Agreement pursuant to the\nEisai Agreement effectively eliminated our obligation to continue performing the development and regulatory activities required in the Ildong Agreement. Therefore, on December 28, 2016, the $3.5 million of deferred revenues from this upfront payment was allocated to the value of the License provided to Eisai and recognized as revenue in 2016.\nIn February 2015, we earned a substantive milestone payment of $3.0 million upon the approval of BELVIQ for marketing in South Korea for weight management. We received the payment, less withholding taxes, in March 2015.\nUnder the Ildong Agreement, we manufactured BELVIQ at our facility in Zofingen, Switzerland, and sold BELVIQ to Ildong for a purchase price starting at the higher of the defined minimum amount or 35% of Ildong's annual net product sales (which are the gross invoiced sales less certain deductions described in the Ildong Agreement), or the Ildong Product Purchase Price. The Ildong Product Purchase Price increased on a tiered basis up to the higher of the defined minimum amount or 45% on the portion of annual net product sales exceeding $15.0 million. Since the inception of commercial sales of BELVIQ in South Korea in 2015, the Ildong Product Purchase Price equaled the defined minimum amount (which exceeded the amounts calculated using the applicable percentages for the applicable tiers of Ildong's annual net product sales).\nPrior to December 2016, we deferred recognition of revenue and the related cost at the time we sold BELVIQ to Ildong because we did not have the ability to estimate the amount of product that could have been returned to us and thus recognized revenues and the related costs from net product sales when Ildong shipped BELVIQ to its distributors. In December 2016, we determined that we achieved the ability to reasonably estimate product returns under the Ildong Agreement. Accordingly, we recognized revenues of $2.0 million and costs of $0.7 million in December 2016 on net product sales which had been previously deferred, which is a component of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenues of $11.4 million and $8.9 million, respectively, under the Ildong agreement, of which $7.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively are included in discontinued operations. No revenues were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 under this agreement.\nCY Biotech Company Limited.\nIn July 2013, we entered into the CYB Agreement. Under this agreement, we granted CYB exclusive rights to commercialize BELVIQ in Taiwan for weight loss or weight management"}
