Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" included below the Table of Contents, Risk Factors\u201d, and the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company sells variable annuities, universal life insurance, variable life insurance and term life insurance primarily through affiliated and unaffiliated distributors in the United States.\nCOVID-19\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) created extreme stress and disruption in the global economy and financial markets and elevated mortality and morbidity experience for the global population. These events impacted our results of operations throughout 2020 and are expected to impact our results of operations in 2021. The Company has taken several measures to manage the impacts of this crisis. The actual and expected impacts of these events and other items are included in the following update:\n\u2022Outlook. We expect COVID-19 to continue to contribute to elevated levels of mortality, resulting in increased life insurance claims in the near-term. We have taken pricing and product actions to ensure we realize appropriate returns for the current economic environment, and to diversify our product mix to further limit our sensitivity to interest rates, while maintaining a solid value proposition for our customers. These actions included the suspension in July 2020 of our single life guaranteed universal life product, and a pivot to less rate-sensitive annuities products with the decision to discontinue sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits effective December 31, 2020. In addition, while our distribution platforms include a suite of digital, hybrid, and in-person options, mandated social distancing has limited in-person engagement between customers and financial professionals. Collectively, we expect the product actions we have taken and the constrained distribution environment to adversely impact our sales prospects in the near-term.\n\u2022Results of Operations. For the year ended 2020, we reported a net gain of $197 million, inclusive of the unfavorable financial market conditions and COVID-19 related claims that impacted our reported results. See Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of results for the full year of 2020.\n\u2022Liquidity. The impact of COVID-19 and related market dislocations could strain our existing liquidity and cause us to increase the use of our alternative sources of liquidity, which could result in increased financial leverage on our balance sheet and negatively impact our credit and financial strength ratings or ratings outlooks. See Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity\u201d for a discussion of our liquidity.\n\u2022Capital Resources. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained capital levels consistent with our ratings targets; however, market conditions could negatively impact our statutory capital and constrain our overall capital flexibility. Adverse market conditions could require us to take additional management actions to maintain capital consistent with our ratings objectives, which may include redeploying financial resources from internal sources, or using available affiliate sources of capital or seeking additional sources. See Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital\u201d for a discussion of our capital resources.\n\u2022Risk Factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our results of operations, financial position, investment portfolio, new business opportunities and operations, and these impacts are expected to continue. For additional information on the risks to our business posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, see Risk Factors.\u201d\n\u2022Business Continuity. One of the main impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has been executing Prudential Financial Inc.'s (\"Prudential Financial\") and our business continuity protocols to ensure our employees are safe and able to serve our customers. This included effectively transitioning the vast majority of our employees to remote work arrangements.\nWe believe we can sustain remote work and social distancing for an indefinite period while ensuring that critical business operations are sustained. In addition, we are managing COVID-19-related impacts on third-party provided services, and do not anticipate significant interruption in critical operations.\n\u2022CARES Act and Other Regulatory Developments. In March 2020 Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"the CARES Act\"), which provides $2 trillion in economic stimulus to taxpayers, small businesses, and corporations through various grant and loan programs, tax provisions and regulatory relief. One provision of the CARES Act amends the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") and allows companies with net operating losses ( NOLs\u201d) originating in 2018, 2019 or 2020 to carry back those losses for five years. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOther governments and regulators, including the NAIC and state insurance regulators, have implemented, or are considering, a number of actions in response to the crisis, including delaying implementation of certain regulatory changes, temporarily waiving certain regulatory requirements and requiring or requesting insurers to waive premium payments and policy provisions and exclusions for certain periods of time.\nThe Company is not aware of any new or proposed government mandates that could materially impact the Company's solvency or liquidity position.\nRevenues and Expenses\nThe Company earns revenues principally from insurance premiums, mortality and expense fees, asset administration fees from insurance and investment products, and from net investment income on the investment of general account and other funds. The Company receives premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and annuity products. The Company earns mortality and expense fees, and asset administration fees, primarily from the sale and servicing of universal life insurance and separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities. The Company's operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided and reserves established for anticipated future insurance benefits, general business expenses, reinsurance premiums, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products sold and interest credited on general account liabilities.\nIndustry Trends\nOur business is impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight, and a variety of trends that affect the industries where we compete.\nFinancial and Economic Environment. Interest rates in the U.S. have experienced a sustained period of historically low levels, which continue to negatively impact our investment-related activity, including our investment income returns, net investment spread results, and portfolio income and reinvestment yields. See Impact of a Low Interest Rate Environment\u201d below. In addition, we are subject to financial impacts associated with movements in equity markets and the evolution of the credit cycle as discussed in Risk Factors\u201d.\nDemographics. Customer demographics continue to evolve and new opportunities present themselves in different consumer segments such as the millennial and multicultural markets. Consumer expectations and preferences are changing. We believe existing customers and potential customers are increasingly looking for cost-effective solutions that they can easily understand and access through technology-enabled devices. At the same time, income protection, wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers are continuing to shape the insurance industry. A persistent retirement security gap exists in terms of both savings and protection. Despite the ongoing phenomenon of the risk and responsibility of retirement savings shifting from employers to employees, employers are becoming increasingly focused on the financial wellness of the individuals they employ.\nRegulatory Environment. See Business-Regulation\u201d for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the Company and the associated risks.\nCompetitive Environment. See Business\u201d for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which we compete.\nImpact of a Low Interest Rate Environment\nAs a global financial services company, market interest rates are a key driver of the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Changes in interest rates can affect our results of operations and/or our financial condition in several ways, including favorable or adverse impacts to:\n\u2022investment-related activity, including: investment income returns, net interest margins, net investment spread results,\nnew money rates, mortgage loan prepayments and bond redemptions;\n\u2022hedging costs and other risk mitigation activities;\n\u2022insurance reserve levels, market experience true-ups and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ( DAC\u201d);\n\u2022customer account values, including their impact on fee income;\n\u2022product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and\n\u2022policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.\nFor more information on interest rate risks, see \"Risk Factors-Market Risk\".\nAccounting Policies & Pronouncements\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. If management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, the Company's results of operations and financial position as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements could change significantly.\nThe following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.\nInsurance Assets\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Deferred Sales Inducements\nWe capitalize costs that are directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance and annuity contracts. These costs primarily include commissions, as well as costs of policy issuance and underwriting and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully negotiated contracts. We have also deferred costs associated with sales inducements offered in the past related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts. Sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholders' account balances mainly as an inducement to purchase the contract. For additional information about sales inducements, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We generally amortize DAC and deferred sales inducements (\"DSI\") over the expected lives of the contracts, based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross premiums or gross profits, depending on the type of contract. As described in more detail below, in calculating DAC and DSI amortization we are required to make assumptions about investment returns, mortality, persistency and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross profits or gross premiums. We also periodically evaluate the recoverability of our DAC and DSI. For certain contracts, this evaluation is performed as part of our premium deficiency testing, as discussed further below in Insurance Liabilities-Future Policy Benefits\u201d. As of December 31, 2020, DAC for our life products was $2.4 billion. There were no DAC and DSI balances as of December 31, 2020 for our annuity products due to a series of reinsurance transactions that the Company entered into on April 1, 2016 with Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation (\"PALAC\") and The Prudential Insurance Company of America (\"Prudential Insurance\"). See Note 6, Note 8 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAmortization methodologies\nGross Premiums. DAC associated with term life policies is primarily amortized in proportion to gross premiums. Gross premiums are defined as the premiums charged to a policyholder for an insurance contract.\nGross Profits. DAC and DSI associated with the variable and universal life policies and the variable and fixed annuity contracts are generally amortized over the expected lives of these policies in proportion to total gross profits. Total gross profits include both actual gross profits and estimates of gross profits for future periods. Gross profits are defined as (i) amounts assessed for mortality, contract administration, surrender charges, and other assessments plus amounts earned from investment of policyholder balances less (ii) benefits in excess of policyholder balances, costs incurred for contract administration, the net cost of reinsurance for certain products, interest credited to policyholder balances and other credits. If significant negative gross profits are expected in any periods, the amount of insurance in force is generally substituted as the base for computing amortization. U.S. GAAP gross profits and amortization rates also include the impacts of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts, and index-linked crediting features of certain universal life contracts and related hedging activities. In calculating amortization expense, we estimate the amounts of gross profits that will be included in our U.S. GAAP results and utilize these estimates to calculate distinct amortization rates and expense amounts. In addition, in calculating gross profits, we include the profits and losses related to contracts issued by the Company that are reported in affiliated legal entities other than the Company as a result of, for example, reinsurance agreements with those affiliated entities. The Company is an indirect subsidiary of Prudential Financial (an SEC registrant) and has extensive transactions and relationships with other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial, including reinsurance agreements, as discussed in Note 9 and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Incorporating all product-related profits and losses in gross profits, including those that are reported in affiliated legal entities, produces an amortization pattern representative of the total economics of the products. For a further discussion of the amortization of DAC and DSI, see -Results of Operations\u201d.\nWe also regularly evaluate and adjust the related DAC and DSI balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the impact of actual gross profits and changes in our projections of estimated future gross profits on our DAC and DSI amortization rates. Adjustments to the DAC and DSI balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions, our quarterly adjustments for current period experience and our quarterly adjustments for market performance. Each of these adjustments is further discussed below in -Annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments.\u201d\nAnnual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments\nAnnually, we perform a comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods. Over the last several years, the Company's most significant assumption updates that have resulted in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of DAC and DSI have been related to lapse and other contractholder behavior assumptions, mortality, and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments. These assumptions may also cause potential significant variability in amortization expense in the future. The impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nThe quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period. To the extent each period's actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross profits may change. In these cases, we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods' amortization, also referred to as an experience true-up adjustment.\nThe quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and market conditions. A significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts and, to a lesser degree, our variable life contracts are dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. This rate of return influences the fees we earn on variable annuity and variable life contracts, costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts and expected claims to be paid on variable life contracts, as well as other sources of profit. Returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances, which increase the future fees we expect to earn on variable annuity and variable life contracts and decrease the future costs we expect to incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts and expected claims to be paid on variable life contracts. The opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations. The changes in future expected gross profits are used to recognize a cumulative adjustment to all prior periods' amortization.\nThe weighted average rate of return assumptions used in developing estimated market returns consider many factors specific to each product type, including asset durations, asset allocations and other factors. With regard to equity market assumptions, the near-term future rate of return assumption used in evaluating DAC and DSI for our variable annuity and variable life insurance products is derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider historical equity returns and adjust projected equity returns over an initial future period of five years (the near-term\u201d) so that equity returns converge to the long-term expected rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is greater than our near-term maximum future rate of return of 15.0%, we use our maximum future rate of return. As of December 31, 2020, our variable annuities and variable life insurance businesses assume an 8.0% long-term equity expected rate of return and a 1.3% near-term mean reversion equity expected rate of return.\nWith regard to interest rate assumptions used in evaluating DAC and DSI, we update the long-term and near-term future rates used to project fixed income returns annually and quarterly, respectively. As a result of our 2020 annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, we reduced our long-term expectation of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate by 50 basis points and now grade to a rate of 3.25% over ten years. As part of our quarterly market experience updates, we update our near-term projections of interest rates to reflect changes in current rates.\nInsurance Liabilities\nFuture Policy Benefits\nFuture Policy Benefit Reserves, including Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nWe establish reserves for future policy benefits to, or on behalf of, policyholders, using methodologies prescribed by U.S. GAAP. The reserving methodologies used include the following:\n\u2022For most long-duration contracts, we utilize a net premium valuation methodology in measuring the liability for future policy benefits. Under this methodology, a liability for future policy benefits is accrued when premium revenue is recognized. The liability, which represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums (portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses), is estimated using methods that include assumptions applicable at the time the insurance contracts are made with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. Original assumptions continue to be used in subsequent accounting periods to determine changes in the liability for future policy benefits (often referred to as the lock-in concept\u201d), unless a premium deficiency exists. The result of the net premium valuation methodology is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of premiums received to date expected to be needed to fund future benefits (i.e., net premiums received to date), less any benefits and expenses already paid. The liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the Company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that obligation would be funded by net premiums received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. We perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. If the liabilities determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net reserves (i.e., GAAP reserves net of any DAC or DSI asset), the existing net reserves are adjusted by first reducing these assets by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the deficiency is more than these asset balances for insurance contracts, we then increase the net reserves by the excess, again through a charge to current period earnings. If a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions as of the premium deficiency test date are locked-in and used in subsequent valuations and the net reserves continue to be subject to premium deficiency testing. In addition, for limited-payment contracts, future policy benefit reserves also include a deferred profit liability representing gross premiums received in excess of net premiums. The deferred profits are generally recognized in revenue in a constant relationship with insurance in force or with the amount of expected future benefit payments.\n\u2022For certain contract features, such as those related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ( GMDB\u201d), guaranteed minimum income benefits ( GMIB\u201d) and no-lapse guarantees, a liability is established when associated assessments (which include policy charges for administration, mortality, expense, surrender, and other, regardless of how characterized) are recognized. This liability is established using current best estimate assumptions and is based on the ratio of the present value of total expected excess payments (e.g., payments in excess of account value) over the life of the contract divided by the present value of total expected assessments (i.e., benefit ratio). The liability equals the current benefit ratio multiplied by cumulative assessments recognized to date, plus interest, less cumulative excess payments to date. The result of the benefit ratio method is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of assessments received to date expected to be needed to fund future excess payments, less any excess payments already paid. The liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the Company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that excess payment would be funded by assessments received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. Similar to as described above for DAC, the reserves are subject to adjustments based on annual reviews of assumptions and quarterly adjustments for experience, including market performance. These adjustments reflect the impact on the benefit ratio of using actual historical experience from the issuance date to the balance sheet date plus updated estimates of future experience. The updated benefit ratio is then applied to all prior periods' assessments to derive an adjustment to the reserve recognized through a benefit or charge to current period earnings.\n\u2022For certain product guarantees, primarily certain optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ( GMAB\u201d), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ( GMWB\u201d) and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits ( GMIWB\u201d), the benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives using a fair value accounting framework. The fair value of these contracts is calculated as the present value of expected future benefit payments to contractholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. Under U.S. GAAP, the fair values of these benefit features are based on assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these embedded derivatives. Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded quarterly through a benefit or charge to current period earnings. For additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe assumptions used in establishing reserves are generally based on the Company's experience, industry experience and/or other factors, as applicable. We update our actuarial assumptions, such as mortality and policyholder behavior assumptions annually, unless a material change is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long-term trend. Generally, we do not expect trends to change significantly in the short-term and, to the extent these trends may change, we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term. In a sustained low interest rate environment, there is an increased likelihood that the reserves determined based on best estimate assumptions may be greater than the net liabilities.\nThe following paragraphs provide additional details about the reserves we have established:\nThe reserves for future policy benefits of our individual annuity business relate to reserves for the GMDB and GMIB features of our variable annuities, and for the optional living benefit features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. As discussed above, in establishing reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. The primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include annuitization, lapse, withdrawal and mortality assumptions, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. Lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on the in-the-moneyness of the living benefit and reflect other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. Lapse rates are reduced when contracts are more in-the-money. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply. For life contingent payout annuity contracts, we establish reserves using best estimate assumptions with provisions for adverse deviations as of inception or best estimate assumptions as of the most recent loss recognition event.\nThe reserves for certain optional living benefit features, including GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value, as described above. This methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, given changing capital market conditions and various actuarial assumptions. Since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. The models are based on a risk neutral valuation framework and incorporate premiums for risks inherent in valuation techniques, inputs, and the general uncertainty around the timing and amount of future cash flows. The significant inputs to the valuation models for these embedded derivatives include capital market assumptions, such as interest rate levels and volatility assumptions, the Company's market-perceived risk of its own non-performance risk ( NPR\u201d), as well as actuarially determined assumptions, including mortality rates and contractholder behavior, such as lapse rates, benefit utilization rates and withdrawal rates. Capital market inputs and actual contractholders' account values are updated each quarter based on capital market conditions as of the end of the quarter, including interest rates, equity markets and volatility. In the risk neutral valuation, the initial swap curve drives the total returns used to grow the contractholders' account values. The Company's discount rate assumption is based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) swap curve adjusted for an additional spread, which includes an estimate of NPR. Actuarial assumptions, including contractholder behavior and mortality, are reviewed at least annually and updated based upon emerging experience, future expectations and other data, including any observable market data, such as available industry studies or market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. For additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe reserves for future policy benefits of our individual life business relate to term life, universal life and variable life products. For term life contracts, the future policy benefit reserves are generally calculated using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. The primary assumptions used in determining expected future benefits and expenses include mortality, lapse, investment yield and maintenance expense assumptions. For variable and universal life products, which include universal life contracts that contain no-lapse guarantees, reserves for future policy benefits are primarily established using the reserving methodology for GMDB and GMIB contracts. As discussed above, in establishing reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. The primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include mortality, lapse, and premium pattern, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported.\nPolicyholders' Account Balances\nPolicyholders' account balances liability represents the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date. This liability is primarily associated with the accumulated account deposits, plus interest credited, less policyholder withdrawals and other charges assessed against the account balance, as applicable. The liability also includes provisions for benefits under non-life contingent payout annuities. Our unearned revenue reserve ( URR\u201d), also reported as a component of Policyholders' account balances\u201d, gross of reinsurance with a partial offset in Reinsurance recoverables\u201d. The URR balance was $1,378 million as of December 31, 2020. This reserve primarily relates to the variable and universal life products and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods. The charges are deferred as unearned revenue and are generally amortized over the expected life of the contract in proportion to the product's estimated gross profits, similar to DAC and DSI as discussed above. Policyholders' account balances also include amounts representing the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the index-linked features of certain universal life products. For additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSensitivities for Insurance Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table summarizes the impact that could result on each of the listed financial statement balances from changes in certain key assumptions. The information below is for illustrative purposes and includes only the hypothetical direct impact on December 31, 2020 balances of changes in a single assumption and not changes in any combination of assumptions. Additionally, the illustration of the insurance assumption impacts below reflects a parallel shift in the insurance assumptions; however, these may be non-parallel in practice. Changes in current assumptions could result in impacts to financial statement balances that are in excess of the amounts illustrated. A description of the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of each of these financial statement balances is provided above. For traditional long-duration and limited-payment contracts, U.S. GAAP requires the original assumptions used when the contracts are issued to be locked-in and that those assumptions be used in all future liability calculations as long as the resulting liabilities are adequate to provide for the future benefits and expenses (i.e., there is no premium deficiency). Therefore, these products are not reflected in the sensitivity table below unless the hypothetical change in assumption would result in an adverse impact that would cause a premium deficiency. Similarly, the impact of any favorable change in assumptions for traditional long duration and limited-payment contracts is not reflected in the table below given that the current assumption is required to remain locked-in and instead the positive impacts would be recognized into net income over the life of the policies in force.\nThe impacts presented within this table exclude the related impacts of our asset liability management strategy which seeks to offset the changes in the balances presented within this table and is primarily composed of investments and derivatives. See further below for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions involved with the application of U.S. GAAP accounting policies for these instruments and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for hypothetical impacts on related balances as a result of changes in certain significant assumptions.\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) in </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs </td> <td> </td> <td>Reinsurance Recoverables </td> <td> </td> <td>Future Policy Benefits and Policyholders' Account Balances </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Impact </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hypothetical change in current assumptions: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 25 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 25 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term equity expected rate of return </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(95) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(85) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NPR credit spread </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,700) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,785) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(120) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortality </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 1% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(175) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(180) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 1% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lapse </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 10% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(700) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(750) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 10% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nValuation of Investments, Including Derivatives, Measurement of Allowance for Credit Loss, and the Recognition of Other-than-Temporary Impairments\nOur investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities, other invested assets and derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities. Derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) market. We are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are embedded\u201d in the financial instruments. Management believes the following accounting policies related to investments, including derivatives, are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. Each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to investments and derivatives, as referenced below:\n\u2022Valuation of investments, including derivatives;\n\u2022Measurement of the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, commercial mortgage loans, and other loans; and\n\u2022Recognition of other-than-temporary impairments (\"OTTI\") for equity method investments.\nWe present at fair value in the statements of financial position our debt security investments classified as available-for-sale, investments classified as trading, and certain fixed maturities, equity securities and certain investments within Other invested assets,\u201d such as derivatives. For additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as derivative instruments, embedded derivatives and other investments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor our investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d ( AOCI\u201d), a separate component of equity. For our investments classified as trading and equity securities, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within Other income\u201d. Our commercial mortgage and other loans are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses and unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses.\nIn addition, an allowance for credit losses is measured each quarter for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans. For additional information regarding our policies regarding the measurement of credit losses, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor equity method investments, the carrying value of these investments is written down or impaired to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. For additional information regarding our OTTI policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTaxes on Income\nOur effective tax rate is based on income, non-taxable and non-deductible items, tax credits, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. The Dividend Received Deduction ( DRD\u201d) is a major reason for the difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate. The DRD is an estimate that incorporates the prior and current year information, as well as the current year's equity market performance. Both the current estimate of the DRD and the DRD in future periods can vary based on factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the amount of dividends received that are eligible for the DRD, changes in the amount of distributions received from underlying fund investments, changes in the account balances of variable life and annuity contracts, and the Company's taxable income before the DRD.\nIn December 2017, Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d ( SAB 118\u201d), which allowed the registrants to record provisional amounts during a \u2018measurement period' not to extend beyond one year. Under the relief provided by SAB 118, a company could recognize provisional amounts when it did not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of refinements to provisional amounts related to The United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( Tax Act of 2017\u201d) included in Income tax expense (benefit) before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures\u201d in 2018.\nAn increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percentage point would have resulted in a decrease or increase in our 2020 \"Income tax expense (benefit)\" of $1 million.\nThe CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) was enacted into law. One provision of the CARES Act amends the Tax Act of 2017 and allows companies with net operating losses ( NOLs\u201d) originating in 2018, 2019, or 2020 to carry back those losses up to five years. For 2020, the Company has recorded an income tax benefit of $70 million from carrying the estimated 2020 NOL back to tax years that have a 35% tax rate.\nContingencies\nA contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. Under U.S. GAAP, accruals for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated, such as in connection with an unresolved legal matter. The initial reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and, ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2018-12, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) on August 15, 2018 and is expected to have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-09, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date to affirm its decision to defer the effective date of ASU 2018-12 to January 1, 2022 (with early adoption permitted), representing a one year extension from the original effective date of January 1, 2021. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in November 2020 the FASB issued ASU 2020-11, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date and Early Application to defer for an additional one year the effective date of ASU 2018-12 from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023, and to provide transition relief to facilitate the early adoption of the ASU. The transition relief would allow large calendar-year public companies that early adopt ASU 2018-12 to apply the guidance either as of January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021, respectively) in the 2022 financial statements. Companies that do not early adopt ASU 2018-12 would apply the guidance as of January 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of January 1, 2021) in the 2023 financial statements. The Company currently intends to adopt ASU 2018-12 effective January 1, 2023. ASU 2018-12 will impact, at least to some extent, the accounting and disclosure requirements for all long-duration insurance and investment contracts issued by the Company. In addition to the impacts to the balance sheet upon adoption, the Company also expects an impact to how earnings emerge thereafter. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of ASU 2018-12, as well as other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted and newly adopted accounting pronouncements.\nChanges in Financial Position\n2020 to 2019 Annual Comparison\nTotal assets increased $17 billion from $191 billion at December 31, 2019 to $208 billion at December 31, 2020. Significant components were:\n\u2022Reinsurance recoverables increased $8 billion primarily related to the variable annuity reinsured living benefit liabilities resulting from an increase in future expected benefit payments driven by declining interest rates, partially offset by favorable equity market performance, in addition to unfavorable universal life guaranteed minimum death benefit reserves from ongoing adverse insurance and investment assumption updates;\n\u2022Separate account assets increased $7 billion primarily driven by favorable market performance, partially offset by net outflows and policy charges; and\n\u2022Total investments and Cash and cash equivalents increased $2 billion primarily driven by capital contributions of $575 million to fund additional reserve requirements and unrealized gains on investments due to tightening credit spreads.\nTotal liabilities increased $16 billion from $188 billion at December 31, 2019 to $204 billion at December 31, 2020. Significant components were:\n\u2022Future policy benefits increased $8 billion primarily driven by an increase in the variable annuity living benefit liabilities and ongoing impacts from assumption updates, as discussed above, and business growth on the universal life business;\n\u2022Separate account liabilities increased $7 billion corresponding to the increase in Separate account assets, as discussed above; and\n\u2022Policyholders' account balances increased $1 billion primarily driven by universal life business growth.\nTotal equity increased $1 billion primarily driven by capital contributions from Prudential Insurance to fund additional reserve requirements, as discussed above.\nResults of Operations\nIncome (loss) from Operations before Income Taxes\n2020 to 2019 Annual Comparison\nIncome from operations before income taxes decreased $91 million from income of $159 million in 2019 to income of $68 million in 2020. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, income decreased $131 million primarily driven by:\n\u2022Higher Policyholders' benefits from an increase in reserves due to continued growth in retained principle-based reserving ( PBR\u201d) products and higher mortality;\nPartially offset by:\n\u2022Higher Policy charges and fee income due to increased variable life sales and higher charges from PBR universal life policies; and\n\u2022Higher Premiums from continued growth in PBR term policies.\nRevenues, Benefits and Expenses\n2020 to 2019 Annual Comparison\nRevenues increased $174 million from a gain of $949 million in 2019 to a gain of $1,123 million in 2020. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update to our assumptions and other refinements, the increase was $136 million primarily driven by:\n\u2022Higher Policy charges and fee income due to increased variable life sales and higher charges from PBR universal life policies;\n\u2022Higher Premiums from continued growth in PBR term policies retained; and\n\u2022Higher Realized investment gains (losses), net driven by an increase in living benefit fees ceded as reserves on the living benefit guarantees increased relatively more than prior year partially offset by losses on fixed maturity investments from tightening credit spreads.\nBenefits and expenses increased $265 million from an expense of $791 million in 2019 to an expense of $1,055 million in 2020. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update to our assumptions and other refinements, the increase was $267 million primarily driven by:\n\u2022Higher Policyholders' benefits from an increase in reserves due to continued growth in retained PBR products and higher mortality; and\n\u2022Higher Interest credited to policyholders' accounts driven by retained business growth and unfavorable impacts from the Indexed Universal Life product's future segment valuation.\nRisks and Risk Mitigants\nVariable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, along with actuarial assumptions such as contractholder mortality, the timing and amount of annuitization and withdrawals, and contract lapses. For these risk exposures, achievement of our expected returns is subject to the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. Prudential Financial manages our exposure to certain risks driven by fluctuations in capital markets primarily through a combination of Product Design Features and an Asset Liability Management Strategy (\"ALM\"), as discussed below. The Company also manages these risk exposures through reinsurance for certain of our variable annuity products. For information on our reinsurance agreements, see Business-Reinsurance\u201d and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefit riders have been discontinued as of December 31, 2020. See Business-Products\u201d section for more information about these products.\nProduct Design Features:\nA portion of the variable annuity contracts that we offer include an asset transfer feature. This feature is implemented at the contract level, and transfers assets between certain variable investment sub-accounts selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond fund sub-account within the separate account. The objective of the asset transfer feature is to reduce our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. The asset transfer feature associated with currently-sold highest daily living benefit products uses a designated bond fund sub-account within the separate account. The transfers are based on a static mathematical formula used with the particular benefit which considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of investment performance on the contractholder's total account value. Other product design features we utilize include, among others, asset allocation restrictions, minimum issuance age requirements and certain limitations on the amount of contractholder purchase payments, as well as a required minimum allocation to our general account for certain of our products. We continue to introduce products that diversify our risk profile and have incorporated provisions in product design allowing frequent revisions of key pricing elements for certain of our products. In addition, there is diversity in our fee arrangements, as certain fees are primarily based on the benefit guarantee amount, the contractholder account value and/or premiums, which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account values to decline.\nAsset Liability Management Strategy (including fixed income instruments and derivatives):\nPALAC and Prudential Insurance employ an ALM strategy that utilizes a combination of both traditional fixed income instruments and derivatives to help defray potential claims associated with our variable annuity living benefit guarantees. The economic liability we manage with this ALM strategy consists of expected living benefit claims under less severe market conditions, which are managed using an ALM strategy through the accumulation of fixed income and derivative instruments, and potential living benefit claims resulting from more severe market conditions, which are hedged using derivative instruments. For our Prudential Defined Income variable annuity, we utilize fixed income instruments to help defray potential claims. For the portion of our ALM strategy executed with derivatives, PALAC and Prudential Insurance enter into a range of exchange-traded and over-the-counter equity and interest rate derivatives, including, but not limited to: equity and treasury futures; total return and interest rate swaps; and options, including equity options, swaptions, and floors and caps. The intent of this strategy is to more efficiently manage the capital and liquidity associated with these products while continuing to mitigate fluctuations in net income due to movements in capital markets. Since the ALM strategy is conducted in PALAC and Prudential Insurance, the results of the strategy do not directly impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nCapital Hedge Program:\nA capital hedge program is employed within PALAC to protect a portion of the overall capital position of the variable annuities business against its exposure to the equity markets. The capital hedge program is conducted using equity derivatives which include equity call and put options, total return swaps and futures contracts. Since the capital hedge program is conducted in PALAC, the results of the strategy do not directly impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nIncome Taxes\nThe differences between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% applicable for 2020, 2019 and 2018, and the reported income tax expense (benefit) are provided in the following table:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected federal income tax expense (benefit) at federal statutory rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-taxable investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>(47) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax credits </td> <td> </td> <td>(28) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in tax law </td> <td> </td> <td>(70) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Settlements with taxing authorities </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(130) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(59) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(53) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td>(191.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(37.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(91.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate is the ratio of Income tax expense (benefit)\u201d divided by Income (loss) from operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures.\" Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was (191.2)%, (37.2)% and (91.1)%, respectively. For a detailed description of the nature of each significant reconciling item, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in the effective tax rate from (37.2)% in 2019 to (191.2)% in 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in pre-tax income in 2020 and the impact of the CARES Act. The increase in the effective tax rate from (91.1)% in 2018 to (37.2)% in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income in 2019.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe Company's liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest that relate to tax years still subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. The completion of review or the expiration of the Federal statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes. The Company had no unrecognized benefit as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. We do not anticipate any significant changes within the next 12 months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.\nIncome Tax Expense vs. Income Tax Paid in Cash\nIncome tax expense recorded under U.S. GAAP routinely differs from the income taxes paid in cash in any given year. Income tax expense recorded under U.S. GAAP is based on income reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the current period and it includes both current and deferred taxes. Income taxes paid during the year include tax installments made for the current year as well as tax payments and refunds related to prior periods.\nFor additional information on income tax related items, see Business-Regulation\u201d and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the Company. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of our business, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our business, general economic conditions, our ability to borrow from affiliates and our access to the capital markets through affiliates as described herein.\nOur businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by domestic and international regulators. These regulations currently include requirements (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making) relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, stress-testing, overall risk management, credit exposure reporting and credit concentration. For information on these regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on us, see Business-Regulation\" and Risk Factors\".\nCOVID-19 and Related Market Disruptions\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, broad market concerns over the impact of COVID-19 have led to significant volatility and disruptions in the global economy and financial markets. In 2020, we took the following significant management actions that impacted our liquidity and capital position, including in response to this macro environment and the global pandemic:\n\u2022We accelerated our product diversification strategy and repriced certain products, which are expected to support the capital position over time.\nLiquidity. The Company continues to operate with significant liquid resources; nevertheless, adverse developments related to COVID-19 and associated market dislocations could strain our existing liquidity. Any need to increase the use of our alternative sources of liquidity, may result in increased financial leverage on our balance sheet and negatively impact our credit and financial strength ratings or ratings outlooks.\nCapital. As of December 31, 2020, the Company maintained capital levels consistent with its ratings targets. However, market conditions could negatively impact the statutory capital and constrain our overall capital flexibility. For example, adverse market conditions may lead to increased defaults and/or further deterioration in the credit quality or fair values of our investment portfolio, which would negatively impact the statutory capital of the Company and its insurance subsidiary. Adverse market conditions could require us to take additional management actions to maintain capital consistent with ratings objectives, which may include redeploying financial resources from internal sources or, using available external sources of capital or seeking additional sources.\nLiquidity and Capital Risk Management. Effective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the organization. Management monitors the liquidity of the Company on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon. We use a Risk Appetite Framework ( RAF\u201d) to ensure that all risks taken by the Company aligns with our capacity and willingness to take those risks. The RAF provides a dynamic assessment of capital and liquidity stress impacts, including scenarios similar to, and more severe than, those occurring due to COVID-19, and is intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available to absorb those impacts. We believe that our capital and liquidity resources are sufficient to satisfy the capital and liquidity requirements of the Company.\nCapital\nWe manage the Company to regulatory capital levels consistent with our \"AA\" ratings targets. We utilize the risk-based capital ( RBC\u201d) ratio as a primary measure of capital adequacy. RBC is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with the practices of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\"). RBC considers, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer's products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring an insurer's solvency and ability to pay future claims. The reporting of RBC measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities, but is available to the public. The Company's capital levels substantially exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations. Our regulatory capital levels may be affected in the future by changes to the applicable regulations, proposals for which are currently under consideration by both domestic and international insurance regulators.\nThe regulatory capital level of the Company can be materially impacted by interest rate and equity market fluctuations, changes in the values of derivatives, the level of impairments recorded, and credit quality migration of the investment portfolio, among other items. In addition, the reinsurance of business or the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by, or credit quality migration affecting, the reinsurers or for other reasons could negatively impact regulatory capital levels. The Company's regulatory capital level is also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator.\nAffiliated Captive Reinsurance Companies\nPrudential Financial and the Company use captive reinsurance companies for our individual life business to more effectively manage our reserves and capital on an economic basis and to enable the aggregation and transfer of risks. The captive reinsurance companies assume business from affiliates only. To support the risks they assume, the captives are capitalized to a level we believe is consistent with the AA\u201d financial strength rating targets of Prudential Financial's insurance subsidiaries. All of the captive reinsurance companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial and are located domestically, typically in the state of domicile of the direct writing insurance subsidiary that cedes the majority of business to the captive. In addition to state insurance regulation, the captives are subject to internal policies governing their activities. In the normal course of business, Prudential Financial contributes capital to the captives to support business growth and other needs. Prudential Financial has also entered into support agreements with several of the captives in connection with financing arrangements.\nOur life insurance subsidiaries are subject to a regulation entitled Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation,\u201d commonly known as Regulation XXX,\u201d and a supporting guideline entitled The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation,\u201d commonly known as Guideline AXXX.\u201d The regulation and supporting guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees at a level that exceeds what our actuarial assumptions for this business would otherwise require. Prudential Financial uses captive reinsurance companies to finance the portion of the reserves for this business that we consider to be non-economic as described below under -Financing Activities-Term and Universal Life Reserve Financing.\u201d\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, as described more fully below, including portfolios of liquid assets. Our investment portfolios are integral to the overall liquidity of the Company. We use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet projected cash outflows, including claims. The impact of Prudential Funding, LLC's (\"Prudential Funding\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, financing capacity on liquidity is considered in the internal liquidity measures of the Company.\nLiquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (e.g., type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our liquidity under various stress scenarios, including company-specific and market-wide events. We continue to believe that cash generated by ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios.\nThe principal sources of the Company's liquidity are premiums and certain annuity considerations, investment and fee income, investment maturities, sales of investments and internal borrowings. The principal uses of that liquidity include benefits, claims, and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Other uses of liquidity include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, the payment of dividends and returns of capital to the parent company, hedging and reinsurance activity and payments in connection with financing activities.\nIn managing liquidity, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. We use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers.\nLiquid Assets\nLiquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, U.S. Treasury fixed maturities, fixed maturities that are not designated as held-to-maturity, and public equity securities. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had liquid assets of $7.6 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively. The portion of liquid assets comprised cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was $0.5 billion and $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, $6.6 billion, or 94%, of the fixed maturity investments in the Company's general account portfolios were rated high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating.\nFinancing Activities\nTerm and Universal Life Reserve Financing\nFor business written prior to the implementation of principle-based reserving, Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX require domestic life insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life policies with similar guarantees. Many market participants believe that these levels of reserves are excessive relative to the levels reasonably required to maintain solvency for moderately adverse experience. The difference between the statutory reserve and the amount necessary to maintain solvency for moderately adverse experience is considered to be the non-economic portion of the statutory reserve.\nThe Company uses affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiaries to finance the portion of the statutory reserves required to be held under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX that is considered to be non-economic. The financing arrangements involve the reinsurance of term and universal life business to our affiliated captive reinsurers and the issuance of surplus notes by those affiliated captives that are treated as capital for statutory purposes. These surplus notes are subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of principal and interest on the surplus notes can only be made with prior insurance regulatory approval.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the affiliated captive reinsurance companies have entered into agreements with external counterparties providing for the issuance of up to an aggregate of $14,825 million of surplus notes by our affiliated captive reinsurers in return for the receipt of credit-linked notes ( Credit-Linked Note Structures\u201d), of which $12,919 million of surplus notes was outstanding, compared to an aggregate issuance capacity of $13,700 million, of which $12,009 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The amounts reflect a $1,200 million Credit-Linked Note Structure entered into in June 2020 for Guideline AXXX reserves, of which $700 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Under the agreements, the affiliated captive receives in exchange for the surplus notes one or more credit-linked notes issued by a special-purpose affiliate of the Company with an aggregate principal amount equal to the surplus notes outstanding. The affiliated captive holds the credit-linked notes as assets supporting Regulation XXX or Guideline AXXX non-economic reserves, as applicable. The captive can redeem the principal amount of the outstanding credit-linked notes for cash upon the occurrence of, and in an amount necessary to remedy, a specified liquidity stress event affecting the captive. Under the agreements, the external counterparties have agreed to fund any such payments under the credit-linked notes in return for the receipt of fees. Under certain of the transactions, Prudential Financial has agreed to make capital contributions to the captive to reimburse it for investment losses in excess of specified amounts and/or has agreed to reimburse the external counterparties for any payments made under the credit-linked notes. To date, no such payments under the credit-linked notes have been required. Under these transactions, because valid rights of set-off exist, interest and principal payments on the surplus notes and on the credit-linked notes are settled on a net basis, and the surplus notes are reflected in the Company's total consolidated borrowings on a net basis.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our affiliated captive reinsurance companies had outstanding an aggregate of $2.8 billion of debt issued for the purpose of financing Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX non-economic reserves, of which approximately $1.2 billion relates to Regulation XXX reserves and approximately $1.6 billion relates to Guideline AXXX reserves. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, for purposes of financing Guideline AXXX reserves, one of our affiliated captives had approximately $4.0 billion of surplus notes outstanding that were issued to affiliates.\nThe Company has introduced updated versions of its individual life products in conjunction with the requirement to adopt principle-based reserving by January 1, 2020. These updated products are currently priced to support the principle-based statutory reserve level without the need for reserve financing. Certain elements of the implementation of principle-based reserving are yet to be finalized by the NAIC and may have a material impact on statutory reserves. The Company continues to assess the impact of the implementation of principle-based reserving on projected statutory reserve levels, product pricing and the use of financing.", "summary": "- The

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" included below the Table of Contents, Risk Factors\u201d, and the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company sells variable annuities, universal life insurance, variable life insurance and term life insurance primarily through affiliated and unaffiliated distributors in the United States.\nCOVID-19\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) created extreme stress and disruption in the global economy and financial markets and elevated mortality and morbidity experience for the global population. These events impacted our results of operations throughout 2020 and are expected to impact our results of operations in 2021. The Company has taken several measures to manage the impacts of this crisis. The actual and expected impacts of these events and other items are included in the following update:\n\u2022Outlook. We expect COVID-19 to continue to contribute to elevated levels of mortality, resulting in increased life insurance claims in the near-term. We have taken pricing and product actions to ensure we realize appropriate returns for the current economic environment, and to diversify our product mix to further limit our sensitivity to interest rates, while maintaining a solid value proposition for our customers. These actions included the suspension in July 2020 of our single life guaranteed universal life product, and a pivot to less rate-sensitive annuities products with the decision to discontinue sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits effective December 31, 2020. In addition, while our distribution platforms include a suite of digital, hybrid, and in-person options, mandated social distancing has limited in-person engagement between customers and financial professionals. Collectively, we expect the product actions we have taken and the constrained distribution environment to adversely impact our sales prospects in the near-term.\n\u2022Results of Operations. For the year ended 2020, we reported a net gain of $197 million, inclusive of the unfavorable financial market conditions and COVID-19 related claims that impacted our reported results. See Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of results for the full year of 2020.\n\u2022Liquidity. The impact of COVID-19 and related market dislocations could strain our existing liquidity and cause us to increase the use of our alternative sources of liquidity, which could result in increased financial leverage on our balance sheet and negatively impact our credit and financial strength ratings or ratings outlooks. See Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity\u201d for a discussion of our liquidity.\n\u2022Capital Resources. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained capital levels consistent with our ratings targets; however, market conditions could negatively impact our statutory capital and constrain our overall capital flexibility. Adverse market conditions could require us to take additional management actions to maintain capital consistent with our ratings objectives, which may include redeploying financial resources from internal sources, or using available affiliate sources of capital or seeking additional sources. See Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital\u201d for a discussion of our capital resources.\n\u2022Risk Factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our results of operations, financial position, investment portfolio, new business opportunities and operations, and these impacts are expected to continue. For additional information on the risks to our business posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, see Risk Factors.\u201d\n\u2022Business Continuity. One of the main impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has been executing Prudential Financial Inc.'s (\"Prudential Financial\") and our business continuity protocols to ensure our employees are safe and able to serve our customers. This included effectively transitioning the vast majority of our employees to remote work arrangements.\nWe believe we can sustain remote work and social distancing for an indefinite period while ensuring that critical business operations are sustained. In addition, we are managing COVID-19-related impacts on third-party provided services, and do not anticipate significant interruption in critical operations.\n\u2022CARES Act and Other Regulatory Developments. In March 2020 Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"the CARES Act\"), which provides $2 trillion in economic stimulus to taxpayers, small businesses, and corporations through various grant and loan programs, tax provisions and regulatory relief. One provision of the CARES Act amends the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") and allows companies with net operating losses ( NOLs\u201d) originating in 2018, 2019 or 2020 to carry back those losses for five years. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOther governments and regulators, including the NAIC and state insurance regulators, have implemented, or are considering, a number of actions in response to the crisis, including delaying implementation of certain regulatory changes, temporarily waiving certain regulatory requirements and requiring or requesting insurers to waive premium payments and policy provisions and exclusions for certain periods of time.\nThe Company is not aware of any new or proposed government mandates that could materially impact the Company's solvency or liquidity position.\nRevenues and Expenses\nThe Company earns revenues principally from insurance premiums, mortality and expense fees, asset administration fees from insurance and investment products, and from net investment income on the investment of general account and other funds. The Company receives premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and annuity products. The Company earns mortality and expense fees, and asset administration fees, primarily from the sale and servicing of universal life insurance and separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities. The Company's operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided and reserves established for anticipated future insurance benefits, general business expenses, reinsurance premiums, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products sold and interest credited on general account liabilities.\nIndustry Trends\nOur business is impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight, and a variety of trends that affect the industries where we compete.\nFinancial and Economic Environment. Interest rates in the U.S. have experienced a sustained period of historically low levels, which continue to negatively impact our investment-related activity, including our investment income returns, net investment spread results, and portfolio income and reinvestment yields. See Impact of a Low Interest Rate Environment\u201d below. In addition, we are subject to financial impacts associated with movements in equity markets and the evolution of the credit cycle as discussed in Risk Factors\u201d.\nDemographics. Customer demographics continue to evolve and new opportunities present themselves in different consumer segments such as the millennial and multicultural markets. Consumer expectations and preferences are changing. We believe existing customers and potential customers are increasingly looking for cost-effective solutions that they can easily understand and access through technology-enabled devices. At the same time, income protection, wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers are continuing to shape the insurance industry. A persistent retirement security gap exists in terms of both savings and protection. Despite the ongoing phenomenon of the risk and responsibility of retirement savings shifting from employers to employees, employers are becoming increasingly focused on the financial wellness of the individuals they employ.\nRegulatory Environment. See Business-Regulation\u201d for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the Company and the associated risks.\nCompetitive Environment. See Business\u201d for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which we compete.\nImpact of a Low Interest Rate Environment\nAs a global financial services company, market interest rates are a key driver of the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Changes in interest rates can affect our results of operations and/or our financial condition in several ways, including favorable or adverse impacts to:\n\u2022investment-related activity, including: investment income returns, net interest margins, net investment spread results,\nnew money rates, mortgage loan prepayments and bond redemptions;\n\u2022hedging costs and other risk mitigation activities;\n\u2022insurance reserve levels, market experience true-ups and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ( DAC\u201d);\n\u2022customer account values, including their impact on fee income;\n\u2022product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and\n\u2022policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.\nFor more information on interest rate risks, see \"Risk Factors-Market Risk\".\nAccounting Policies & Pronouncements\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. If management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, the Company's results of operations and financial position as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements could change significantly.\nThe following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.\nInsurance Assets\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Deferred Sales Inducements\nWe capitalize costs that are directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance and annuity contracts. These costs primarily include commissions, as well as costs of policy issuance and underwriting and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully negotiated contracts. We have also deferred costs associated with sales inducements offered in the past related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts. Sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholders' account balances mainly as an inducement to purchase the contract. For additional information about sales inducements, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We generally amortize DAC and deferred sales inducements (\"DSI\") over the expected lives of the contracts, based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross premiums or gross profits, depending on the type of contract. As described in more detail below, in calculating DAC and DSI amortization we are required to make assumptions about investment returns, mortality, persistency and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross profits or gross premiums. We also periodically evaluate the recoverability of our DAC and DSI. For certain contracts, this evaluation is performed as part of our premium deficiency testing, as discussed further below in Insurance Liabilities-Future Policy Benefits\u201d. As of December 31, 2020, DAC for our life products was $2.4 billion. There were no DAC and DSI balances as of December 31, 2020 for our annuity products due to a series of reinsurance transactions that the Company entered into on April 1, 2016 with Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation (\"PALAC\") and The Prudential Insurance Company of America (\"Prudential Insurance\"). See Note 6, Note 8 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAmortization methodologies\nGross Premiums. DAC associated with term life policies is primarily amortized in proportion to gross premiums. Gross premiums are defined as the premiums charged to a policyholder for an insurance contract.\nGross Profits. DAC and DSI associated with the variable and universal life policies and the variable and fixed annuity contracts are generally amortized over the expected lives of these policies in proportion to total gross profits. Total gross profits include both actual gross profits and estimates of gross profits for future periods. Gross profits are defined as (i) amounts assessed for mortality, contract administration, surrender charges, and other assessments plus amounts earned from investment of policyholder balances less (ii) benefits in excess of policyholder balances, costs incurred for contract administration, the net cost of reinsurance for certain products, interest credited to policyholder balances and other credits. If significant negative gross profits are expected in any periods, the amount of insurance in force is generally substituted as the base for computing amortization. U.S. GAAP gross profits and amortization rates also include the impacts of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts, and index-linked crediting features of certain universal life contracts and related hedging activities. In calculating amortization expense, we estimate the amounts of gross profits that will be included in our U.S. GAAP results and utilize these estimates to calculate distinct amortization rates and expense amounts. In addition, in calculating gross profits, we include the profits and losses related to contracts issued by the Company that are reported in affiliated legal entities other than the Company as a result of, for example, reinsurance agreements with those affiliated entities. The Company is an indirect subsidiary of Prudential Financial (an SEC registrant) and has extensive transactions and relationships with other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial, including reinsurance agreements, as discussed in Note 9 and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Incorporating all product-related profits and losses in gross profits, including those that are reported in affiliated legal entities, produces an amortization pattern representative of the total economics of the products. For a further discussion of the amortization of DAC and DSI, see -Results of Operations\u201d.\nWe also regularly evaluate and adjust the related DAC and DSI balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the impact of actual gross profits and changes in our projections of estimated future gross profits on our DAC and DSI amortization rates. Adjustments to the DAC and DSI balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions, our quarterly adjustments for current period experience and our quarterly adjustments for market performance. Each of these adjustments is further discussed below in -Annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments.\u201d\nAnnual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments\nAnnually, we perform a comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods. Over the last several years, the Company's most significant assumption updates that have resulted in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of DAC and DSI have been related to lapse and other contractholder behavior assumptions, mortality, and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments. These assumptions may also cause potential significant variability in amortization expense in the future. The impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nThe quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period. To the extent each period's actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross profits may change. In these cases, we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods' amortization, also referred to as an experience true-up adjustment.\nThe quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and market conditions. A significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts and, to a lesser degree, our variable life contracts are dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. This rate of return influences the fees we earn on variable annuity and variable life contracts, costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts and expected claims to be paid on variable life contracts, as well as other sources of profit. Returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances, which increase the future fees we expect to earn on variable annuity and variable life contracts and decrease the future costs we expect to incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts and expected claims to be paid on variable life contracts. The opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations. The changes in future expected gross profits are used to recognize a cumulative adjustment to all prior periods' amortization.\nThe weighted average rate of return assumptions used in developing estimated market returns consider many factors specific to each product type, including asset durations, asset allocations and other factors. With regard to equity market assumptions, the near-term future rate of return assumption used in evaluating DAC and DSI for our variable annuity and variable life insurance products is derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider historical equity returns and adjust projected equity returns over an initial future period of five years (the near-term\u201d) so that equity returns converge to the long-term expected rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is greater than our near-term maximum future rate of return of 15.0%, we use our maximum future rate of return. As of December 31, 2020, our variable annuities and variable life insurance businesses assume an 8.0% long-term equity expected rate of return and a 1.3% near-term mean reversion equity expected rate of return.\nWith regard to interest rate assumptions used in evaluating DAC and DSI, we update the long-term and near-term future rates used to project fixed income returns annually and quarterly, respectively. As a result of our 2020 annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, we reduced our long-term expectation of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate by 50 basis points and now grade to a rate of 3.25% over ten years. As part of our quarterly market experience updates, we update our near-term projections of interest rates to reflect changes in current rates.\nInsurance Liabilities\nFuture Policy Benefits\nFuture Policy Benefit Reserves, including Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nWe establish reserves for future policy benefits to, or on behalf of, policyholders, using methodologies prescribed by U.S. GAAP. The reserving methodologies used include the following:\n\u2022For most long-duration contracts, we utilize a net premium valuation methodology in measuring the liability for future policy benefits. Under this methodology, a liability for future policy benefits is accrued when premium revenue is recognized. The liability, which represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums (portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses), is estimated using methods that include assumptions applicable at the time the insurance contracts are made with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. Original assumptions continue to be used in subsequent accounting periods to determine changes in the liability for future policy benefits (often referred to as the lock-in concept\u201d), unless a premium deficiency exists. The result of the net premium valuation methodology is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of premiums received to date expected to be needed to fund future benefits (i.e., net premiums received to date), less any benefits and expenses already paid. The liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the Company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that obligation would be funded by net premiums received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. We perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. If the liabilities determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net reserves (i.e., GAAP reserves net of any DAC or DSI asset), the existing net reserves are adjusted by first reducing these assets by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the deficiency is more than these asset balances for insurance contracts, we then increase the net reserves by the excess, again through a charge to current period earnings. If a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions as of the premium deficiency test date are locked-in and used in subsequent valuations and the net reserves continue to be subject to premium deficiency testing. In addition, for limited-payment contracts, future policy benefit reserves also include a deferred profit liability representing gross premiums received in excess of net premiums. The deferred profits are generally recognized in revenue in a constant relationship with insurance in force or with the amount of expected future benefit payments.\n\u2022For certain contract features, such as those related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ( GMDB\u201d), guaranteed minimum income benefits ( GMIB\u201d) and no-lapse guarantees, a liability is established when associated assessments (which include policy charges for administration, mortality, expense, surrender, and other, regardless of how characterized) are recognized. This liability is established using current best estimate assumptions and is based on the ratio of the present value of total expected excess payments (e.g., payments in excess of account value) over the life of the contract divided by the present value of total expected assessments (i.e., benefit ratio). The liability equals the current benefit ratio multiplied by cumulative assessments recognized to date, plus interest, less cumulative excess payments to date. The result of the benefit ratio method is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of assessments received to date expected to be needed to fund future excess payments, less any excess payments already paid. The liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the Company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that excess payment would be funded by assessments received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. Similar to as described above for DAC, the reserves are subject to adjustments based on annual reviews of assumptions and quarterly adjustments for experience, including market performance. These adjustments reflect the impact on the benefit ratio of using actual historical experience from the issuance date to the balance sheet date plus updated estimates of future experience. The updated benefit ratio is then applied to all prior periods' assessments to derive an adjustment to the reserve recognized through a benefit or charge to current period earnings.\n\u2022For certain product guarantees, primarily certain optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ( GMAB\u201d), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ( GMWB\u201d) and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits ( GMIWB\u201d), the benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives using a fair value accounting framework. The fair value of these contracts is calculated as the present value of expected future benefit payments to contractholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. Under U.S. GAAP, the fair values of these benefit features are based on assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these embedded derivatives. Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded quarterly through a benefit or charge to current period earnings. For additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe assumptions used in establishing reserves are generally based on the Company's experience, industry experience and/or other factors, as applicable. We update our actuarial assumptions, such as mortality and policyholder behavior assumptions annually, unless a material change is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long-term trend. Generally, we do not expect trends to change significantly in the short-term and, to the extent these trends may change, we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term. In a sustained low interest rate environment, there is an increased likelihood that the reserves determined based on best estimate assumptions may be greater than the net liabilities.\nThe following paragraphs provide additional details about the reserves we have established:\nThe reserves for future policy benefits of our individual annuity business relate to reserves for the GMDB and GMIB features of our variable annuities, and for the optional living benefit features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. As discussed above, in establishing reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. The primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include annuitization, lapse, withdrawal and mortality assumptions, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. Lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on the in-the-moneyness of the living benefit and reflect other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. Lapse rates are reduced when contracts are more in-the-money. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply. For life contingent payout annuity contracts, we establish reserves using best estimate assumptions with provisions for adverse deviations as of inception or best estimate assumptions as of the most recent loss recognition event.\nThe reserves for certain optional living benefit features, including GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value, as described above. This methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, given changing capital market conditions and various actuarial assumptions. Since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. The models are based on a risk neutral valuation framework and incorporate premiums for risks inherent in valuation techniques, inputs, and the general uncertainty around the timing and amount of future cash flows. The significant inputs to the valuation models for these embedded derivatives include capital market assumptions, such as interest rate levels and volatility assumptions, the Company's market-perceived risk of its own non-performance risk ( NPR\u201d), as well as actuarially determined assumptions, including mortality rates and contractholder behavior, such as lapse rates, benefit utilization rates and withdrawal rates. Capital market inputs and actual contractholders' account values are updated each quarter based on capital market conditions as of the end of the quarter, including interest rates, equity markets and volatility. In the risk neutral valuation, the initial swap curve drives the total returns used to grow the contractholders' account values. The Company's discount rate assumption is based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) swap curve adjusted for an additional spread, which includes an estimate of NPR. Actuarial assumptions, including contractholder behavior and mortality, are reviewed at least annually and updated based upon emerging experience, future expectations and other data, including any observable market data, such as available industry studies or market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. For additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe reserves for future policy benefits of our individual life business relate to term life, universal life and variable life products. For term life contracts, the future policy benefit reserves are generally calculated using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. The primary assumptions used in determining expected future benefits and expenses include mortality, lapse, investment yield and maintenance expense assumptions. For variable and universal life products, which include universal life contracts that contain no-lapse guarantees, reserves for future policy benefits are primarily established using the reserving methodology for GMDB and GMIB contracts. As discussed above, in establishing reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. The primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include mortality, lapse, and premium pattern, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported.\nPolicyholders' Account Balances\nPolicyholders' account balances liability represents the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date. This liability is primarily associated with the accumulated account deposits, plus interest credited, less policyholder withdrawals and other charges assessed against the account balance, as applicable. The liability also includes provisions for benefits under non-life contingent payout annuities. Our unearned revenue reserve ( URR\u201d), also reported as a component of Policyholders' account balances\u201d, gross of reinsurance with a partial offset in Reinsurance recoverables\u201d. The URR balance was $1,378 million as of December 31, 2020. This reserve primarily relates to the variable and universal life products and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods. The charges are deferred as unearned revenue and are generally amortized over the expected life of the contract in proportion to the product's estimated gross profits, similar to DAC and DSI as discussed above. Policyholders' account balances also include amounts representing the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the index-linked features of certain universal life products. For additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSensitivities for Insurance Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table summarizes the impact that could result on each of the listed financial statement balances from changes in certain key assumptions. The information below is for illustrative purposes and includes only the hypothetical direct impact on December 31, 2020 balances of changes in a single assumption and not changes in any combination of assumptions. Additionally, the illustration of the insurance assumption impacts below reflects a parallel shift in the insurance assumptions; however, these may be non-parallel in practice. Changes in current assumptions could result in impacts to financial statement balances that are in excess of the amounts illustrated. A description of the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of each of these financial statement balances is provided above. For traditional long-duration and limited-payment contracts, U.S. GAAP requires the original assumptions used when the contracts are issued to be locked-in and that those assumptions be used in all future liability calculations as long as the resulting liabilities are adequate to provide for the future benefits and expenses (i.e., there is no premium deficiency). Therefore, these products are not reflected in the sensitivity table below unless the hypothetical change in assumption would result in an adverse impact that would cause a premium deficiency. Similarly, the impact of any favorable change in assumptions for traditional long duration and limited-payment contracts is not reflected in the table below given that the current assumption is required to remain locked-in and instead the positive impacts would be recognized into net income over the life of the policies in force.\nThe impacts presented within this table exclude the related impacts of our asset liability management strategy which seeks to offset the changes in the balances presented within this table and is primarily composed of investments and derivatives. See further below for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions involved with the application of U.S. GAAP accounting policies for these instruments and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for hypothetical impacts on related balances as a result of changes in certain significant assumptions.\n\nValuation of Investments, Including Derivatives, Measurement of Allowance for Credit Loss, and the Recognition of Other-than-Temporary Impairments\nOur investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities, other invested assets and derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities. Derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) market. We are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are embedded\u201d in the financial instruments. Management believes the following accounting policies related to investments, including derivatives, are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. Each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to investments and derivatives, as referenced below:\n\u2022Valuation of investments, including derivatives;\n\u2022Measurement of the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, commercial mortgage loans, and other loans; and\n\u2022Recognition of other-than-temporary impairments (\"OTTI\") for equity method investments.\nWe present at fair value in the statements of financial position our debt security investments classified as available-for-sale, investments classified as trading, and certain fixed maturities, equity securities and certain investments within Other invested assets,\u201d such as derivatives. For additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as derivative instruments, embedded derivatives and other investments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor our investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d ( AOCI\u201d), a separate component of equity. For our investments classified as trading and equity securities, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within Other income\u201d. Our commercial mortgage and other loans are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses and unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses.\nIn addition, an allowance for credit losses is measured each quarter for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans. For additional information regarding our policies regarding the measurement of credit losses, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor equity method investments, the carrying value of these investments is written down or impaired to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. For additional information regarding our OTTI policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTaxes on Income\nOur effective tax rate is based on income, non-taxable and non-deductible items, tax credits, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. The Dividend Received Deduction ( DRD\u201d) is a major reason for the difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate. The DRD is an estimate that incorporates the prior and current year information, as well as the current year's equity market performance. Both the current estimate of the DRD and the DRD in future periods can vary based on factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the amount of dividends received that are eligible for the DRD, changes in the amount of distributions received from underlying fund investments, changes in the account balances of variable life and annuity contracts, and the Company's taxable income before the DRD.\nIn December 2017, Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d ( SAB 118\u201d), which allowed the registrants to record provisional amounts during a \u2018measurement period' not to extend beyond one year. Under the relief provided by SAB 118, a company could recognize provisional amounts when it did not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of refinements to provisional amounts related to The United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( Tax Act of 2017\u201d) included in Income tax expense (benefit) before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures\u201d in 2018.\nAn increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percentage point would have resulted in a decrease or increase in our 2020 \"Income tax expense (benefit)\" of $1 million.\nThe CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) was enacted into law. One provision of the CARES Act amends the Tax Act of 2017 and allows companies with net operating losses ( NOLs\u201d) originating in 2018, 2019, or 2020 to carry back those losses up to five years. For 2020, the Company has recorded an income tax benefit of $70 million from carrying the estimated 2020 NOL back to tax years that have a 35% tax rate.\nContingencies\nA contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. Under U.S. GAAP, accruals for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated, such as in connection with an unresolved legal matter. The initial reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and, ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2018-12, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) on August 15, 2018 and is expected to have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-09, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date to affirm its decision to defer the effective date of ASU 2018-12 to January 1, 2022 (with early adoption permitted), representing a one year extension from the original effective date of January 1, 2021. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in November 2020 the FASB issued ASU 2020-11, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date and Early Application to defer for an additional one year the effective date of ASU 2018-12 from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023, and to provide transition relief to facilitate the early adoption of the ASU. The transition relief would allow large calendar-year public companies that early adopt ASU 2018-12 to apply the guidance either as of January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021, respectively) in the 2022 financial statements. Companies that do not early adopt ASU 2018-12 would apply the guidance as of January 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of January 1, 2021) in the 2023 financial statements. The Company currently intends to adopt ASU 2018-12 effective January 1, 2023. ASU 2018-12 will impact, at least to some extent, the accounting and disclosure requirements for all long-duration insurance and investment contracts issued by the Company. In addition to the impacts to the balance sheet upon adoption, the Company also expects an impact to how earnings emerge thereafter. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of ASU 2018-12, as well as other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted and newly adopted accounting pronouncements.\nChanges in Financial Position\n2020 to 2019 Annual Comparison\nTotal assets increased $17 billion from $191 billion at December 31, 2019 to $208 billion at December 31, 2020. Significant components were:\n\u2022Reinsurance recoverables increased $8 billion primarily related to the variable annuity reinsured living benefit liabilities resulting from an increase in future expected benefit payments driven by declining interest rates, partially offset by favorable equity market performance, in addition to unfavorable universal life guaranteed minimum death benefit reserves from ongoing adverse insurance and investment assumption updates;\n\u2022Separate account assets increased $7 billion primarily driven by favorable market performance, partially offset by net outflows and policy charges; and\n\u2022Total investments and Cash and cash equivalents increased $2 billion primarily driven by capital contributions of $575 million to fund additional reserve requirements and unrealized gains on investments due to tightening credit spreads.\nTotal liabilities increased $16 billion from $188 billion at December 31, 2019 to $204 billion at December 31, 2020. Significant components were:\n\u2022Future policy benefits increased $8 billion primarily driven by an increase in the variable annuity living benefit liabilities and ongoing impacts from assumption updates, as discussed above, and business growth on the universal life business;\n\u2022Separate account liabilities increased $7 billion corresponding to the increase in Separate account assets, as discussed above; and\n\u2022Policyholders' account balances increased $1 billion primarily driven by universal life business growth.\nTotal equity increased $1 billion primarily driven by capital contributions from Prudential Insurance to fund additional reserve requirements, as discussed above.\nResults of Operations\nIncome (loss) from Operations before Income Taxes\n2020 to 2019 Annual Comparison\nIncome from operations before income taxes decreased $91 million from income of $159 million in 2019 to income of $68 million in 2020. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, income decreased $131 million primarily driven by:\n\u2022Higher Policyholders' benefits from an increase in reserves due to continued growth in retained principle-based reserving ( PBR\u201d) products and higher mortality;\nPartially offset by:\n\u2022Higher Policy charges and fee income due to increased variable life sales and higher charges from PBR universal life policies; and\n\u2022Higher Premiums from continued growth in PBR term policies.\nRevenues, Benefits and Expenses\n2020 to 2019 Annual Comparison\nRevenues increased $174 million from a gain of $949 million in 2019 to a gain of $1,123 million in 2020. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update to our assumptions and other refinements, the increase was $136 million primarily driven by:\n\u2022Higher Policy charges and fee income due to increased variable life sales and higher charges from PBR universal life policies;\n\u2022Higher Premiums from continued growth in PBR term policies retained; and\n\u2022Higher Realized investment gains (losses), net driven by an increase in living benefit fees ceded as reserves on the living benefit guarantees increased relatively more than prior year partially offset by losses on fixed maturity investments from tightening credit spreads.\nBenefits and expenses increased $265 million from an expense of $791 million in 2019 to an expense of $1,055 million in 2020. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update to our assumptions and other refinements, the increase was $267 million primarily driven by:\n\u2022Higher Policyholders' benefits from an increase in reserves due to continued growth in retained PBR products and higher mortality; and\n\u2022Higher Interest credited to policyholders' accounts driven by retained business growth and unfavorable impacts from the Indexed Universal Life product's future segment valuation.\nRisks and Risk Mitigants\nVariable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, along with actuarial assumptions such as contractholder mortality, the timing and amount of annuitization and withdrawals, and contract lapses. For these risk exposures, achievement of our expected returns is subject to the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. Prudential Financial manages our exposure to certain risks driven by fluctuations in capital markets primarily through a combination of Product Design Features and an Asset Liability Management Strategy (\"ALM\"), as discussed below. The Company also manages these risk exposures through reinsurance for certain of our variable annuity products. For information on our reinsurance agreements, see Business-Reinsurance\u201d and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefit riders have been discontinued as of December 31, 2020. See Business-Products\u201d section for more information about these products.\nProduct Design Features:\nA portion of the variable annuity contracts that we offer include an asset transfer feature. This feature is implemented at the contract level, and transfers assets between certain variable investment sub-accounts selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond fund sub-account within the separate account. The objective of the asset transfer feature is to reduce our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. The asset transfer feature associated with currently-sold highest daily living benefit products uses a designated bond fund sub-account within the separate account. The transfers are based on a static mathematical formula used with the particular benefit which considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of investment performance on the contractholder's total account value. Other product design features we utilize include, among others, asset allocation restrictions, minimum issuance age requirements and certain limitations on the amount of contractholder purchase payments, as well as a required minimum allocation to our general account for certain of our products. We continue to introduce products that diversify our risk profile and have incorporated provisions in product design allowing frequent revisions of key pricing elements for certain of our products. In addition, there is diversity in our fee arrangements, as certain fees are primarily based on the benefit guarantee amount, the contractholder account value and/or premiums, which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account values to decline.\nAsset Liability Management Strategy (including fixed income instruments and derivatives):\nPALAC and Prudential Insurance employ an ALM strategy that utilizes a combination of both traditional fixed income instruments and derivatives to help defray potential claims associated with our variable annuity living benefit guarantees. The economic liability we manage with this ALM strategy consists of expected living benefit claims under less severe market conditions, which are managed using an ALM strategy through the accumulation of fixed income and derivative instruments, and potential living benefit claims resulting from more severe market conditions, which are hedged using derivative instruments. For our Prudential Defined Income variable annuity, we utilize fixed income instruments to help defray potential claims. For the portion of our ALM strategy executed with derivatives, PALAC and Prudential Insurance enter into a range of exchange-traded and over-the-counter equity and interest rate derivatives, including, but not limited to: equity and treasury futures; total return and interest rate swaps; and options, including equity options, swaptions, and floors and caps. The intent of this strategy is to more efficiently manage the capital and liquidity associated with these products while continuing to mitigate fluctuations in net income due to movements in capital markets. Since the ALM strategy is conducted in PALAC and Prudential Insurance, the results of the strategy do not directly impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nCapital Hedge Program:\nA capital hedge program is employed within PALAC to protect a portion of the overall capital position of the variable annuities business against its exposure to the equity markets. The capital hedge program is conducted using equity derivatives which include equity call and put options, total return swaps and futures contracts. Since the capital hedge program is conducted in PALAC, the results of the strategy do not directly impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nIncome Taxes\nThe differences between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% applicable for 2020, 2019 and 2018, and the reported income tax expense (benefit) are provided in the following table:\n\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate is the ratio of Income tax expense (benefit)\u201d divided by Income (loss) from operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures.\" Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was (191.2)%, (37.2)% and (91.1)%, respectively. For a detailed description of the nature of each significant reconciling item, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in the effective tax rate from (37.2)% in 2019 to (191.2)% in 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in pre-tax income in 2020 and the impact of the CARES Act. The increase in the effective tax rate from (91.1)% in 2018 to (37.2)% in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income in 2019.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe Company's liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest that relate to tax years still subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. The completion of review or the expiration of the Federal statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes. The Company had no unrecognized benefit as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. We do not anticipate any significant changes within the next 12 months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.\nIncome Tax Expense vs. Income Tax Paid in Cash\nIncome tax expense recorded under U.S. GAAP routinely differs from the income taxes paid in cash in any given year. Income tax expense recorded under U.S. GAAP is based on income reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the current period and it includes both current and deferred taxes. Income taxes paid during the year include tax installments made for the current year as well as tax payments and refunds related to prior periods.\nFor additional information on income tax related items, see Business-Regulation\u201d and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the Company. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of our business, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our business, general economic conditions, our ability to borrow from affiliates and our access to the capital markets through affiliates as described herein.\nOur businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by domestic and international regulators. These regulations currently include requirements (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making) relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, stress-testing, overall risk management, credit exposure reporting and credit concentration. For information on these regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on us, see Business-Regulation\" and Risk Factors\".\nCOVID-19 and Related Market Disruptions\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, broad market concerns over the impact of COVID-19 have led to significant volatility and disruptions in the global economy and financial markets. In 2020, we took the following significant management actions that impacted our liquidity and capital position, including in response to this macro environment and the global pandemic:\n\u2022We accelerated our product diversification strategy and repriced certain products, which are expected to support the capital position over time.\nLiquidity. The Company continues to operate with significant liquid resources; nevertheless, adverse developments related to COVID-19 and associated market dislocations could strain our existing liquidity. Any need to increase the use of our alternative sources of liquidity, may result in increased financial leverage on our balance sheet and negatively impact our credit and financial strength ratings or ratings outlooks.\nCapital. As of December 31, 2020, the Company maintained capital levels consistent with its ratings targets. However, market conditions could negatively impact the statutory capital and constrain our overall capital flexibility. For example, adverse market conditions may lead to increased defaults and/or further deterioration in the credit quality or fair values of our investment portfolio, which would negatively impact the statutory capital of the Company and its insurance subsidiary. Adverse market conditions could require us to take additional management actions to maintain capital consistent with ratings objectives, which may include redeploying financial resources from internal sources or, using available external sources of capital or seeking additional sources.\nLiquidity and Capital Risk Management. Effective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the organization. Management monitors the liquidity of the Company on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon. We use a Risk Appetite Framework ( RAF\u201d) to ensure that all risks taken by the Company aligns with our capacity and willingness to take those risks. The RAF provides a dynamic assessment of capital and liquidity stress impacts, including scenarios similar to, and more severe than, those occurring due to COVID-19, and is intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available to absorb those impacts. We believe that our capital and liquidity resources are sufficient to satisfy the capital and liquidity requirements of the Company.\nCapital\nWe manage the Company to regulatory capital levels consistent with our \"AA\" ratings targets. We utilize the risk-based capital ( RBC\u201d) ratio as a primary measure of capital adequacy. RBC is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with the practices of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\"). RBC considers, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer's products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring an insurer's solvency and ability to pay future claims. The reporting of RBC measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities, but is available to the public. The Company's capital levels substantially exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations. Our regulatory capital levels may be affected in the future by changes to the applicable regulations, proposals for which are currently under consideration by both domestic and international insurance regulators.\nThe regulatory capital level of the Company can be materially impacted by interest rate and equity market fluctuations, changes in the values of derivatives, the level of impairments recorded, and credit quality migration of the investment portfolio, among other items. In addition, the reinsurance of business or the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by, or credit quality migration affecting, the reinsurers or for other reasons could negatively impact regulatory capital levels. The Company's regulatory capital level is also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator.\nAffiliated Captive Reinsurance Companies\nPrudential Financial and the Company use captive reinsurance companies for our individual life business to more effectively manage our reserves and capital on an economic basis and to enable the aggregation and transfer of risks. The captive reinsurance companies assume business from affiliates only. To support the risks they assume, the captives are capitalized to a level we believe is consistent with the AA\u201d financial strength rating targets of Prudential Financial's insurance subsidiaries. All of the captive reinsurance companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial and are located domestically, typically in the state of domicile of the direct writing insurance subsidiary that cedes the majority of business to the captive. In addition to state insurance regulation, the captives are subject to internal policies governing their activities. In the normal course of business, Prudential Financial contributes capital to the captives to support business growth and other needs. Prudential Financial has also entered into support agreements with several of the captives in connection with financing arrangements.\nOur life insurance subsidiaries are subject to a regulation entitled Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation,\u201d commonly known as Regulation XXX,\u201d and a supporting guideline entitled The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation,\u201d commonly known as Guideline AXXX.\u201d The regulation and supporting guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees at a level that exceeds what our actuarial assumptions for this business would otherwise require. Prudential Financial uses captive reinsurance companies to finance the portion of the reserves for this business that we consider to be non-economic as described below under -Financing Activities-Term and Universal Life Reserve Financing.\u201d\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, as described more fully below, including portfolios of liquid assets. Our investment portfolios are integral to the overall liquidity of the Company. We use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet projected cash outflows, including claims. The impact of Prudential Funding, LLC's (\"Prudential Funding\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, financing capacity on liquidity is considered in the internal liquidity measures of the Company.\nLiquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (e.g., type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our liquidity under various stress scenarios, including company-specific and market-wide events. We continue to believe that cash generated by ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios.\nThe principal sources of", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" included below the Table of Contents, Risk Factors\u201d, and the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company sells variable annuities, universal life insurance, variable life insurance and term life insurance primarily through affiliated and unaffiliated distributors in the United States.\nCOVID-19\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) created extreme stress and disruption in the global economy and financial markets and elevated mortality and morbidity experience for the global population. These events impacted our results of operations throughout 2020 and are expected to impact our results of operations in 2021. The Company has taken several measures to manage the impacts of this crisis. The actual and expected impacts of these events and other items are included in the following update:\n\u2022Outlook. We expect COVID-19 to continue to contribute to elevated levels of mortality, resulting in increased life insurance claims in the near-term. We have taken pricing and product actions to ensure we realize appropriate returns for the current economic environment, and to diversify our product mix to further limit our sensitivity to interest rates, while maintaining a solid value proposition for our customers. These actions included the suspension in July 2020 of our single life guaranteed universal life product, and a pivot to less rate-sensitive annuities products with the decision to discontinue sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits effective December 31, 2020. In addition, while our distribution platforms include a suite of digital, hybrid, and in-person options, mandated social distancing has limited in-person engagement between customers and financial professionals. Collectively, we expect the product actions we have taken and the constrained distribution environment to adversely impact our sales prospects in the near-term.\n\u2022Results of Operations. For the year ended 2020, we reported a net gain of $197 million, inclusive of the unfavorable financial market conditions and COVID-19 related claims that impacted our reported results. See Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of results for the full year of 2020.\n\u2022Liquidity. The impact of COVID-19 and related market dislocations could strain our existing liquidity and cause us to increase the use of our alternative sources of liquidity, which could result in increased financial leverage on our balance sheet and negatively impact our credit and financial strength ratings or ratings outlooks. See Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity\u201d for a discussion of our liquidity.\n\u2022Capital Resources. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained capital levels consistent with our ratings targets; however, market conditions could negatively impact our statutory capital and constrain our overall capital flexibility. Adverse market conditions could require us to take additional management actions to maintain capital consistent with our ratings objectives, which may include redeploying financial resources from internal sources, or using available affiliate sources of capital or seeking additional sources. See Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital\u201d for a discussion of our capital resources.\n\u2022Risk Factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our results of operations, financial position, investment portfolio, new business opportunities and operations, and these impacts are expected to continue. For additional information on the risks to our business posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, see Risk Factors.\u201d\n\u2022Business Continuity. One of the main impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has been executing Prudential Financial Inc.'s (\"Prudential Financial\") and our business continuity protocols to ensure our employees are safe and able to serve our customers. This included effectively transitioning the vast majority of our employees to remote work arrangements.\nWe believe we can sustain remote work and social distancing for an indefinite period while ensuring that critical business operations are sustained. In addition, we are managing COVID-19-related impacts on third-party provided services, and do not anticipate significant interruption in critical operations.\n\u2022CARES Act and Other Regulatory Developments. In March 2020 Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"the CARES Act\"), which provides $2 trillion in economic stimulus to taxpayers, small businesses, and corporations through various grant and loan programs, tax provisions and regulatory relief. One provision of the CARES Act amends the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") and allows companies with net operating losses ( NOLs\u201d) originating in 2018, 2019 or 2020 to carry back those losses for five years. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOther governments and regulators, including the NAIC and state insurance regulators, have implemented, or are considering, a number of actions in response to the crisis, including delaying implementation of certain regulatory changes, temporarily waiving certain regulatory requirements and requiring or requesting insurers to waive premium payments and policy provisions and exclusions for certain periods of time.\nThe Company is not aware of any new or proposed government mandates that could materially impact the Company's solvency or liquidity position.\nRevenues and Expenses\nThe Company earns revenues principally from insurance premiums, mortality and expense fees, asset administration fees from insurance and investment products, and from net investment income on the investment of general account and other funds. The Company receives premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and annuity products. The Company earns mortality and expense fees, and asset administration fees, primarily from the sale and servicing of universal life insurance and separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities. The Company's operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided and reserves established for anticipated future insurance benefits, general business expenses, reinsurance premiums, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products sold and interest credited on general account liabilities.\nIndustry Trends\nOur business is impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight, and a variety of trends that affect the industries where we compete.\nFinancial and Economic Environment. Interest rates in the U.S. have experienced a sustained period of historically low levels, which continue to negatively impact our investment-related activity, including our investment income returns, net investment spread results, and portfolio income and reinvestment yields. See Impact of a Low Interest Rate Environment\u201d below. In addition, we are subject to financial impacts associated with movements in equity markets and the evolution of the credit cycle as discussed in Risk Factors\u201d.\nDemographics. Customer demographics continue to evolve and new opportunities present themselves in different consumer segments such as the millennial and multicultural markets. Consumer expectations and preferences are changing. We believe existing customers and potential customers are increasingly looking for cost-effective solutions that they can easily understand and access through technology-enabled devices. At the same time, income protection, wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers are continuing to shape the insurance industry. A persistent retirement security gap exists in terms of both savings and protection. Despite the ongoing phenomenon of the risk and responsibility of retirement savings shifting from employers to employees, employers are becoming increasingly focused on the financial wellness of the individuals they employ.\nRegulatory Environment. See Business-Regulation\u201d for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the Company and the associated risks.\nCompetitive Environment. See Business\u201d for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which we compete.\nImpact of a Low Interest Rate Environment\nAs a global financial services company, market interest rates are a key driver of the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Changes in interest rates can affect our results of operations and/or our financial condition in several ways, including favorable or adverse impacts to:\n\u2022investment-related activity, including: investment income returns, net interest margins, net investment spread results,\nnew money rates, mortgage loan prepayments and bond redemptions;\n\u2022hedging costs and other risk mitigation activities;\n\u2022insurance reserve levels, market experience true-ups and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ( DAC\u201d);\n\u2022customer account values, including their impact on fee income;\n\u2022product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and\n\u2022policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.\nFor more information on interest rate risks, see \"Risk Factors-Market Risk\".\nAccounting Policies & Pronouncements\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. If management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, the Company's results of operations and financial position as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements could change significantly.\nThe following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.\nInsurance Assets\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Deferred Sales Inducements\nWe capitalize costs that are directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance and annuity contracts. These costs primarily include commissions, as well as costs of policy issuance and underwriting and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully negotiated contracts. We have also deferred costs associated with sales inducements offered in the past related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts. Sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholders' account balances mainly as an inducement to purchase the contract. For additional information about sales inducements, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We generally amortize DAC and deferred sales inducements (\"DSI\") over the expected lives of the contracts, based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross premiums or gross profits, depending on the type of contract. As described in more detail below, in calculating DAC and DSI amortization we are required to make assumptions about investment returns, mortality, persistency and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross profits or gross premiums. We also periodically evaluate the recoverability of our DAC and DSI. For certain contracts, this evaluation is performed as part of our premium deficiency testing, as discussed further below in Insurance Liabilities-Future Policy Benefits\u201d. As of December 31, 2020, DAC for our life products was $2.4 billion. There were no DAC and DSI balances as of December 31, 2020 for our annuity products due to a series of reinsurance transactions that the Company entered into on April 1, 2016 with Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation (\"PALAC\") and The Prudential Insurance Company of America (\"Prudential Insurance\"). See Note 6, Note 8 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAmortization methodologies\nGross Premiums. DAC associated with term life policies is primarily amortized in proportion to gross premiums. Gross premiums are defined as the premiums charged to a policyholder for an insurance contract.\nGross Profits. DAC and DSI associated with the variable and universal life policies and the variable and fixed annuity contracts are generally amortized over the expected lives of these policies in proportion to total gross profits. Total gross profits include both actual gross profits and estimates of gross profits for future periods. Gross profits are defined as (i) amounts assessed for mortality, contract administration, surrender charges, and other assessments plus amounts earned from investment of policyholder balances less (ii) benefits in excess of policyholder balances, costs incurred for contract administration, the net cost of reinsurance for certain products, interest credited to policyholder balances and other credits. If significant negative gross profits are expected in any periods, the amount of insurance in force is generally substituted as the base for computing amortization. U.S. GAAP gross profits and amortization rates also include the impacts of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts, and index-linked crediting features of certain universal life contracts and related hedging activities. In calculating amortization expense, we estimate the amounts of gross profits that will be included in our U.S. GAAP results and utilize these estimates to calculate distinct amortization rates and expense amounts. In addition, in calculating gross profits, we include the profits and losses related to contracts issued by the Company that are reported in affiliated legal entities other than the Company as a result of, for example, reinsurance agreements with those affiliated entities. The Company is an indirect subsidiary of Prudential Financial (an SEC registrant) and has extensive transactions and relationships with other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial, including reinsurance agreements, as discussed in Note 9 and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Incorporating all product-related profits and losses in gross profits, including those that are reported in affiliated legal entities, produces an amortization pattern representative of the total economics of the products. For a further discussion of the amortization of DAC and DSI, see -Results of Operations\u201d.\nWe also regularly evaluate and adjust the related DAC and DSI balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the impact of actual gross profits and changes in our projections of estimated future gross profits on our DAC and DSI amortization rates. Adjustments to the DAC and DSI balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions, our quarterly adjustments for current period experience and our quarterly adjustments for market performance. Each of these adjustments is further discussed below in -Annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments.\u201d\nAnnual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments\nAnnually, we perform a comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods. Over the last several years, the Company's most significant assumption updates that have resulted in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of DAC and DSI have been related to lapse and other contractholder behavior assumptions, mortality, and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments. These assumptions may also cause potential significant variability in amortization expense in the future. The impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nThe quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period. To the extent each period's actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross profits may change. In these cases, we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods' amortization, also referred to as an experience true-up adjustment.\nThe quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and market conditions. A significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts and, to a lesser degree, our variable life contracts are dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. This rate of return influences the fees we earn on variable annuity and variable life contracts, costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts and expected claims to be paid on variable life contracts, as well as other sources of profit. Returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances, which increase the future fees we expect to earn on variable annuity and variable life contracts and decrease the future costs we expect to incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts and expected claims to be paid on variable life contracts. The opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations. The changes in future expected gross profits are used to recognize a cumulative adjustment to all prior periods' amortization.\nThe weighted average rate of return assumptions used in developing estimated market returns consider many factors specific to each product type, including asset durations, asset allocations and other factors. With regard to equity market assumptions, the near-term future rate of return assumption used in evaluating DAC and DSI for our variable annuity and variable life insurance products is derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider historical equity returns and adjust projected equity returns over an initial future period of five years (the near-term\u201d) so that equity returns converge to the long-term expected rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is greater than our near-term maximum future rate of return of 15.0%, we use our maximum future rate of return. As of December 31, 2020, our variable annuities and variable life insurance businesses assume an 8.0% long-term equity expected rate of return and a 1.3% near-term mean reversion equity expected rate of return.\nWith regard to interest rate assumptions used in evaluating DAC and DSI, we update the long-term and near-term future rates used to project fixed income returns annually and quarterly, respectively. As a result of our 2020 annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, we reduced our long-term expectation of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate by 50 basis points and now grade to a rate of 3.25% over ten years. As part of our quarterly market experience updates, we update our near-term projections of interest rates to reflect changes in current rates.\nInsurance Liabilities\nFuture Policy Benefits\nFuture Policy Benefit Reserves, including Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nWe establish reserves for future policy benefits to, or on behalf of, policyholders, using methodologies prescribed by U.S. GAAP. The reserving methodologies used include the following:\n\u2022For most long-duration contracts, we utilize a net premium valuation methodology in measuring the liability for future policy benefits. Under this methodology, a liability for future policy benefits is accrued when premium revenue is recognized. The liability, which represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums (portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses), is estimated using methods that include assumptions applicable at the time the insurance contracts are made with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. Original assumptions continue to be used in subsequent accounting periods to determine changes in the liability for future policy benefits (often referred to as the lock-in concept\u201d), unless a premium deficiency exists. The result of the net premium valuation methodology is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of premiums received to date expected to be needed to fund future benefits (i.e., net premiums received to date), less any benefits and expenses already paid. The liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the Company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that obligation would be funded by net premiums received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. We perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. If the liabilities determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net reserves (i.e., GAAP reserves net of any DAC or DSI asset), the existing net reserves are adjusted by first reducing these assets by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the deficiency is more than these asset balances for insurance contracts, we then increase the net reserves by the excess, again through a charge to current period earnings. If a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions as of the premium deficiency test date are locked-in and used in subsequent valuations and the net reserves continue to be subject to premium deficiency testing. In addition, for limited-payment contracts, future policy benefit reserves also include a deferred profit liability representing gross premiums received in excess of net premiums. The deferred profits are generally recognized in revenue in a constant relationship with insurance in force or with the amount of expected future benefit payments.\n\u2022For certain contract features, such as those related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ( GMDB\u201d), guaranteed minimum income benefits ( GMIB\u201d) and no-lapse guarantees, a liability is established when associated assessments (which include policy charges for administration, mortality, expense, surrender, and other, regardless of how characterized) are recognized. This liability is established using current best estimate assumptions and is based on the ratio of the present value of total expected excess payments (e.g., payments in excess of account value) over the life of the contract divided by the present value of total expected assessments (i.e., benefit ratio). The liability equals the current benefit ratio multiplied by cumulative assessments recognized to date, plus interest, less cumulative excess payments to date. The result of the benefit ratio method is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of assessments received to date expected to be needed to fund future excess payments, less any excess payments already paid. The liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the Company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that excess payment would be funded by assessments received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. Similar to as described above for DAC, the reserves are subject to adjustments based on annual reviews of assumptions and quarterly adjustments for experience, including market performance. These adjustments reflect the impact on the benefit ratio of using actual historical experience from the issuance date to the balance sheet date plus updated estimates of future experience. The updated benefit ratio is then applied to all prior periods' assessments to derive an adjustment to the reserve recognized through a benefit or charge to current period earnings.\n\u2022For certain product guarantees, primarily certain optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ( GMAB\u201d), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ( GMWB\u201d) and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits ( GMIWB\u201d), the benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives using a fair value accounting framework. The fair value of these contracts is calculated as the present value of expected future benefit payments to contractholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. Under U.S. GAAP, the fair values of these benefit features are based on assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these embedded derivatives. Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded quarterly through a benefit or charge to current period earnings. For additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe assumptions used in establishing reserves are generally based on the Company's experience, industry experience and/or other factors, as applicable. We update our actuarial assumptions, such as mortality and policyholder behavior assumptions annually, unless a material change is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long-term trend. Generally, we do not expect trends to change significantly in the short-term and, to the extent these trends may change, we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term. In a sustained low interest rate environment, there is an increased likelihood that the reserves determined based on best estimate assumptions may be greater than the net liabilities.\nThe following paragraphs provide additional details about the reserves we have established:\nThe reserves for future policy benefits of our individual annuity business relate to reserves for the GMDB and GMIB features of our variable annuities, and for the optional living benefit features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. As discussed above, in establishing reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. The primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include annuitization, lapse, withdrawal and mortality assumptions, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. Lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on the in-the-moneyness of the living benefit and reflect other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. Lapse rates are reduced when contracts are more in-the-money. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply. For life contingent payout annuity contracts, we establish reserves using best estimate assumptions with provisions for adverse deviations as of inception or best estimate assumptions as of the most recent loss recognition event.\nThe reserves for certain optional living benefit features, including GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value, as described above. This methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, given changing capital market conditions and various actuarial assumptions. Since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. The models are based on a risk neutral valuation framework and incorporate premiums for risks inherent in valuation techniques, inputs, and the general uncertainty around the timing and amount of future cash flows. The significant inputs to the valuation models for these embedded derivatives include capital market assumptions, such as interest rate levels and volatility assumptions, the Company's market-perceived risk of its own non-performance risk ( NPR\u201d), as well as actuarially determined assumptions, including mortality rates and contractholder behavior, such as lapse rates, benefit utilization rates and withdrawal rates. Capital market inputs and actual contractholders' account values are updated each quarter based on capital market conditions as of the end of the quarter, including interest rates, equity markets and volatility. In the risk neutral valuation, the initial swap curve drives the total returns used to grow the contractholders' account values. The Company's discount rate assumption is based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) swap curve adjusted for an additional spread, which includes an estimate of NPR. Actuarial assumptions, including contractholder behavior and mortality, are reviewed at least annually and updated based upon emerging experience, future expectations and other data, including any observable market data, such as available industry studies or market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. For additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe reserves for future policy benefits of our individual life business relate to term life, universal life and variable life products. For term life contracts, the future policy benefit reserves are generally calculated using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. The primary assumptions used in determining expected future benefits and expenses include mortality, lapse, investment yield and maintenance expense assumptions. For variable and universal life products, which include universal life contracts that contain no-lapse guarantees, reserves for future policy benefits are primarily established using the reserving methodology for GMDB and GMIB contracts. As discussed above, in establishing reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. The primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include mortality, lapse, and premium pattern, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported.\nPolicyholders' Account Balances\nPolicyholders' account balances liability represents the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date. This liability is primarily associated with the accumulated account deposits, plus interest credited, less policyholder withdrawals and other charges assessed against the account balance, as applicable. The liability also includes provisions for benefits under non-life contingent payout annuities. Our unearned revenue reserve ( URR\u201d), also reported as a component of Policyholders' account balances\u201d, gross of reinsurance with a partial offset in Reinsurance recoverables\u201d. The URR balance was $1,378 million as of December 31, 2020. This reserve primarily relates to the variable and universal life products and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods. The charges are deferred as unearned revenue and are generally amortized over the expected life of the contract in proportion to the product's estimated gross profits, similar to DAC and DSI as discussed above. Policyholders' account balances also include amounts representing the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the index-linked features of certain universal life products. For additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSensitivities for Insurance Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table summarizes the impact that could result on each of the listed financial statement balances from changes in certain key assumptions. The information below is for illustrative purposes and includes only the hypothetical direct impact on December 31, 2020 balances of changes in a single assumption and not changes in any combination of assumptions. Additionally, the illustration of the insurance assumption impacts below reflects a parallel shift in the insurance assumptions; however, these may be non-parallel in practice. Changes in current assumptions could result in impacts to financial statement balances that are in excess of the amounts illustrated. A description of the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of each of these financial statement balances is provided above. For traditional long-duration and limited-payment contracts, U.S. GAAP requires the original assumptions used when the contracts are issued to be locked-in and that those assumptions be used in all future liability calculations as long as the resulting liabilities are adequate to provide for the future benefits and expenses (i.e., there is no premium deficiency). Therefore, these products are not reflected in the sensitivity table below unless the hypothetical change in assumption would result in an adverse impact that would cause a premium deficiency. Similarly, the impact of any favorable change in assumptions for traditional long duration and limited-payment contracts is not reflected in the table below given that the current assumption is required to remain locked-in and instead the positive impacts would be recognized into net income over the life of the policies in force.\nThe impacts presented within this table exclude the related impacts of our asset liability management strategy which seeks to offset the changes in the balances presented within this table and is primarily composed of investments and derivatives. See further below for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions involved with the application of U.S. GAAP accounting policies for these instruments and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for hypothetical impacts on related balances as a result of changes in certain significant assumptions.\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) in </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs </td> <td> </td> <td>Reinsurance Recoverables </td> <td> </td> <td>Future Policy Benefits and Policyholders' Account Balances </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Impact </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hypothetical change in current assumptions: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 25 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 25 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term equity expected rate of return </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(95) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(85) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NPR credit spread </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,700) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,785) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(120) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortality </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 1% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(175) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(180) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 1% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lapse </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 10% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(700) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(750) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 10% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nValuation of Investments, Including Derivatives, Measurement of Allowance for Credit Loss, and the Recognition of Other-than-Temporary Impairments\nOur investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities, other invested assets and derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities. Derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) market. We are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are embedded\u201d in the financial instruments. Management believes the following accounting policies related to investments, including derivatives, are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. Each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to investments and derivatives, as referenced below:\n\u2022Valuation of investments, including derivatives;\n\u2022Measurement of the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, commercial mortgage loans, and other loans; and\n\u2022Recognition of other-than-temporary impairments (\"OTTI\") for equity method investments.\nWe present at fair value in the statements of financial position our debt security investments classified as available-for-sale, investments classified as trading, and certain fixed maturities, equity securities and certain investments within Other invested assets,\u201d such as derivatives. For additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as derivative instruments, embedded derivatives and other investments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor our investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d ( AOCI\u201d), a separate component of equity. For our investments classified as trading and equity securities, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within Other income\u201d. Our commercial mortgage and other loans are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses and unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses.\nIn addition, an allowance for credit losses is measured each quarter for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans. For additional information regarding our policies regarding the measurement of credit losses, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor equity method investments, the carrying value of these investments is written down or impaired to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. For additional information regarding our OTTI policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTaxes on Income\nOur effective tax rate is based on income, non-taxable and non-deductible items, tax credits, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. The Dividend Received Deduction ( DRD\u201d) is a major reason for the difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate. The DRD is an estimate that incorporates the prior and current year information, as well as the current year's equity market performance. Both the current estimate of the DRD and the DRD in future periods can vary based on factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the amount of dividends received that are eligible for the DRD, changes in the amount of distributions received from underlying fund investments, changes in the account balances of variable life and annuity contracts, and the Company's taxable income before the DRD.\nIn December 2017, Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d ( SAB 118\u201d), which allowed the registrants to record provisional amounts during a \u2018measurement period' not to extend beyond one year. Under the relief provided by SAB 118, a company could recognize provisional amounts when it did not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of refinements to provisional amounts related to The United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( Tax Act of 2017\u201d) included in Income tax expense (benefit) before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures\u201d in 2018.\nAn increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percentage point would have resulted in a decrease or increase in our 2020 \"Income tax expense (benefit)\" of $1 million.\nThe CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) was enacted into law. One provision of the CARES Act amends the Tax Act of 2017 and allows companies with net operating losses ( NOLs\u201d) originating in 2018, 2019, or 2020 to carry back those losses up to five years. For 2020, the Company has recorded an income tax benefit of $70 million from carrying the estimated 2020 NOL back to tax years that have a 35% tax rate.\nContingencies\nA contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. Under U.S. GAAP, accruals for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated, such as in connection with an unresolved legal matter. The initial reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and, ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2018-12, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) on August 15, 2018 and is expected to have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-09, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date to affirm its decision to defer the effective date of ASU 2018-12 to January 1, 2022 (with early adoption permitted), representing a one year extension from the original effective date of January 1, 2021. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in November 2020 the FASB issued ASU 2020-11, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date and Early Application to defer for an additional one year the effective date of ASU 2018-12 from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023, and to provide transition relief to facilitate the early adoption of the ASU. The transition relief would allow large calendar-year public companies that early adopt ASU 2018-12 to apply the guidance either as of January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021, respectively) in the 2022 financial statements. Companies that do not early adopt ASU 2018-12 would apply the guidance as of January 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of January 1, 2021) in the 2023 financial statements. The Company currently intends to adopt ASU 2018-12 effective January 1, 2023. ASU 2018-12 will impact, at least to some extent, the accounting and disclosure requirements for all long-duration insurance and investment contracts issued by the Company. In addition to the impacts to the balance sheet upon adoption, the Company also expects an impact to how earnings emerge thereafter. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of ASU 2018-12, as well as other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted and newly adopted accounting pronouncements.\nChanges in Financial Position\n2020 to 2019 Annual Comparison\nTotal assets increased $17 billion from $191 billion at December 31, 2019 to $208 billion at December 31, 2020. Significant components were:\n\u2022Reinsurance recoverables increased $8 billion primarily related to the variable annuity reinsured living benefit liabilities resulting from an increase in future expected benefit payments driven by declining interest rates, partially offset by favorable equity market performance, in addition to unfavorable universal life guaranteed minimum death benefit reserves from ongoing adverse insurance and investment assumption updates;\n\u2022Separate account assets increased $7 billion primarily driven by favorable market performance, partially offset by net outflows and policy charges; and\n\u2022Total investments and Cash and cash equivalents increased $2 billion primarily driven by capital contributions of $575 million to fund additional reserve requirements and unrealized gains on investments due to tightening credit spreads.\nTotal liabilities increased $16 billion from $188 billion at December 31, 2019 to $204 billion at December 31, 2020. Significant components were:\n\u2022Future policy benefits increased $8 billion primarily driven by an increase in the variable annuity living benefit liabilities and ongoing impacts from assumption updates, as discussed above, and business growth on the universal life business;\n\u2022Separate account liabilities increased $7 billion corresponding to the increase in Separate account assets, as discussed above; and\n\u2022Policyholders' account balances increased $1 billion primarily driven by universal life business growth.\nTotal equity increased $1 billion primarily driven by capital contributions from Prudential Insurance to fund additional reserve requirements, as discussed above.\nResults of Operations\nIncome (loss) from Operations before Income Taxes\n2020 to 2019 Annual Comparison\nIncome from operations before income taxes decreased $91 million from income of $159 million in 2019 to income of $68 million in 2020. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, income decreased $131 million primarily driven by:\n\u2022Higher Policyholders' benefits from an increase in reserves due to continued growth in retained principle-based reserving ( PBR\u201d) products and higher mortality;\nPartially offset by:\n\u2022Higher Policy charges and fee income due to increased variable life sales and higher charges from PBR universal life policies; and\n\u2022Higher Premiums from continued growth in PBR term policies.\nRevenues, Benefits and Expenses\n2020 to 2019 Annual Comparison\nRevenues increased $174 million from a gain of $949 million in 2019 to a gain of $1,123 million in 2020. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update to our assumptions and other refinements, the increase was $136 million primarily driven by:\n\u2022Higher Policy charges and fee income due to increased variable life sales and higher charges from PBR universal life policies;\n\u2022Higher Premiums from continued growth in PBR term policies retained; and\n\u2022Higher Realized investment gains (losses), net driven by an increase in living benefit fees ceded as reserves on the living benefit guarantees increased relatively more than prior year partially offset by losses on fixed maturity investments from tightening credit spreads.\nBenefits and expenses increased $265 million from an expense of $791 million in 2019 to an expense of $1,055 million in 2020. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update to our assumptions and other refinements, the increase was $267 million primarily driven by:\n\u2022Higher Policyholders' benefits from an increase in reserves due to continued growth in retained PBR products and higher mortality; and\n\u2022Higher Interest credited to policyholders' accounts driven by retained business growth and unfavorable impacts from the Indexed Universal Life product's future segment valuation.\nRisks and Risk Mitigants\nVariable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, along with actuarial assumptions such as contractholder mortality, the timing and amount of annuitization and withdrawals, and contract lapses. For these risk exposures, achievement of our expected returns is subject to the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. Prudential Financial manages our exposure to certain risks driven by fluctuations in capital markets primarily through a combination of Product Design Features and an Asset Liability Management Strategy (\"ALM\"), as discussed below. The Company also manages these risk exposures through reinsurance for certain of our variable annuity products. For information on our reinsurance agreements, see Business-Reinsurance\u201d and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefit riders have been discontinued as of December 31, 2020. See Business-Products\u201d section for more information about these products.\nProduct Design Features:\nA portion of the variable annuity contracts that we offer include an asset transfer feature. This feature is implemented at the contract level, and transfers assets between certain variable investment sub-accounts selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond fund sub-account within the separate account. The objective of the asset transfer feature is to reduce our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. The asset transfer feature associated with currently-sold highest daily living benefit products uses a designated bond fund sub-account within the separate account. The transfers are based on a static mathematical formula used with the particular benefit which considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of investment performance on the contractholder's total account value. Other product design features we utilize include, among others, asset allocation restrictions, minimum issuance age requirements and certain limitations on the amount of contractholder purchase payments, as well as a required minimum allocation to our general account for certain of our products. We continue to introduce products that diversify our risk profile and have incorporated provisions in product design allowing frequent revisions of key pricing elements for certain of our products. In addition, there is diversity in our fee arrangements, as certain fees are primarily based on the benefit guarantee amount, the contractholder account value and/or premiums, which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account values to decline.\nAsset Liability Management Strategy (including fixed income instruments and derivatives):\nPALAC and Prudential Insurance employ an ALM strategy that utilizes a combination of both traditional fixed income instruments and derivatives to help defray potential claims associated with our variable annuity living benefit guarantees. The economic liability we manage with this ALM strategy consists of expected living benefit claims under less severe market conditions, which are managed using an ALM strategy through the accumulation of fixed income and derivative instruments, and potential living benefit claims resulting from more severe market conditions, which are hedged using derivative instruments. For our Prudential Defined Income variable annuity, we utilize fixed income instruments to help defray potential claims. For the portion of our ALM strategy executed with derivatives, PALAC and Prudential Insurance enter into a range of exchange-traded and over-the-counter equity and interest rate derivatives, including, but not limited to: equity and treasury futures; total return and interest rate swaps; and options, including equity options, swaptions, and floors and caps. The intent of this strategy is to more efficiently manage the capital and liquidity associated with these products while continuing to mitigate fluctuations in net income due to movements in capital markets. Since the ALM strategy is conducted in PALAC and Prudential Insurance, the results of the strategy do not directly impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nCapital Hedge Program:\nA capital hedge program is employed within PALAC to protect a portion of the overall capital position of the variable annuities business against its exposure to the equity markets. The capital hedge program is conducted using equity derivatives which include equity call and put options, total return swaps and futures contracts. Since the capital hedge program is conducted in PALAC, the results of the strategy do not directly impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nIncome Taxes\nThe differences between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% applicable for 2020, 2019 and 2018, and the reported income tax expense (benefit) are provided in the following table:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected federal income tax expense (benefit) at federal statutory rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-taxable investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>(47) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax credits </td> <td> </td> <td>(28) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in tax law </td> <td> </td> <td>(70) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Settlements with taxing authorities </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(130) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(59) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(53) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td>(191.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(37.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(91.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate is the ratio of Income tax expense (benefit)\u201d divided by Income (loss) from operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures.\" Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was (191.2)%, (37.2)% and (91.1)%, respectively. For a detailed description of the nature of each significant reconciling item, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in the effective tax rate from (37.2)% in 2019 to (191.2)% in 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in pre-tax income in 2020 and the impact of the CARES Act. The increase in the effective tax rate from (91.1)% in 2018 to (37.2)% in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income in 2019.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe Company's liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest that relate to tax years still subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. The completion of review or the expiration of the Federal statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes. The Company had no unrecognized benefit as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. We do not anticipate any significant changes within the next 12 months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.\nIncome Tax Expense vs. Income Tax Paid in Cash\nIncome tax expense recorded under U.S. GAAP routinely differs from the income taxes paid in cash in any given year. Income tax expense recorded under U.S. GAAP is based on income reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the current period and it includes both current and deferred taxes. Income taxes paid during the year include tax installments made for the current year as well as tax payments and refunds related to prior periods.\nFor additional information on income tax related items, see Business-Regulation\u201d and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the Company. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of our business, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our business, general economic conditions, our ability to borrow from affiliates and our access to the capital markets through affiliates as described herein.\nOur businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by domestic and international regulators. These regulations currently include requirements (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making) relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, stress-testing, overall risk management, credit exposure reporting and credit concentration. For information on these regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on us, see Business-Regulation\" and Risk Factors\".\nCOVID-19 and Related Market Disruptions\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, broad market concerns over the impact of COVID-19 have led to significant volatility and disruptions in the global economy and financial markets. In 2020, we took the following significant management actions that impacted our liquidity and capital position, including in response to this macro environment and the global pandemic:\n\u2022We accelerated our product diversification strategy and repriced certain products, which are expected to support the capital position over time.\nLiquidity. The Company continues to operate with significant liquid resources; nevertheless, adverse developments related to COVID-19 and associated market dislocations could strain our existing liquidity. Any need to increase the use of our alternative sources of liquidity, may result in increased financial leverage on our balance sheet and negatively impact our credit and financial strength ratings or ratings outlooks.\nCapital. As of December 31, 2020, the Company maintained capital levels consistent with its ratings targets. However, market conditions could negatively impact the statutory capital and constrain our overall capital flexibility. For example, adverse market conditions may lead to increased defaults and/or further deterioration in the credit quality or fair values of our investment portfolio, which would negatively impact the statutory capital of the Company and its insurance subsidiary. Adverse market conditions could require us to take additional management actions to maintain capital consistent with ratings objectives, which may include redeploying financial resources from internal sources or, using available external sources of capital or seeking additional sources.\nLiquidity and Capital Risk Management. Effective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the organization. Management monitors the liquidity of the Company on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon. We use a Risk Appetite Framework ( RAF\u201d) to ensure that all risks taken by the Company aligns with our capacity and willingness to take those risks. The RAF provides a dynamic assessment of capital and liquidity stress impacts, including scenarios similar to, and more severe than, those occurring due to COVID-19, and is intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available to absorb those impacts. We believe that our capital and liquidity resources are sufficient to satisfy the capital and liquidity requirements of the Company.\nCapital\nWe manage the Company to regulatory capital levels consistent with our \"AA\" ratings targets. We utilize the risk-based capital ( RBC\u201d) ratio as a primary measure of capital adequacy. RBC is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with the practices of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\"). RBC considers, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer's products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring an insurer's solvency and ability to pay future claims. The reporting of RBC measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities, but is available to the public. The Company's capital levels substantially exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations. Our regulatory capital levels may be affected in the future by changes to the applicable regulations, proposals for which are currently under consideration by both domestic and international insurance regulators.\nThe regulatory capital level of the Company can be materially impacted by interest rate and equity market fluctuations, changes in the values of derivatives, the level of impairments recorded, and credit quality migration of the investment portfolio, among other items. In addition, the reinsurance of business or the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by, or credit quality migration affecting, the reinsurers or for other reasons could negatively impact regulatory capital levels. The Company's regulatory capital level is also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator.\nAffiliated Captive Reinsurance Companies\nPrudential Financial and the Company use captive reinsurance companies for our individual life business to more effectively manage our reserves and capital on an economic basis and to enable the aggregation and transfer of risks. The captive reinsurance companies assume business from affiliates only. To support the risks they assume, the captives are capitalized to a level we believe is consistent with the AA\u201d financial strength rating targets of Prudential Financial's insurance subsidiaries. All of the captive reinsurance companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial and are located domestically, typically in the state of domicile of the direct writing insurance subsidiary that cedes the majority of business to the captive. In addition to state insurance regulation, the captives are subject to internal policies governing their activities. In the normal course of business, Prudential Financial contributes capital to the captives to support business growth and other needs. Prudential Financial has also entered into support agreements with several of the captives in connection with financing arrangements.\nOur life insurance subsidiaries are subject to a regulation entitled Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation,\u201d commonly known as Regulation XXX,\u201d and a supporting guideline entitled The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation,\u201d commonly known as Guideline AXXX.\u201d The regulation and supporting guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees at a level that exceeds what our actuarial assumptions for this business would otherwise require. Prudential Financial uses captive reinsurance companies to finance the portion of the reserves for this business that we consider to be non-economic as described below under -Financing Activities-Term and Universal Life Reserve Financing.\u201d\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations.
