MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our future results may vary materially from those indicated as a result of the risks that affect our business, including, among others, those identified in Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global provider of connected fleet and mobile asset solutions delivered as Software as a Service ( SaaS\u201d). Our solutions deliver a measurable return by enabling our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in commercial fleets or personal vehicles. We generate actionable insights that enable a wide range of customers, from large enterprise fleets to small fleet operators and consumers, to reduce fuel and other operating costs, improve efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, enhance driver safety, manage risk and mitigate theft. Our solutions mostly rely on our proprietary, highly scalable technology platforms, which allow us to collect, analyze and deliver information based on data from our customers' vehicles. Using an intuitive, web-based interface, dashboards or mobile apps, our fleet customers can access large volumes of real-time and historical data, monitor the location and status of their drivers and vehicles and analyze a wide number of key metrics across their fleet operations.\nWe were founded in 1996 and we have offices in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uganda, Brazil, Australia, Romania, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates as well as a network of more than 130 fleet partners worldwide. MiX Telematics shares are publicly traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE: MIX) and MiX Telematics American Depositary Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: MIXT).\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from subscriptions to our fleet and mobile asset management solutions. Our subscriptions generally include access to our SaaS solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, use of an in-vehicle device. We also generate revenues from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which enable customers to use our subscription-based solutions, installation services of our in-vehicle-devices and driver training for fleet customers. We generate sales through the efforts of our direct sales teams, staffed in our regional sales offices, and through our global network of distributors and dealers. Our direct sales teams focus on marketing our fleet solutions to global and multinational enterprise accounts and to other large customer accounts located in regions of the world where we maintain a direct sales presence. Our direct sales teams have industry expertise across multiple industries, including oil and gas, transportation and logistics, government and municipal, bus and coach, rental and leasing, and utilities. In some markets, we rely on a network of distributors and dealers to sell our solutions on our behalf. Our distributors and dealers also install our in-vehicle devices and provide training, technical support and ongoing maintenance for the customers they support.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in China ( COVID-19\u201d). In January 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of international concern and, subsequently, it was declared a pandemic in March 2020. The outbreak continued to spread globally, affecting global economic activity and financial markets. We have considered the impact of COVID-19 including its impact on expected credit losses and potential goodwill impairments, however numerous uncertainties remain, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact on our customers and other factors identified in Item 1A. Risk Factors - The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nBusiness, employees and operations\nDue to extensive measures implemented by various governments, all of our employees were required to work remotely, with the exception of our staff working in our monitoring centers, which were classified as an essential service. We have implemented appropriate safeguards for these centers. In addition, we have modified certain business and\nworkforce practices (including extended work from home requirements, suspension of certain business travel and cancellation of certain physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and implemented new protocols to promote social distancing and enhance sanitary measures in our offices and facilities to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we implemented various cost-saving measures, including headcount reductions, deferred salary increases, a hiring freeze across the business, and significant reductions in discretionary spending. We started to realize the benefit of these actions in the second quarter. As part of the headcount reductions in fiscal 2021, we incurred a $1.1 million restructuring charge as we committed to plans to restructure certain parts of our business as a measure to minimize the adverse economic and business effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and to re-align resources to our current business outlook and cost structure. The restructuring activities mainly related to the CSO, Africa Middle East and Australasia and North America reporting segments.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted the operations of our customers and channel partners, our operations and the results of our operations. COVID-19 currently has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. For example, the continued economic uncertainty in the oil and gas sector has resulted in significant declines in our customer's fleet sizes whilst similar disruption is evident in our bus and coach vertical following significantly reduced demand for public transport as a result of various governmental shut downs in multiple jurisdictions where we operate. This has and will continue to have a negative impact on our revenue and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. During fiscal year 2021, we experienced a contraction of 73,800 subscribers as a result of the economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The net contraction in subscribers resulted in a decrease in reported subscription revenues.\nCash resources and liquidity\nBased on our internal projections we believe that we have sufficient cash reserves to support us for the foreseeable future. Further details on our cash resources and borrowings available under our credit facilities are provided in the liquidity and capital resources section below.\nFinancial position and impairments\nWe have taken into account the impact of COVID-19, to the extent possible, on our financial statements as of reporting date. However, future changes in economic conditions related to COVID-19 could have an impact on future estimates and judgements used, particularly those relating to Goodwill sensitivities and impairment assessments, as well as expected credit losses. Refer to note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Goodwill sensitivities. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.\nKey Financial Measures and Operating Metrics\nIn addition to financial measures based on our consolidated financial statements, we monitor our business operations using various financial and non-financial metrics.\nSubscription Revenue\nSubscription revenue represents subscription fees for our solutions, which include the use of our SaaS fleet management solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, our in-vehicle devices. Our subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of subscribers and the monthly price per subscriber, which varies depending on the services and features customers require, hardware options, customer size and geographic location.\nSubscription revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue due to a reduction in hardware and other revenue. In fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, subscription revenue represented 85.7%, 87.6% and 89.3% respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, our top 10 customers represented 24.9%, 23.7% and 21.8% respectively, of our subscription revenue.\nSubscribers\nSubscribers represent the total number of discrete services we provide to customers at the end of the period.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscribers </td> <td> </td> <td>750,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>818,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>744,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nLevel of Subscription Revenue and Hardware Revenue\nWe have historically been focused on growing our recurring subscription revenue base and entering into more fully bundled deals. As a result of an increase in the total subscriber base, and due to new and existing subscribers moving to fully-bundled subscriptions, subscription revenue has increased as a percentage of revenue. In fiscal year 2021, subscription-based revenues accounted for 89.3% of our total revenues, up from 87.6% in 2020 and 85.7% in 2019. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the level of business disruption as a result of the spread of COVID-19, the Company suspended its practice of issuing financial guidance during fiscal 2021 and has also not provided guidance for fiscal 2022.\nAs market conditions improve globally, we believe that we will be well positioned to grow our base of subscribers, by adding both fully-bundled subscriptions; subscriptions where the hardware has been purchased upfront and various add-on solutions that can drive incremental average revenue per user ( ARPU\u201d) expansion over time. We intend to maintain our investment in sales and marketing and continue to attract new subscribers by introducing attractive new features and services.\nAdditionally, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our fleet management market share among our existing customer base by demonstrating our value proposition, growing with the customer, introducing new and innovative value-added solutions and displacing legacy fleet management solutions.\nFluctuations in Exchange Rates\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented a substantial portion of our total revenue. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, will negatively affect our reported income and expenses as expressed in U.S. Dollars (our reporting currency). The South African Rand is the functional currency for the Company. Currency fluctuations in the South African Rand may positively or negatively impact our reported income and expenses due to the effects of translating the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries into Rand at different average exchange rates and then translating into our reporting currency of U.S. Dollars.\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Rand weakened by 10.8% against the U.S. Dollar and by 13.7% against the British Pound, as shown in the table below.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Average exchange rate for Fiscal Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South African Rand for U.S. Dollars (per $1.00) </td> <td>13.75 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.78 </td> <td> </td> <td>16.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% movement </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South African Rand for British Pound (per \u00a31.00) </td> <td>18.03 </td> <td> </td> <td>18.78 </td> <td> </td> <td>21.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% movement </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect continued exchange rate volatility in the South African Rand against other major currencies. The South African Rand has been even more volatile due to the uncertain economic conditions including the effect of COVID-19 and it is uncertain how long this will continue. As of June 10, 2021, the South African Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 13.65, 16.6% stronger than the average exchange rate for fiscal 2021.\nMix of Subscribers with Different Revenue and Cost Economics\nWe offer services to a wide range of customers, from large enterprise vehicle fleets to small fleet operators and consumers. The subscription revenue and cost per subscriber and the subscriber retention pattern differ by type of subscriber. For example, our entry-level consumer solution, Beam-e, is characterized by lower revenue and lower cost per subscriber compared to our large enterprise solutions. Small fleet and consumer customers will enter into and terminate contracts much more frequently than our enterprise customers, thereby affecting subscriber retention. As the mix of our subscriber base evolves, the average revenue per subscriber and average cost per subscriber is likely to change.\nVarying Economic Conditions in our Markets\nWe seek to capitalize on opportunities and manage risks in our key markets, which are geographically dispersed with subscribers located in more than 120 countries worldwide. Overall, we believe that our presence across multiple geographic markets and our exposure to multiple economies provides us with diversification from the risk of changing economic conditions in any one country or region. Other macroeconomic factors, such as expectations for future crude oil and natural gas prices, affect our customers' spending habits. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices, or the perception that such prices will decrease in the future, negatively impacts our net subscriber growth and hardware sales in this sector. In addition to macroeconomic changes, performance in any given region may vary due to multiple factors, including growth in subscribers, the overall profile of the customer base (for example, in Africa, we have a significant consumer subscriber base), the services and hardware options selected by particular subscribers and our distribution strategy in the region.\nChanges in regional conditions require management to formulate strategic responses that safeguard our financial position and maintain our balanced approach to producing revenue growth, profitability and cash flow.\nChanging Customer Needs and Ongoing Investment in Technology\nWe continuously analyze market trends and opportunities in the various geographies in which we operate and have identified an opportunity to increase subscription revenue growth by the addition of new products and services in certain of the regions in which we operate. Our investment in software development is core to our business strategy. Our software teams employ an agile software development methodology. We have made a significant investment in product development, and we have routinely been among the first to market with innovative solutions and features that cater to the needs of our customers. For example, major updates to the MiX Vision solution were made in fiscal year 2021, with MiX Vision AI poised for launch in calendar year 2021.\nLong Sales Cycle for Our Enterprise Fleet Management Solutions\nFrom period to period, our revenues may fluctuate depending upon the customer contracts we have secured. The typical sales cycle for large enterprise fleet management solutions contracts may be long, especially in comparison to the sales cycle for our consumer solutions. It may also be difficult for us to predict the timing of when we will enter into enterprise fleet management contracts.\nLonger sales cycles for large contracts, for both customers who purchase in-vehicle devices and those who opt for the fully bundled option, may affect the comparability of financial results in certain segments. Our revenue may fluctuate from period to period depending on the level and timing of hardware sales, while subscription revenue growth is also impacted by the timing of the rollout of large enterprise fleets. We are focused on mitigating these long sales cycles and the associated volatility by enhancing our sales pipeline management process, by increasing our sales and marketing investment levels across all geographical segments and by diversifying our customer segment focus.\nInvestment in Sales and Marketing\nWe offer our solutions in over 120 countries through a combination of our direct and indirect marketing efforts. Our sales and marketing strategy is segmented by geographic region and customer type in order to cost effectively target and acquire new customers. In certain regions, we sell subscriptions of our fleet management solutions to large enterprise fleets through our direct sales force. In other regions, and for sales to small fleet operators and consumers, we work with an extensive distribution network of regional partners and national distribution dealers. Through our central services organization headquartered in South Africa, we provide optimized marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our regional sales and marketing operations. We continue to focus on growth and expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base and to expand within existing customers.\nBasis of Presentation and Key Components of Our Results of Operations\nIn fiscal year 2021, we managed our business in six segments which include Africa, Americas, Brazil, Europe and the Middle East and Australasia (our regional sales offices ( RSOs\u201d)), and our central services organization ( CSO\u201d). CSO is our central services organization that wholesales our products and services to our RSOs which, in turn, interface with our end-customers, distributors and dealers. CSO is also responsible for the development of our hardware and software platforms and provides common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our other operating segments.\nThe CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the reportable segments, has been identified collectively as the executive committee and the Chief Executive Officer who make strategic decisions. Segment performance is measured and evaluated by the CODM using Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure which uses net income, determined under International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS\u201d) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, as a starting point. Prior to the publication of the financial results for the year ended March 31, 2020, we published results under IFRS only, which is the reason for the CODM using a segment performance measure based on IFRS.\nIn determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the margin generated by CSO, net of any unrealized intercompany profit, is allocated to the geographic region where the external revenue is recorded by our RSOs. The costs remaining in CSO relate mainly to research and development of hardware and software platforms, common marketing, product management and technical and distribution support to each of the RSOs.\nEach RSO's results reflect the external revenue earned, as well as the Segment Adjusted EBITDA earned (or loss incurred) before the remaining CSO and corporate costs allocations. Segment assets are not disclosed as this information is not reviewed by the CODM.\nRevenue\nThe majority of our revenue is subscription-based. Consequently, growth in subscribers influences our subscription revenue growth. However, other factors, including, but not limited to, the types of new subscribers we add and the timing of entry into subscription contracts also play a significant role. The price and terms of our customer subscription contracts vary based on a number of factors, including fleet size, hardware options, geographic region and distribution channel. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which are used to collect, generate and transmit the data used to enable our SaaS solutions.\nOur customer contracts typically have a three to five year initial term. Following the initial term, most fleet customers elect to renew for fixed terms ranging from one to five years. Our third party dealers are typically billed monthly based on active connections. Some of our customer agreements, including our consumer subscriptions, provide for automatic monthly or yearly renewals unless the customer elects not to renew its subscription. Our consumer customer contracts in South Africa are governed by the Consumer Protection Act, which allows customers to cancel without paying the full balance of the contract amount. Our fleet contracts and our customer contracts outside of South Africa are generally non-cancellable.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue associated with our subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to cellular communications, infrastructure hosting, third-party data providers, service contract maintenance costs, commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors (commission is capitalized and amortized unless the amortization period is 12 months or less) and depreciation of our capitalized installed in-vehicle devices. Cost of sales associated with our hardware revenue includes the cost of the in-vehicle devices, cost of hardware warranty, shipping costs, custom duties, and commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors. We capitalize the cost of in-vehicle devices utilized to service customers, for customers selecting our bundled option, and we depreciate these costs from the date of installation over their expected useful lives.\nWe expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period depending on our revenue mix, including the proportion of our revenue attributable to our subscription-based services. The majority of the other components of our cost of revenue are variable and are affected by the number of subscribers, the composition of our subscriber base, and the number of new subscriptions sold in the period.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages to sales and marketing employees, commissions paid to employees, travel-related expenses, and advertising and promotional costs. We pay our sales employees commissions based on achieving subscription targets and we capitalize commission and amortize it (unless the amortization period is 12 months or less). Advertising costs consist primarily of costs for print, radio and television advertising, promotions, public relations, customer events, tradeshows and sponsorships. We expense advertising costs as incurred. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to grow our sales and build brand and category awareness.\nAdministration and Other Charges\nAdministration and other charges consist primarily of salaries and wages for administrative staff, travel costs, professional fees (including audit and legal fees), real estate leasing costs, expensed research and development costs and depreciation of fixed assets including vehicles and office equipment and amortization of intangible assets. We expect that administration and other charges will increase in absolute terms as we continue to grow our business.\nResearch and Development\nFor additional disclosures in respect of research and development, technology and intellectual property please refer to Item 1. Business\u201d.\nTaxes\nIn fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 our effective tax rates were 39.9%, 47.2% and 15.3% respectively, compared to a South African statutory rate of 28%. Taxation mainly consists of normal statutory income tax paid or payable and deferred tax on any temporary differences.\nOur effective tax rate may vary primarily according to the mix of profits made in various jurisdictions and the impact of certain non-deductible/(non-taxable) foreign exchange movements, net of tax. A reconciliation of the actual tax rate to the South African tax rate of 28% is disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. As a result, significant variances in future periods may occur.\nResults of operations\nThe following table sets forth certain Consolidated Statement of Income data:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td>

fiscal year 2021. The principal factors affecting our revenue contraction included:\n\u2022Subscription revenue decreased by 11.1% to $113.4 million, compared to $127.6 million for fiscal year 2020. Subscription revenue represented 89.3% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2021 compared to 87.6% for the prior year. Subscription revenues decreased by 6.1% on a constant currency basis, year over year. The decline in constant currency subscription revenue was primarily due to the contraction in our subscriber base as a result of economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal year 2021, our subscriber base contracted by 73,800 subscribers to 744,700 subscribers at March 31, 2021. We experienced fleet contraction in a number of key verticals such as the oil and gas vertical, consumer vertical and leasing vertical which impacted both our subscriber-count and subscription revenue line, the contraction is mainly attributable to our low ARPU asset tracking subscribers.\nThe majority of our revenues and subscription revenues are derived from currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against these currencies (in particular against the South African Rand) following currency volatility arising from the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, has negatively impacted our revenue and subscription revenues reported in U.S. Dollars. Compared to fiscal year 2020, the South African Rand weakened by 11% against the U.S. Dollar. The Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate averaged R16.37 in fiscal year 2021 compared to an average of R14.78 during fiscal year 2020. The impact of translating foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates during fiscal year 2021 led to a 5.0% reduction in reported U.S. Dollar subscription revenues.\n\u2022Hardware and other revenue decreased by $4.5 million, or 25.1%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 primarily as a result of a global economic slowdown following the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As shown in the table below, hardware and other revenue was lower across all geographical segments.\nThe impact of translating foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates during fiscal year 2021 led to a 4.6% reduction in reported U.S. Dollar revenues.\nA breakdown of third party revenue by segment is shown in the table below:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Subscription Revenue </td> <td>Hardware and other revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Africa </td> <td> </td> <td>$76,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$67,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$70,886 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$62,453 </td> <td> </td> <td>$5,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$5,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td> </td> <td>24,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,211 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East and Australasia </td> <td> </td> <td>23,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,558 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe </td> <td> </td> <td>15,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,138 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazil </td> <td> </td> <td>5,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,922 </td> <td> </td> <td>614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CSO </td> <td> </td> <td>413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td>303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$145,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$126,894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$127,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$113,351 </td> <td> </td> <td>$18,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$13,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the Africa segment, subscription revenue decreased by $8.4 million or 11.9%. On a constant currency basis, the contraction in subscription revenue was 3.4% as a result of a 10.1% decrease in subscribers since April 1, 2020. Hardware and other revenue decreased by $0.4 million or 6.4%. Total revenue decreased by $8.8 million or 11.5%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue contraction was 3.1%.\nIn the Americas segment, subscription revenue declined by $4.1 million or 18.4% as a result of both a 27.7% decrease in subscribers since April 1, 2020 and as a result of economic conditions in the oil and gas vertical. Included in fiscal year 2021 subscription revenue reported above is revenue of $1.1 million pertaining to the reduction of existing subscriber contracts of a significant energy sector customer, following a reduction of their fleet due to current economic conditions. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.4 million or 65.1%. Total revenue declined by $5.5 million or 22.6%.\nSubscription revenue in the Middle East and Australasia segment declined by $0.8 million or 4.8%. On a constant currency basis, the decline in subscription revenue was 7.2%. Subscribers decreased by 1.8% since April 1, 2020. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.1 million or 18.5%. Total revenue declined by $1.9 million or 8.2%. Total revenue in constant currency declined by 10.7%.\nIn the Europe segment, subscription revenue growth was $0.5 million or 3.9%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 0.3%. Subscribers increased by 0.5% since April 1, 2020. Total revenue decreased by $0.4 million or 3.0%, due to a decrease in hardware and other revenues of $0.9 million compared to fiscal year 2020. Total revenue decreased by 6.4% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Brazil segment, subscription revenue declined by $1.3 million or 24.3%. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue decreased by 0.5%. Subscribers increased by 3.9% since April 1, 2020 which was offset by pricing concessions granted to customers as a result of economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hardware and other revenue declined by $0.5 million or 76.9%. Total revenue declined by $1.7 million or 29.9%.

Fiscal 2020 included $2.0 million in-vehicle device accelerated depreciation which resulted in an increased subscription revenue margin in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, hardware and other margins were lower than in fiscal 2021, mainly due to the geographical sales mix and the distribution channels. Hardware sales via our dealer channel attract lower gross margins.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing costs decreased by $2.0 million, or 14.9%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 against a 12.9% decrease in total revenue. The decrease in fiscal year 2021 was primarily as a result of savings of $1.0 million in employee costs, $0.7 million in travel costs and other decreases of $0.3 million, none of which were individually significant.

There was no material movement in ARPUs from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased by 8.7% from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.\n\u2022Hardware and other revenue decreased by $2.5 million, or 12.0%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.\nA breakdown of third party revenue by segment is shown in the table below:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Subscription Revenue </td> <td>Hardware and other revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Africa </td> <td> </td> <td>$75,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$76,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$70,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$70,886 </td> <td> </td> <td>$5,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$5,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td> </td> <td>23,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,322 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East and Australasia </td> <td> </td> <td>23,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,389 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe </td> <td> </td> <td>15,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,682 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazil </td> <td> </td> <td>4,976 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,181 </td> <td> </td> <td>322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CSO </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$143,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$145,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$123,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$127,570 </td> <td> </td> <td>$20,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$18,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the Africa segment, subscription revenue increased by $0.4 million or 0.5%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 7.5% as a result of a 8.6% increase in subscribers since April 1, 2019. Total revenue increased by $0.8 million or 1.0%. Hardware and other revenue increased by $0.4 million or 7.6%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue growth was 8.0%.\nIn the Americas segment subscription revenue growth was $1.0 million or 4.9%. Subscribers increased by 1.5% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue improved by $0.6 million or 2.5%.\nSubscription revenue in the Middle East and Australasia segment increased by $1.0 million or 5.8%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 9.3%. Subscribers increased by 10.5% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue declined by $0.4 million or 1.7%. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.4 million, or 19.0%. Total revenue in constant currency improved by 1.7%.\nIn the Europe segment subscription revenue growth was $1.5 million or 14.3%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 18.0%. Subscribers increased by 10.8% since April 1, 2019 and additional growth is attributable to an increase in high ARPU bundled subscribers. Despite the increase in subscription revenue total revenue declined by $0.2 million or 1.5%, due to $1.7 million lower hardware and other revenues compared to fiscal 2019. Total revenue increased by 1.7% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Brazil segment subscription revenue increased by $0.5 million or 11.3%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 20.9%. The increase was due to an increase in subscribers of 25.9% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue increased by $0.8 million or 16.5%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased by 26.5%.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue - subscription </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue - hardware and other </td> <td>11,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin </td> <td>67.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>63.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin - subscription </td> <td>71.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>68.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin - hardware and other </td> <td>41.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompared to an increase in total revenue of $1.9 million or 1.4%, cost of revenues increased by $6.1 million or 13.1%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. This resulted in a lower gross profit margin of 63.6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to 67.4% in fiscal year 2019.\nDuring fiscal 2020, subscription revenue gross profit margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to accelerated depreciation of in-vehicle devices following contraction in certain fleets in the oil and gas vertical in the Americas segment.\nDuring fiscal 2020, hardware and other margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to the geographical sales mix and the distribution channels. Hardware sales via our dealer channel attract lower gross margins. In addition there is pricing pressure on hardware prices as customers look to reduce the upfront cost of their investment.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing costs decreased by $1.2 million or 8.0%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020 against a 1.4% increase in total revenue. The decrease in fiscal year 2020 was primarily as a result of a $0.5 million decrease in bonuses, a $0.5 million decrease in salaries and wages, a $0.1 million decrease in foreign travel costs and other decreases of $0.1 million, none of which were individually significant. In fiscal year 2020, sales and marketing costs represented 9.1% of revenue compared to 10.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2019.\nAdministration and Other Expenses\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administration and other </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdministration and other expenses increased by $0.2 million or 0.4%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.\nThe increase mainly relates to increases in expected credit loss provision primarily in the South Africa business of $1.9 million mainly, professional fees of $0.9 million, offset by saving in bonuses of $1.3 million primarily due to lower subscription revenue growth being achieved, salaries and wages of $0.8 million and operating lease costs of $0.4 million.\nTaxation\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate </td> <td>39.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>47.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense increased by 0.1%, while our effective tax rate increased by 7.3% to 47.2% in fiscal year 2020. A reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the South African corporate tax rate of 28% for both fiscal years 2020 and 2019, is presented in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2020 the effective tax rate increased by 19.6% as a result of certain non-deductible foreign exchange movements on intercompany loans which have led to deferred tax charges being recognized in the Income Statement. In fiscal 2019 non-deductible foreign exchange differences increased the tax rate by 14.0%.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the last three fiscal years. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset these higher costs through price increases. Our inability to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nWe use certain measures to assess the financial performance of our business. Certain of these measures are termed non-GAAP measures\u201d because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and constant currency information.\nAn explanation of the relevance of each of the non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and a discussion of their limitations is set out below. We do not regard these non-GAAP measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP or those calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are two of the profit measures reviewed by the CODM. We define Adjusted EBITDA as the income before income taxes, net interest income, net foreign exchange gains/(losses), depreciation of property and equipment including capitalized customer in-vehicle devices, amortization of intangible assets including capitalized internal-use software development costs and intangible assets identified as part of a business combination, stock-based compensation costs, restructuring costs and profits/(losses) on the disposal or impairments of assets or subsidiaries. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in this annual report because they are key measures that our management and Board of Directors use to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends; to prepare and approve its annual budget; and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide a useful\nmeasure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company's core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results.\nA reconciliation of net income (the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA for the year is presented below.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income for the year </td> <td>$14,810 </td> <td> </td> <td>$10,987 </td> <td> </td> <td>$14,595 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Income tax expense </td> <td>9,815 </td> <td> </td> <td>9,829 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,634 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Less)/plus: Net interest (income)/expense </td> <td>(233) </td> <td> </td> <td>(67) </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Less)/plus: Foreign exchange (gains)/losses </td> <td>(28) </td> <td> </td> <td>610 </td> <td> </td> <td>959 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Depreciation (1)\n</td> <td>12,492 </td> <td> </td> <td>16,149 </td> <td> </td> <td>12,878 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Amortization (2)\n</td> <td>3,876 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,823 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,681 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Impairment of long-lived assets </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Stock-based compensation costs </td> <td>511 </td> <td> </td> <td>660 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,273 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Less)/plus: Net (profit)/loss on sale of property and equipment </td> <td>(43) </td> <td> </td> <td>(270) </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus/(less): Restructuring costs </td> <td>221 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,055 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$41,483 </td> <td> </td> <td>$41,726 </td> <td> </td> <td>$37,168 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin </td> <td>28.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>29.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes depreciation of owned equipment (including in-vehicle devices).\n(2) Includes amortization of intangible assets (including intangible assets identified as part of a business combination).\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered as performance measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nSome of these limitations are:\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure; and\n\u2022certain of the adjustments (such as restructuring costs, impairment of long-lived assets and others) made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA are those that management believes are not representative of our underlying operations and, therefore, are subjective in nature.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including income from operations, net income and our other results.\nBasic and Diluted non-GAAP Net Income per share\nNon-GAAP net income is defined as net income excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.\nWe have included non-GAAP net income per share in this Annual Report because it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business by excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax and associated tax consequences from earnings. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income for the year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,595 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net foreign exchange (gains)/losses </td> <td>(28) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>959 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax effect of net foreign exchange (gains)/losses </td> <td>3,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,657) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,897 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic ('000) </td> <td>563,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>549,415 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted ('000) </td> <td>583,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>567,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>560,624 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConstant Currency Information\nConstant currency information has been presented in the sections below to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on our results. The constant currency information has been determined by adjusting the current financial reporting year's results to the prior year's average exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates applicable to the year. The measurement has been performed for each of our currencies, including the South African Rand and British Pound. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated by utilizing the constant currency results compared to the prior year results.\nThe constant currency information represents non-GAAP information. We believe this provides a useful basis to measure the performance of our business as it removes distortion from the effects of foreign currency movements during the period.\nDue to the significant portion of our customers who are invoiced in non-U.S. Dollar denominated currencies, we also calculate our subscription revenue growth rate on a constant currency basis, thereby removing the effect of currency fluctuation on our results of operations.\nRefer to discussion below for the annual constant currency growth. The following tables provide the constant currency reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the fiscal years shown:\nSubscription Revenue\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

We expect any repurchases under this share repurchase program to be funded out of existing cash resources. During fiscal year 2021, there were no additional share repurchases. Refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d for information regarding our share repurchase program.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2019 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $47.6 million, a net investment in operating assets and liabilities of $10.6 million, net interest received of $0.7 million and taxes paid of $6.2 million.\nNet cash generated from operating activities decreased from $31.5 million in fiscal year 2019 to $28.2 million in fiscal year 2020 which is primarily attributable to more net income (after excluding non-cash charges) before operating assets and liabilities changes of $4.8 million offset by negative net operating assets and liabilities changes of $8.2 million, lower net interest received of $0.2 million and lower taxation paid of $0.4 million. Net cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2020 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $52.3\nmillion, a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities investments of $18.8 million, net interest received of $0.5 million and taxes paid of $5.8 million.\nNet cash generated from operating activities increased from $28.2 million in fiscal year 2020 to $38.6 million in fiscal year 2021 which is primarily attributable to improved cash generated from operations of $10.5 million offset by lower net interest received of $0.1 million. The improved cash generated from operations is primarily as a result of improved working capital management of $17.9 million (specifically a decrease in accounts receivables of $9.2 million due to improved management of receivables and lower revenues, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $8.6 million, foreign currency translation adjustments of $6.0 million, and lower capitalized commissions of $1.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payables of $5.9 million, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.6 million and an increase in inventories of $0.4 million), offset by lower net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $6.8 million.\nNet cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2021 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $45.6 million, a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities investments of $1.6 million, net interest received of $0.3 million and taxes paid of $5.8 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2019 was $19.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2019 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $19.4 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $4.8 million, which included internal-use software of $3.5 million, as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $1.3 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $14.6 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $13.9 million. Offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $0.2 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2020 increased to $19.4 million from $19.2 million in fiscal year 2019. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2020 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $20.4 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $5.7 million, which included internal-use software of $3.4 million as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $2.3 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $14.7 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $13.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities also included $0.3 million loan advanced to third parties offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $1.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2021 decreased to $8.7 million from $19.4 million in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to lower in-vehicle devices capital expenditure as a result of lower revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2021 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $8.7 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $4.0 million, which included internal-use software of $2.8 million as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $1.2 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $4.6 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $4.2 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal year 2019, the cash used in financing activities of $8.6 million includes share repurchases of $5.3 million, dividends paid of $4.9 million, offset by proceeds from issuance of shares in respect of employee stock options of $1.0 million and $0.7 million from facilities utilized.\nIn fiscal year 2020, the cash used in financing activities of $15.5 million includes share repurchases of $9.8 million, dividends paid of $6.0 million, offset by $0.3 million from facilities utilized.\nIn fiscal year 2021, the cash used in financing activities of $5.2 million includes dividends paid of $5.4 million and $0.7 million from facilities repaid, offset by proceeds of $0.9 million from the issue of ordinary shares in relation to the exercise of stock options.\nCredit Facilities\nAt March 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were net cash balances of $43.8 million (consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $45.5 million less short-term debt (bank overdraft)) of $1.7 million) and unutilized borrowing capacity of $5.5 million available through our credit facilities. Our principal sources of credit are our facilities with Standard Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited.\nWe have an overdraft facility of R64.0 million (equivalent of $4.3 million as of March 31, 2021), an unutilized working capital facility of R25.0 million (equivalent of $1.7 million as of March 31, 2021) and an unutilized vehicle and asset finance facility of R8.5 million (equivalent of $0.6 million as of March 31, 2021) with Standard Bank Limited that bear interest at South African Prime less 1.2% except for the working capital facility that bears interest at South African Prime less 0.25%.\nAt March 31, 2021, $1.7 million was utilized under the overdraft facility. We use this facility as part of our foreign currency hedging strategy. We draw down on this facility in the applicable foreign currency in order to fix the exchange rate on existing balance sheet foreign currency exposure that we anticipate settling in that foreign currency. Our obligations under the overdraft facility with Standard Bank Limited are guaranteed by MiX Telematics Limited and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, MiX Telematics Africa Proprietary Limited and MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited, and secured by a pledge of accounts receivable by MiX Telematics Limited and MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we entered into a R25.0 million (equivalent of $1.7 million as of March 31, 2021) working capital facility with Standard Bank Limited that bears interest at South African Prime less 0.25%. As of March 31, 2021, the facility was undrawn. We use this facility for working capital purposes in our Africa operations.\nDuring fiscal year 2014, we entered into a R10.0 million (equivalent of $0.7 million as of March 31, 2021) facility with Nedbank Limited that bears interest at South African Prime less 2%. As of March 31, 2021, the facility was undrawn. We use this facility for working capital purposes in our Africa operations.\nOur credit facilities with Standard Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited contain certain restrictive clauses, including without limitation, those limiting our and our guarantor subsidiaries', as applicable, ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, or sell or acquire assets or businesses. These facilities are not subject to any financial covenants such as interest coverage or gearing ratios.\nContractual and other obligations\nThe following table sets forth our future annual repayment of debt, and our contractual commitments as of March 31, 2021 (U.S. Dollar amounts were translated from South African Rand at the exchange rate of R14.9167 per $1.00, which is the exchange rate as of March 31, 2021):\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal 2022 </td> <td>Fiscal 2023 </td> <td>Fiscal 2024 </td> <td>Fiscal 2025 </td> <td>Fiscal 2026 </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease liabilities (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,473 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,171 </td> <td> </td> <td>998 </td> <td> </td> <td>938 </td> <td> </td> <td>912 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,731 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,223 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,674 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,674 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Approved, and contracted, capital commitments (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-property and equipment\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,234 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,234 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-intangible assets\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,321 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,321 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,398 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,644 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,009 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,183 </td> <td> </td> <td>535 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,769 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,100 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,815 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,007 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,121 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,447 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,731 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,221 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Refer to Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on leases.\n(2) Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on short-term debt (bank overdraft).\n(3) Refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on capital commitments.\n(4) Outstanding purchase obligations primarily represent agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and includes amounts relating to production of our products, information technology services and employee benefit administration services.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates are summarized below. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the amortization period for deferred commissions, allowances for doubtful accounts, the assessment of expected cash flows used in evaluating goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, the determination of useful lives of our customer relationships, contingencies, the classification of devices and other hardware as in-vehicle devices (equipment) versus inventory based on the future expectation of the different types of customer contracts, income and deferred taxes, and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Our actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of distinct promised products and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and/or services. We enter into contracts that include the supply of fleet and mobile asset management equipment. For such contracts, we utilize significant judgment to determine whether control of the equipment has transferred to the customer, and in instances where it does, we recognize revenue in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). When control of the equipment does not transfer to the customer, which is when legal title does not transfer to the customer, our judgement is that the customer does not have the right to direct the use of the equipment when the customer does not operate the equipment or make any significant decisions about its use. In these instances we use the equipment to provide fleet and mobile asset management services to the customer. Accordingly, these arrangements, which comprise virtually all of the transactions in which legal title does not pass to the customer, are not within the scope of ASC 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d). Instead, for such contracts we have concluded that they are service contracts comprising a single performance obligation, and revenue is recognized over time pursuant to ASC 606.\nRecognition and measurement\nWe provide fleet and mobile asset management solutions to our customers, and our principal revenue streams are (1) Subscription and (2) Hardware and other. Subscription revenue is recognized over time and hardware and other revenue is recognized at a point-in-time.\nTo provide services to customers, a device is required which collects and transmits information collected from the vehicle or other asset. Fleet customers may also obtain other items of hardware, virtually all of which are functionally-dependent on the device. Some customers obtain control of the device and other hardware (where legal title transfers to the customer); while other customers do not (where legal title remains with the Company). A contract arises on the acceptance of a customer's purchase order, which is typically executed in writing.\nWe distribute devices and other hardware to certain small fleet operators and consumers through distributors. Distributors act as agents and hardware revenue is only recognized when the distributor sells the hardware unit to the end customer. Once a unit is sold to a customer, the customer enters into a service agreement directly with us. The obligation to supply the service and the credit risk rests with us. The subscription revenue is recognized when the service is rendered.\nWe also sell hardware to motor vehicle dealerships for fitment into their vehicle trading stock. These dealerships purchase the hardware from us and are considered to act as a principal in the contract because they obtain title to the hardware, bear the risks and rewards of ownership and accordingly control the hardware purchased. The buyer of the vehicle then enters into a service-only contract with us. Revenue is recognized upon sale of the hardware to the dealership and subscription revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer.\nWe distribute devices and other hardware to enterprise fleet customers through dealers. Dealers are considered to act as a principal for the sale of hardware to the end customer, and revenue is recognized by us upon sale of the hardware unit to the dealer. Dealers are also considered to act as a principal for the provision of the service to end customers because, even though the dealers do not provide the service themselves, the dealers control the right to receive the service before that right is transferred to the end customer, the dealers have the primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide the service to the end customer, and the dealers have full discretion in establishing the prices charged to the end customer. Accordingly, subscription revenue is recognized as the service is provided to the dealers.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivables is calculated by considering all relevant information, internal and external about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to appropriately reflect the risk of losses over the remaining contractual lives of the assets. Historical loss rates, calculated as actual losses over a period as a percentage of revenue, are adjusted for current conditions and management's expectations about future economic conditions.\nThe allowance is measured on a collective basis where management groups their customers appropriately based on their credit risk characteristics.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account and the asset's carrying amount is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Actual write-downs are recorded when the asset is deemed uncollectible after all efforts to recover have yielded no results.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for possible impairment at least annually, or when circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill is allocated to a reporting unit for the purpose of impairment testing. The carrying value of the reporting unit, to which goodwill has been allocated, is compared to its fair value, and a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount (if any) by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value, limited to the amount of the goodwill. No impairments of goodwill existed as of the last testing date, March 31, 2021 or the previous testing, March 31, 2020. The changes in the carrying value of goodwill during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 are attributable only to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nAlthough there were no impairments of goodwill as of March 31, 2020 and 2021, significant judgement was exercised in determining the fair value of each reporting unit, in particular judgements regarding the discount rate used (weighted average cost of capital rate), the expected future cash flows and terminal growth rates. Especially in light of COVID-19, which has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. In particular, to the extent that anticipated new contracts do not materialize and the business strategy does not come to fruition, or key personnel are not retained, the forecasts on which the impairment tests were performed could be negatively impacted.\nTaxation\nWe are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. During the process of determining our world-wide provision for income taxes, we are required to make judgements in respect of international tax matters, including transfer pricing and controlled foreign company legislation. Where applicable tax legislation is subject to interpretation, management makes assessments, based on expert tax advice, of the relevant tax that is more likely than not to be paid and provides accordingly.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Income tax expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. We use the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws and tax rates enacted by the reporting date in the countries where we operate and generate taxable income. Interest, and penalties, incurred on the underpayment of income taxes is classified as interest expense, and administration expenses, respectively.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax is measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax balances and associated valuation allowances represent management's best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimate.\nDeferred tax liabilities arising on investments in domestic subsidiaries are not recognized to the extent that the investment can be recovered on a tax-free basis; and on investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the undistributed earnings will be invested indefinitely or will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not engage in any off-balance sheet financing activities. We do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities, which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities which are not consolidated.", "summary":

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our future results may vary materially from those indicated as a result of the risks that affect our business, including, among others, those identified in Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global provider of connected fleet and mobile asset solutions delivered as Software as a Service ( SaaS\u201d). Our solutions deliver a measurable return by enabling our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in commercial fleets or personal vehicles. We generate actionable insights that enable a wide range of customers, from large enterprise fleets to small fleet operators and consumers, to reduce fuel and other operating costs, improve efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, enhance driver safety, manage risk and mitigate theft. Our solutions mostly rely on our proprietary, highly scalable technology platforms, which allow us to collect, analyze and deliver information based on data from our customers' vehicles. Using an intuitive, web-based interface, dashboards or mobile apps, our fleet customers can access large volumes of real-time and historical data, monitor the location and status of their drivers and vehicles and analyze a wide number of key metrics across their fleet operations.\nWe were founded in 1996 and we have offices in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uganda, Brazil, Australia, Romania, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates as well as a network of more than 130 fleet partners worldwide. MiX Telematics shares are publicly traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE: MIX) and MiX Telematics American Depositary Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: MIXT).\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from subscriptions to our fleet and mobile asset management solutions. Our subscriptions generally include access to our SaaS solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, use of an in-vehicle device. We also generate revenues from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which enable customers to use our subscription-based solutions, installation services of our in-vehicle-devices and driver training for fleet customers. We generate sales through the efforts of our direct sales teams, staffed in our regional sales offices, and through our global network of distributors and dealers. Our direct sales teams focus on marketing our fleet solutions to global and multinational enterprise accounts and to other large customer accounts located in regions of the world where we maintain a direct sales presence. Our direct sales teams have industry expertise across multiple industries, including oil and gas, transportation and logistics, government and municipal, bus and coach, rental and leasing, and utilities. In some markets, we rely on a network of distributors and dealers to sell our solutions on our behalf. Our distributors and dealers also install our in-vehicle devices and provide training, technical support and ongoing maintenance for the customers they support.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in China ( COVID-19\u201d). In January 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of international concern and, subsequently, it was declared a pandemic in March 2020. The outbreak continued to spread globally, affecting global economic activity and financial markets. We have considered the impact of COVID-19 including its impact on expected credit losses and potential goodwill impairments, however numerous uncertainties remain, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact on our customers and other factors identified in Item 1A. Risk Factors - The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nBusiness, employees and operations\nDue to extensive measures implemented by various governments, all of our employees were required to work remotely, with the exception of our staff working in our monitoring centers, which were classified as an essential service. We have implemented appropriate safeguards for these centers. In addition, we have modified certain business and\nworkforce practices (including extended work from home requirements, suspension of certain business travel and cancellation of certain physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and implemented new protocols to promote social distancing and enhance sanitary measures in our offices and facilities to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we implemented various cost-saving measures, including headcount reductions, deferred salary increases, a hiring freeze across the business, and significant reductions in discretionary spending. We started to realize the benefit of these actions in the second quarter. As part of the headcount reductions in fiscal 2021, we incurred a $1.1 million restructuring charge as we committed to plans to restructure certain parts of our business as a measure to minimize the adverse economic and business effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and to re-align resources to our current business outlook and cost structure. The restructuring activities mainly related to the CSO, Africa Middle East and Australasia and North America reporting segments.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted the operations of our customers and channel partners, our operations and the results of our operations. COVID-19 currently has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. For example, the continued economic uncertainty in the oil and gas sector has resulted in significant declines in our customer's fleet sizes whilst similar disruption is evident in our bus and coach vertical following significantly reduced demand for public transport as a result of various governmental shut downs in multiple jurisdictions where we operate. This has and will continue to have a negative impact on our revenue and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. During fiscal year 2021, we experienced a contraction of 73,800 subscribers as a result of the economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The net contraction in subscribers resulted in a decrease in reported subscription revenues.\nCash resources and liquidity\nBased on our internal projections we believe that we have sufficient cash reserves to support us for the foreseeable future. Further details on our cash resources and borrowings available under our credit facilities are provided in the liquidity and capital resources section below.\nFinancial position and impairments\nWe have taken into account the impact of COVID-19, to the extent possible, on our financial statements as of reporting date. However, future changes in economic conditions related to COVID-19 could have an impact on future estimates and judgements used, particularly those relating to Goodwill sensitivities and impairment assessments, as well as expected credit losses. Refer to note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Goodwill sensitivities. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.\nKey Financial Measures and Operating Metrics\nIn addition to financial measures based on our consolidated financial statements, we monitor our business operations using various financial and non-financial metrics.\nSubscription Revenue\nSubscription revenue represents subscription fees for our solutions, which include the use of our SaaS fleet management solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, our in-vehicle devices. Our subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of subscribers and the monthly price per subscriber, which varies depending on the services and features customers require, hardware options, customer size and geographic location.\nSubscription revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue due to a reduction in hardware and other revenue. In fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, subscription revenue represented 85.7%, 87.6% and 89.3% respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, our top 10 customers represented 24.9%, 23.7% and 21.8% respectively, of our subscription revenue.\nSubscribers\nSubscribers represent the total number of discrete services we provide to customers at the end of the period.\n\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nLevel of Subscription Revenue and Hardware Revenue\nWe have historically been focused on growing our recurring subscription revenue base and entering into more fully bundled deals. As a result of an increase in the total subscriber base, and due to new and existing subscribers moving to fully-bundled subscriptions, subscription revenue has increased as a percentage of revenue. In fiscal year 2021, subscription-based revenues accounted for 89.3% of our total revenues, up from 87.6% in 2020 and 85.7% in 2019. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the level of business disruption as a result of the spread of COVID-19, the Company suspended its practice of issuing financial guidance during fiscal 2021 and has also not provided guidance for fiscal 2022.\nAs market conditions improve globally, we believe that we will be well positioned to grow our base of subscribers, by adding both fully-bundled subscriptions; subscriptions where the hardware has been purchased upfront and various add-on solutions that can drive incremental average revenue per user ( ARPU\u201d) expansion over time. We intend to maintain our investment in sales and marketing and continue to attract new subscribers by introducing attractive new features and services.\nAdditionally, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our fleet management market share among our existing customer base by demonstrating our value proposition, growing with the customer, introducing new and innovative value-added solutions and displacing legacy fleet management solutions.\nFluctuations in Exchange Rates\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented a substantial portion of our total revenue. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, will negatively affect our reported income and expenses as expressed in U.S. Dollars (our reporting currency). The South African Rand is the functional currency for the Company. Currency fluctuations in the South African Rand may positively or negatively impact our reported income and expenses due to the effects of translating the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries into Rand at different average exchange rates and then translating into our reporting currency of U.S. Dollars.\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Rand weakened by 10.8% against the U.S. Dollar and by 13.7% against the British Pound, as shown in the table below.\n\nWe expect continued exchange rate volatility in the South African Rand against other major currencies. The South African Rand has been even more volatile due to the uncertain economic conditions including the effect of COVID-19 and it is uncertain how long this will continue. As of June 10, 2021, the South African Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 13.65, 16.6% stronger than the average exchange rate for fiscal 2021.\nMix of Subscribers with Different Revenue and Cost Economics\nWe offer services to a wide range of customers, from large enterprise vehicle fleets to small fleet operators and consumers. The subscription revenue and cost per subscriber and the subscriber retention pattern differ by type of subscriber. For example, our entry-level consumer solution, Beam-e, is characterized by lower revenue and lower cost per subscriber compared to our large enterprise solutions. Small fleet and consumer customers will enter into and terminate contracts much more frequently than our enterprise customers, thereby affecting subscriber retention. As the mix of our subscriber base evolves, the average revenue per subscriber and average cost per subscriber is likely to change.\nVarying Economic Conditions in our Markets\nWe seek to capitalize on opportunities and manage risks in our key markets, which are geographically dispersed with subscribers located in more than 120 countries worldwide. Overall, we believe that our presence across multiple geographic markets and our exposure to multiple economies provides us with diversification from the risk of changing economic conditions in any one country or region. Other macroeconomic factors, such as expectations for future crude oil and natural gas prices, affect our customers' spending habits. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices, or the perception that such prices will decrease in the future, negatively impacts our net subscriber growth and hardware sales in this sector. In addition to macroeconomic changes, performance in any given region may vary due to multiple factors, including growth in subscribers, the overall profile of the customer base (for example, in Africa, we have a significant consumer subscriber base), the services and hardware options selected by particular subscribers and our distribution strategy in the region.\nChanges in regional conditions require management to formulate strategic responses that safeguard our financial position and maintain our balanced approach to producing revenue growth, profitability and cash flow.\nChanging Customer Needs and Ongoing Investment in Technology\nWe continuously analyze market trends and opportunities in the various geographies in which we operate and have identified an opportunity to increase subscription revenue growth by the addition of new products and services in certain of the regions in which we operate. Our investment in software development is core to our business strategy. Our software teams employ an agile software development methodology. We have made a significant investment in product development, and we have routinely been among the first to market with innovative solutions and features that cater to the needs of our customers. For example, major updates to the MiX Vision solution were made in fiscal year 2021, with MiX Vision AI poised for launch in calendar year 2021.\nLong Sales Cycle for Our Enterprise Fleet Management Solutions\nFrom period to period, our revenues may fluctuate depending upon the customer contracts we have secured. The typical sales cycle for large enterprise fleet management solutions contracts may be long, especially in comparison to the sales cycle for our consumer solutions. It may also be difficult for us to predict the timing of when we will enter into enterprise fleet management contracts.\nLonger sales cycles for large contracts, for both customers who purchase in-vehicle devices and those who opt for the fully bundled option, may affect the comparability of financial results in certain segments. Our revenue may fluctuate from period to period depending on the level and timing of hardware sales, while subscription revenue growth is also impacted by the timing of the rollout of large enterprise fleets. We are focused on mitigating these long sales cycles and the associated volatility by enhancing our sales pipeline management process, by increasing our sales and marketing investment levels across all geographical segments and by diversifying our customer segment focus.\nInvestment in Sales and Marketing\nWe offer our solutions in over 120 countries through a combination of our direct and indirect marketing efforts. Our sales and marketing strategy is segmented by geographic region and customer type in order to cost effectively target and acquire new customers. In certain regions, we sell subscriptions of our fleet management solutions to large enterprise fleets through our direct sales force. In other regions, and for sales to small fleet operators and consumers, we work with an extensive distribution network of regional partners and national distribution dealers. Through our central services organization headquartered in South Africa, we provide optimized marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our regional sales and marketing operations. We continue to focus on growth and expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base and to expand within existing customers.\nBasis of Presentation and Key Components of Our Results of Operations\nIn fiscal year 2021, we managed our business in six segments which include Africa, Americas, Brazil, Europe and the Middle East and Australasia (our regional sales offices ( RSOs\u201d)), and our central services organization ( CSO\u201d). CSO is our central services organization that wholesales our products and services to our RSOs which, in turn, interface with our end-customers, distributors and dealers. CSO is also responsible for the development of our hardware and software platforms and provides common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our other operating segments.\nThe CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the reportable segments, has been identified collectively as the executive committee and the Chief Executive Officer who make strategic decisions. Segment performance is measured and evaluated by the CODM using Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure which uses net income, determined under International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS\u201d) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, as a starting point. Prior to the publication of the financial results for the year ended March 31, 2020, we published results under IFRS only, which is the reason for the CODM using a segment performance measure based on IFRS.\nIn determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the margin generated by CSO, net of any unrealized intercompany profit, is allocated to the geographic region where the external revenue is recorded by our RSOs. The costs remaining in CSO relate mainly to research and development of hardware and software platforms, common marketing, product management and technical and distribution support to each of the RSOs.\nEach RSO's results reflect the external revenue earned, as well as the Segment Adjusted EBITDA earned (or loss incurred) before the remaining CSO and corporate costs allocations. Segment assets are not disclosed as this information is not reviewed by the CODM.\nRevenue\nThe majority of our revenue is subscription-based. Consequently, growth in subscribers influences our subscription revenue growth. However, other factors, including, but not limited to, the types of new subscribers we add and the timing of entry into subscription contracts also play a significant role. The price and terms of our customer subscription contracts vary based on a number of factors, including fleet size, hardware options, geographic region and distribution channel. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which are used to collect, generate and transmit the data used to enable our SaaS solutions.\nOur customer contracts typically have a three to five year initial term. Following the initial term, most fleet customers elect to renew for fixed terms ranging from one to five years. Our third party dealers are typically billed monthly based on active connections. Some of our customer agreements, including our consumer subscriptions, provide for automatic monthly or yearly renewals unless the customer elects not to renew its subscription. Our consumer customer contracts in South Africa are governed by the Consumer Protection Act, which allows customers to cancel without paying the full balance of the contract amount. Our fleet contracts and our customer contracts outside of South Africa are generally non-cancellable.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue associated with our subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to cellular communications, infrastructure hosting, third-party data providers, service contract maintenance costs, commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors (commission is capitalized and amortized unless the amortization period is 12 months or less) and depreciation of our capitalized installed in-vehicle devices. Cost of sales associated with our hardware revenue includes the cost of the in-vehicle devices, cost of hardware warranty, shipping costs, custom duties, and commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors. We capitalize the cost of in-vehicle devices utilized to service customers, for customers selecting our bundled option, and we depreciate these costs from the date of installation over their expected useful lives.\nWe expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period depending on our revenue mix, including the proportion of our revenue attributable to our subscription-based services. The majority of the other components of our cost of revenue are variable and are affected by the number of subscribers, the composition of our subscriber base, and the number of new subscriptions sold in the period.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages to sales and marketing employees, commissions paid to employees, travel-related expenses, and advertising and promotional costs. We pay our sales employees commissions based on achieving subscription targets and we capitalize commission and amortize it (unless the amortization period is 12 months or less). Advertising costs consist primarily of costs for print, radio and television advertising, promotions, public relations, customer events, tradeshows and sponsorships. We expense advertising costs as incurred. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to grow our sales and build brand and category awareness.\nAdministration and Other Charges\nAdministration and other charges consist primarily of salaries and wages for administrative staff, travel costs, professional fees (including audit and legal fees), real estate leasing costs, expensed research and development costs and depreciation of fixed assets including vehicles and office equipment and amortization of intangible assets. We expect that administration and other charges will increase in absolute terms as we continue to grow our business.\nResearch and Development\nFor additional disclosures in respect of research and development, technology and intellectual property please refer to Item 1. Business\u201d.\nTaxes\nIn fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 our effective tax rates were 39.9%, 47.2% and 15.3% respectively, compared to a South African statutory rate of 28%. Taxation mainly consists of normal statutory income tax paid or payable and deferred tax on any temporary differences.\nOur effective tax rate may vary primarily according to the mix of profits made in various jurisdictions and the impact of certain non-deductible/(non-taxable) foreign exchange movements, net of tax. A reconciliation of the actual tax rate to the South African tax rate of 28% is disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. As a result, significant variances in future periods may occur.\nResults of operations\nThe following table sets forth certain Consolidated Statement of Income data:\n\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021\nRevenue\n\nOur total revenue decreased by $18.8 million or 12.9%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021. The principal factors affecting our revenue contraction included:\n\u2022Subscription revenue decreased by 11.1% to $113.4 million, compared to $127.6 million for fiscal year 2020. Subscription revenue represented 89.3% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2021 compared to 87.6% for the prior year. Subscription revenues decreased by 6.1% on a constant currency basis, year over year. The decline in constant currency subscription revenue was primarily due to the contraction in our subscriber base as a result of economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal year 2021, our subscriber base contracted by 73,800 subscribers to 744,700 subscribers at March 31, 2021. We experienced fleet contraction in a number of key verticals such as the oil and gas vertical, consumer vertical and leasing vertical which impacted both our subscriber-count and subscription revenue line, the contraction is mainly attributable to our low ARPU asset tracking subscribers.\nThe majority of our revenues and subscription revenues are derived from currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against these currencies (in particular against the South African Rand) following currency volatility arising from the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, has negatively impacted our revenue and subscription revenues reported in U.S. Dollars. Compared to fiscal year 2020, the South African Rand weakened by 11% against the U.S. Dollar. The Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate averaged R16.37 in fiscal year 2021 compared to an average of R14.78 during fiscal year 2020. The impact of translating foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates during fiscal year 2021 led to a 5.0% reduction in reported U.S. Dollar subscription revenues.\n\u2022Hardware and other revenue decreased by $4.5 million, or 25.1%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 primarily as a result of a global economic slowdown following the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As shown in the table below, hardware and other revenue was lower across all geographical segments.\nThe impact of translating foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates during fiscal year 2021 led to a 4.6% reduction in reported U.S. Dollar revenues.\nA breakdown of third party revenue by segment is shown in the table below:\n\nIn the Africa segment, subscription revenue decreased by $8.4 million or 11.9%. On a constant currency basis, the contraction in subscription revenue was 3.4% as a result of a 10.1% decrease in subscribers since April 1, 2020. Hardware and other revenue decreased by $0.4 million or 6.4%. Total revenue decreased by $8.8 million or 11.5%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue contraction was 3.1%.\nIn the Americas segment, subscription revenue declined by $4.1 million or 18.4% as a result of both a 27.7% decrease in subscribers since April 1, 2020 and as a result of economic conditions in the oil and gas vertical. Included in fiscal year 2021 subscription revenue reported above is revenue of $1.1 million pertaining to the reduction of existing subscriber contracts of a significant energy sector customer, following a reduction of their fleet due to current economic conditions. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.4 million or 65.1%. Total revenue declined by $5.5 million or 22.6%.\nSubscription revenue in the Middle East and Australasia segment declined by $0.8 million or 4.8%. On a constant currency basis, the decline in subscription revenue was 7.2%. Subscribers decreased by 1.8% since April 1, 2020. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.1 million or 18.5%. Total revenue declined by $1.9 million or 8.2%. Total revenue in constant currency declined by 10.7%.\nIn the Europe segment, subscription revenue growth was $0.5 million or 3.9%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 0.3%. Subscribers increased by 0.5% since April 1, 2020. Total revenue decreased by $0.4 million or 3.0%, due to a decrease in hardware and other revenues of $0.9 million compared to fiscal year 2020. Total revenue decreased by 6.4% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Brazil segment, subscription revenue declined by $1.3 million or 24.3%. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue decreased by 0.5%. Subscribers increased by 3.9% since April 1, 2020 which was offset by pricing concessions granted to customers as a result of economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hardware and other revenue declined by $0.5 million or 76.9%. Total revenue declined by $1.7 million or 29.9%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue decreased by 7.8%.\nCost of Revenue\n\nCompared to a decrease in total revenue of $18.8 million or 12.9%, cost of revenues decreased by $9.2 million or 17.3%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021.\nSubscription revenue, which generates a higher gross profit margin than hardware and other revenue, contributed 89.3% of total revenue in fiscal year 2021 compared to 87.6% in fiscal year 2020. Fiscal 2020 included $2.0 million in-vehicle device accelerated depreciation which resulted in an increased subscription revenue margin in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, hardware and other margins were lower than in fiscal 2021, mainly due to the geographical sales mix and the distribution channels. Hardware sales via our dealer channel attract lower gross margins.\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing costs decreased by $2.0 million, or 14.9%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 against a 12.9% decrease in total revenue. The decrease in fiscal year 2021 was primarily as a result of savings of $1.0 million in employee costs, $0.7 million in travel costs and other decreases of $0.3 million, none of which were individually significant. In fiscal year 2021, sales and marketing costs represented 8.9% of revenue compared to 9.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2020.\nAdministration and Other Expenses\n\nAdministration and other expenses decreased by $4.8 million, or 8.2%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021.\nThe decrease mainly relates to savings of $4.1 million in salaries and wages, travel costs of $0.8 million and decreases in expected credit loss provision of $1.0 million, offset by restructuring costs of $1.1 million.\nTaxation\n\nIncome tax expense decreased by 73.2%. Our effective tax rate decreased by 31.9% to 15.3% in fiscal year 2021. A reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the South African corporate tax rate of 28% for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020, is presented in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2021 the effective tax rate decreased by 19.7% as a result of certain non-taxable foreign exchange movements on intercompany loans which have led to deferred tax charges being recognized in the Income Statement. In fiscal 2020 non-deductible foreign exchange differences increased the tax rate by 19.6%.\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nRevenue\n\nOur total revenue increased by $1.9 million or 1.4%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased by 6.3% from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. The principal factors affecting our revenue growth included:\n\u2022Subscription revenue grew by $4.4 million, or 3.6% from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. Subscription revenue represented 87.6% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 compared to 85.7% for the prior year. Our growth in subscription revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in subscribers, which increased by 9.1% from 750,455 at March 31, 2019, to 818,487 at March 31, 2020. There was no material movement in ARPUs from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased by 8.7% from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.\n\u2022Hardware and other revenue decreased by $2.5 million, or 12.0%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.\nA breakdown of third party revenue by segment is shown in the table below:\n\nIn the Africa segment, subscription revenue increased by $0.4 million or 0.5%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 7.5% as a result of a 8.6% increase in subscribers since April 1, 2019. Total revenue increased by $0.8 million or 1.0%. Hardware and other revenue increased by $0.4 million or 7.6%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue growth was 8.0%.\nIn the Americas segment subscription revenue growth was $1.0 million or 4.9%. Subscribers increased by 1.5% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue improved by $0.6 million or 2.5%.\nSubscription revenue in the Middle East and Australasia segment increased by $1.0 million or 5.8%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 9.3%. Subscribers increased by 10.5% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue declined by $0.4 million or 1.7%. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.4 million, or 19.0%. Total revenue in constant currency improved by 1.7%.\nIn the Europe segment subscription revenue growth was $1.5 million or 14.3%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 18.0%. Subscribers increased by 10.8% since April 1, 2019 and additional growth is attributable to an increase in high ARPU bundled subscribers. Despite the increase in subscription revenue total revenue declined by $0.2 million or 1.5%, due to $1.7 million lower hardware and other revenues compared to fiscal 2019. Total revenue increased by 1.7% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Brazil segment subscription revenue increased by $0.5 million or 11.3%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 20.9%. The increase was due to an increase in subscribers of 25.9% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue increased by $0.8 million or 16.5%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased by 26.5%.\nCost of Revenue\n\nCompared to an increase in total revenue of $1.9 million or 1.4%, cost of revenues increased by $6.1 million or 13.1%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. This resulted in a lower gross profit margin of 63.6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to 67.4% in fiscal year 2019.\nDuring fiscal 2020, subscription revenue gross profit margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to accelerated depreciation of in-vehicle devices following contraction in certain fleets in the oil and gas vertical in the Americas segment.\nDuring fiscal 2020, hardware and other margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to the geographical sales mix and the distribution channels. Hardware sales via our dealer channel attract lower gross margins. In addition there is pricing pressure on hardware prices as customers look to reduce the upfront cost of their investment.\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing costs decreased by $1.2 million or 8.0%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020 against a 1.4% increase in total revenue. The decrease in fiscal year 2020 was primarily as a result of a $0.5 million decrease in bonuses, a $0.5 million decrease in salaries and wages, a $0.1 million decrease in foreign travel costs and other decreases of $0.1 million, none of which were individually significant. In fiscal year 2020, sales and marketing costs represented 9.1% of revenue compared to 10.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2019.\nAdministration and Other Expenses\n\nAdministration and other expenses increased by $0.2 million or 0.4%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.\nThe increase mainly relates to increases in expected credit loss provision primarily in the South Africa business of $1.9 million mainly, professional fees of $0.9 million, offset by saving in bonuses of $1.3 million primarily due to lower subscription revenue growth being achieved, salaries and wages of $0.8 million and operating lease costs of $0.4 million.\nTaxation\n\nIncome tax expense increased by 0.1%, while our effective tax rate increased by 7.3% to 47.2% in fiscal year 2020. A reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the South African corporate tax rate of 28% for both fiscal years 2020 and 2019, is presented in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2020 the effective tax rate increased by 19.6% as a result of certain non-deductible foreign exchange movements on intercompany loans which have led to deferred tax charges being recognized in the Income Statement. In fiscal 2019 non-deductible foreign exchange differences increased the tax rate by 14.0%.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the last three fiscal years. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset these higher costs through price increases. Our inability to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nWe use certain measures to assess the financial performance of our business. Certain of these measures are termed non-GAAP measures\u201d because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and constant currency information.\nAn explanation of the relevance of each of the non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and a discussion of their limitations is set out below. We do not regard these non-GAAP measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our future results may vary materially from those indicated as a result of the risks that affect our business, including, among others, those identified in Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global provider of connected fleet and mobile asset solutions delivered as Software as a Service ( SaaS\u201d). Our solutions deliver a measurable return by enabling our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in commercial fleets or personal vehicles. We generate actionable insights that enable a wide range of customers, from large enterprise fleets to small fleet operators and consumers, to reduce fuel and other operating costs, improve efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, enhance driver safety, manage risk and mitigate theft. Our solutions mostly rely on our proprietary, highly scalable technology platforms, which allow us to collect, analyze and deliver information based on data from our customers' vehicles. Using an intuitive, web-based interface, dashboards or mobile apps, our fleet customers can access large volumes of real-time and historical data, monitor the location and status of their drivers and vehicles and analyze a wide number of key metrics across their fleet operations.\nWe were founded in 1996 and we have offices in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uganda, Brazil, Australia, Romania, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates as well as a network of more than 130 fleet partners worldwide. MiX Telematics shares are publicly traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE: MIX) and MiX Telematics American Depositary Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: MIXT).\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from subscriptions to our fleet and mobile asset management solutions. Our subscriptions generally include access to our SaaS solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, use of an in-vehicle device. We also generate revenues from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which enable customers to use our subscription-based solutions, installation services of our in-vehicle-devices and driver training for fleet customers. We generate sales through the efforts of our direct sales teams, staffed in our regional sales offices, and through our global network of distributors and dealers. Our direct sales teams focus on marketing our fleet solutions to global and multinational enterprise accounts and to other large customer accounts located in regions of the world where we maintain a direct sales presence. Our direct sales teams have industry expertise across multiple industries, including oil and gas, transportation and logistics, government and municipal, bus and coach, rental and leasing, and utilities. In some markets, we rely on a network of distributors and dealers to sell our solutions on our behalf. Our distributors and dealers also install our in-vehicle devices and provide training, technical support and ongoing maintenance for the customers they support.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in China ( COVID-19\u201d). In January 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of international concern and, subsequently, it was declared a pandemic in March 2020. The outbreak continued to spread globally, affecting global economic activity and financial markets. We have considered the impact of COVID-19 including its impact on expected credit losses and potential goodwill impairments, however numerous uncertainties remain, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact on our customers and other factors identified in Item 1A. Risk Factors - The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nBusiness, employees and operations\nDue to extensive measures implemented by various governments, all of our employees were required to work remotely, with the exception of our staff working in our monitoring centers, which were classified as an essential service. We have implemented appropriate safeguards for these centers. In addition, we have modified certain business and\nworkforce practices (including extended work from home requirements, suspension of certain business travel and cancellation of certain physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and implemented new protocols to promote social distancing and enhance sanitary measures in our offices and facilities to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we implemented various cost-saving measures, including headcount reductions, deferred salary increases, a hiring freeze across the business, and significant reductions in discretionary spending. We started to realize the benefit of these actions in the second quarter. As part of the headcount reductions in fiscal 2021, we incurred a $1.1 million restructuring charge as we committed to plans to restructure certain parts of our business as a measure to minimize the adverse economic and business effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and to re-align resources to our current business outlook and cost structure. The restructuring activities mainly related to the CSO, Africa Middle East and Australasia and North America reporting segments.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted the operations of our customers and channel partners, our operations and the results of our operations. COVID-19 currently has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. For example, the continued economic uncertainty in the oil and gas sector has resulted in significant declines in our customer's fleet sizes whilst similar disruption is evident in our bus and coach vertical following significantly reduced demand for public transport as a result of various governmental shut downs in multiple jurisdictions where we operate. This has and will continue to have a negative impact on our revenue and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. During fiscal year 2021, we experienced a contraction of 73,800 subscribers as a result of the economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The net contraction in subscribers resulted in a decrease in reported subscription revenues.\nCash resources and liquidity\nBased on our internal projections we believe that we have sufficient cash reserves to support us for the foreseeable future. Further details on our cash resources and borrowings available under our credit facilities are provided in the liquidity and capital resources section below.\nFinancial position and impairments\nWe have taken into account the impact of COVID-19, to the extent possible, on our financial statements as of reporting date. However, future changes in economic conditions related to COVID-19 could have an impact on future estimates and judgements used, particularly those relating to Goodwill sensitivities and impairment assessments, as well as expected credit losses. Refer to note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Goodwill sensitivities. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.\nKey Financial Measures and Operating Metrics\nIn addition to financial measures based on our consolidated financial statements, we monitor our business operations using various financial and non-financial metrics.\nSubscription Revenue\nSubscription revenue represents subscription fees for our solutions, which include the use of our SaaS fleet management solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, our in-vehicle devices. Our subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of subscribers and the monthly price per subscriber, which varies depending on the services and features customers require, hardware options, customer size and geographic location.\nSubscription revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue due to a reduction in hardware and other revenue. In fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, subscription revenue represented 85.7%, 87.6% and 89.3% respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, our top 10 customers represented 24.9%, 23.7% and 21.8% respectively, of our subscription revenue.\nSubscribers\nSubscribers represent the total number of discrete services we provide to customers at the end of the period.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscribers </td> <td> </td> <td>750,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>818,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>744,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nLevel of Subscription Revenue and Hardware Revenue\nWe have historically been focused on growing our recurring subscription revenue base and entering into more fully bundled deals. As a result of an increase in the total subscriber base, and due to new and existing subscribers moving to fully-bundled subscriptions, subscription revenue has increased as a percentage of revenue. In fiscal year 2021, subscription-based revenues accounted for 89.3% of our total revenues, up from 87.6% in 2020 and 85.7% in 2019. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the level of business disruption as a result of the spread of COVID-19, the Company suspended its practice of issuing financial guidance during fiscal 2021 and has also not provided guidance for fiscal 2022.\nAs market conditions improve globally, we believe that we will be well positioned to grow our base of subscribers, by adding both fully-bundled subscriptions; subscriptions where the hardware has been purchased upfront and various add-on solutions that can drive incremental average revenue per user ( ARPU\u201d) expansion over time. We intend to maintain our investment in sales and marketing and continue to attract new subscribers by introducing attractive new features and services.\nAdditionally, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our fleet management market share among our existing customer base by demonstrating our value proposition, growing with the customer, introducing new and innovative value-added solutions and displacing legacy fleet management solutions.\nFluctuations in Exchange Rates\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented a substantial portion of our total revenue. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, will negatively affect our reported income and expenses as expressed in U.S. Dollars (our reporting currency). The South African Rand is the functional currency for the Company. Currency fluctuations in the South African Rand may positively or negatively impact our reported income and expenses due to the effects of translating the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries into Rand at different average exchange rates and then translating into our reporting currency of U.S. Dollars.\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Rand weakened by 10.8% against the U.S. Dollar and by 13.7% against the British Pound, as shown in the table below.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Average exchange rate for Fiscal Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South African Rand for U.S. Dollars (per $1.00) </td> <td>13.75 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.78 </td> <td> </td> <td>16.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% movement </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South African Rand for British Pound (per \u00a31.00) </td> <td>18.03 </td> <td> </td> <td>18.78 </td> <td> </td> <td>21.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% movement </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect continued exchange rate volatility in the South African Rand against other major currencies. The South African Rand has been even more volatile due to the uncertain economic conditions including the effect of COVID-19 and it is uncertain how long this will continue. As of June 10, 2021, the South African Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 13.65, 16.6% stronger than the average exchange rate for fiscal 2021.\nMix of Subscribers with Different Revenue and Cost Economics\nWe offer services to a wide range of customers, from large enterprise vehicle fleets to small fleet operators and consumers. The subscription revenue and cost per subscriber and the subscriber retention pattern differ by type of subscriber. For example, our entry-level consumer solution, Beam-e, is characterized by lower revenue and lower cost per subscriber compared to our large enterprise solutions. Small fleet and consumer customers will enter into and terminate contracts much more frequently than our enterprise customers, thereby affecting subscriber retention. As the mix of our subscriber base evolves, the average revenue per subscriber and average cost per subscriber is likely to change.\nVarying Economic Conditions in our Markets\nWe seek to capitalize on opportunities and manage risks in our key markets, which are geographically dispersed with subscribers located in more than 120 countries worldwide. Overall, we believe that our presence across multiple geographic markets and our exposure to multiple economies provides us with diversification from the risk of changing economic conditions in any one country or region. Other macroeconomic factors, such as expectations for future crude oil and natural gas prices, affect our customers' spending habits. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices, or the perception that such prices will decrease in the future, negatively impacts our net subscriber growth and hardware sales in this sector. In addition to macroeconomic changes, performance in any given region may vary due to multiple factors, including growth in subscribers, the overall profile of the customer base (for example, in Africa, we have a significant consumer subscriber base), the services and hardware options selected by particular subscribers and our distribution strategy in the region.\nChanges in regional conditions require management to formulate strategic responses that safeguard our financial position and maintain our balanced approach to producing revenue growth, profitability and cash flow.\nChanging Customer Needs and Ongoing Investment in Technology\nWe continuously analyze market trends and opportunities in the various geographies in which we operate and have identified an opportunity to increase subscription revenue growth by the addition of new products and services in certain of the regions in which we operate. Our investment in software development is core to our business strategy. Our software teams employ an agile software development methodology. We have made a significant investment in product development, and we have routinely been among the first to market with innovative solutions and features that cater to the needs of our customers. For example, major updates to the MiX Vision solution were made in fiscal year 2021, with MiX Vision AI poised for launch in calendar year 2021.\nLong Sales Cycle for Our Enterprise Fleet Management Solutions\nFrom period to period, our revenues may fluctuate depending upon the customer contracts we have secured. The typical sales cycle for large enterprise fleet management solutions contracts may be long, especially in comparison to the sales cycle for our consumer solutions. It may also be difficult for us to predict the timing of when we will enter into enterprise fleet management contracts.\nLonger sales cycles for large contracts, for both customers who purchase in-vehicle devices and those who opt for the fully bundled option, may affect the comparability of financial results in certain segments. Our revenue may fluctuate from period to period depending on the level and timing of hardware sales, while subscription revenue growth is also impacted by the timing of the rollout of large enterprise fleets. We are focused on mitigating these long sales cycles and the associated volatility by enhancing our sales pipeline management process, by increasing our sales and marketing investment levels across all geographical segments and by diversifying our customer segment focus.\nInvestment in Sales and Marketing\nWe offer our solutions in over 120 countries through a combination of our direct and indirect marketing efforts. Our sales and marketing strategy is segmented by geographic region and customer type in order to cost effectively target and acquire new customers. In certain regions, we sell subscriptions of our fleet management solutions to large enterprise fleets through our direct sales force. In other regions, and for sales to small fleet operators and consumers, we work with an extensive distribution network of regional partners and national distribution dealers. Through our central services organization headquartered in South Africa, we provide optimized marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our regional sales and marketing operations. We continue to focus on growth and expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base and to expand within existing customers.\nBasis of Presentation and Key Components of Our Results of Operations\nIn fiscal year 2021, we managed our business in six segments which include Africa, Americas, Brazil, Europe and the Middle East and Australasia (our regional sales offices ( RSOs\u201d)), and our central services organization ( CSO\u201d). CSO is our central services organization that wholesales our products and services to our RSOs which, in turn, interface with our end-customers, distributors and dealers. CSO is also responsible for the development of our hardware and software platforms and provides common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our other operating segments.\nThe CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the reportable segments, has been identified collectively as the executive committee and the Chief Executive Officer who make strategic decisions. Segment performance is measured and evaluated by the CODM using Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure which uses net income, determined under International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS\u201d) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, as a starting point. Prior to the publication of the financial results for the year ended March 31, 2020, we published results under IFRS only, which is the reason for the CODM using a segment performance measure based on IFRS.\nIn determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the margin generated by CSO, net of any unrealized intercompany profit, is allocated to the geographic region where the external revenue is recorded by our RSOs. The costs remaining in CSO relate mainly to research and development of hardware and software platforms, common marketing, product management and technical and distribution support to each of the RSOs.\nEach RSO's results reflect the external revenue earned, as well as the Segment Adjusted EBITDA earned (or loss incurred) before the remaining CSO and corporate costs allocations. Segment assets are not disclosed as this information is not reviewed by the CODM.\nRevenue\nThe majority of our revenue is subscription-based. Consequently, growth in subscribers influences our subscription revenue growth. However, other factors, including, but not limited to, the types of new subscribers we add and the timing of entry into subscription contracts also play a significant role. The price and terms of our customer subscription contracts vary based on a number of factors, including fleet size, hardware options, geographic region and distribution channel. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which are used to collect, generate and transmit the data used to enable our SaaS solutions.\nOur customer contracts typically have a three to five year initial term. Following the initial term, most fleet customers elect to renew for fixed terms ranging from one to five years. Our third party dealers are typically billed monthly based on active connections. Some of our customer agreements, including our consumer subscriptions, provide for automatic monthly or yearly renewals unless the customer elects not to renew its subscription. Our consumer customer contracts in South Africa are governed by the Consumer Protection Act, which allows customers to cancel without paying the full balance of the contract amount. Our fleet contracts and our customer contracts outside of South Africa are generally non-cancellable.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue associated with our subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to cellular communications, infrastructure hosting, third-party data providers, service contract maintenance costs, commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors (commission is capitalized and amortized unless the amortization period is 12 months or less) and depreciation of our capitalized installed in-vehicle devices. Cost of sales associated with our hardware revenue includes the cost of the in-vehicle devices, cost of hardware warranty, shipping costs, custom duties, and commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors. We capitalize the cost of in-vehicle devices utilized to service customers, for customers selecting our bundled option, and we depreciate these costs from the date of installation over their expected useful lives.\nWe expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period depending on our revenue mix, including the proportion of our revenue attributable to our subscription-based services. The majority of the other components of our cost of revenue are variable and are affected by the number of subscribers, the composition of our subscriber base, and the number of new subscriptions sold in the period.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages to sales and marketing employees, commissions paid to employees, travel-related expenses, and advertising and promotional costs. We pay our sales employees commissions based on achieving subscription targets and we capitalize commission and amortize it (unless the amortization period is 12 months or less). Advertising costs consist primarily of costs for print, radio and television advertising, promotions, public relations, customer events, tradeshows and sponsorships. We expense advertising costs as incurred. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to grow our sales and build brand and category awareness.\nAdministration and Other Charges\nAdministration and other charges consist primarily of salaries and wages for administrative staff, travel costs, professional fees (including audit and legal fees), real estate leasing costs, expensed research and development costs and depreciation of fixed assets including vehicles and office equipment and amortization of intangible assets. We expect that administration and other charges will increase in absolute terms as we continue to grow our business.\nResearch and Development\nFor additional disclosures in respect of research and development, technology and intellectual property please refer to Item 1. Business\u201d.\nTaxes\nIn fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 our effective tax rates were 39.9%, 47.2% and 15.3% respectively, compared to a South African statutory rate of 28%. Taxation mainly consists of normal statutory income tax paid or payable and deferred tax on any temporary differences.\nOur effective tax rate may vary primarily according to the mix of profits made in various jurisdictions and the impact of certain non-deductible/(non-taxable) foreign exchange movements, net of tax. A reconciliation of the actual tax rate to the South African tax rate of 28% is disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. As a result, significant variances in future periods may occur.\nResults of operations\nThe following table sets forth certain Consolidated Statement of Income data:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td>

fiscal year 2021. The principal factors affecting our revenue contraction included:\n\u2022Subscription revenue decreased by 11.1% to $113.4 million, compared to $127.6 million for fiscal year 2020. Subscription revenue represented 89.3% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2021 compared to 87.6% for the prior year. Subscription revenues decreased by 6.1% on a constant currency basis, year over year. The decline in constant currency subscription revenue was primarily due to the contraction in our subscriber base as a result of economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal year 2021, our subscriber base contracted by 73,800 subscribers to 744,700 subscribers at March 31, 2021. We experienced fleet contraction in a number of key verticals such as the oil and gas vertical, consumer vertical and leasing vertical which impacted both our subscriber-count and subscription revenue line, the contraction is mainly attributable to our low ARPU asset tracking subscribers.\nThe majority of our revenues and subscription revenues are derived from currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against these currencies (in particular against the South African Rand) following currency volatility arising from the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, has negatively impacted our revenue and subscription revenues reported in U.S. Dollars. Compared to fiscal year 2020, the South African Rand weakened by 11% against the U.S. Dollar. The Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate averaged R16.37 in fiscal year 2021 compared to an average of R14.78 during fiscal year 2020. The impact of translating foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates during fiscal year 2021 led to a 5.0% reduction in reported U.S. Dollar subscription revenues.\n\u2022Hardware and other revenue decreased by $4.5 million, or 25.1%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 primarily as a result of a global economic slowdown following the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

This resulted in a lower gross profit margin of 63.6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to 67.4% in fiscal year 2019.\nDuring fiscal 2020, subscription revenue gross profit margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to accelerated depreciation of in-vehicle devices following contraction in certain fleets in the oil and gas vertical in the Americas segment.\nDuring fiscal 2020, hardware and other margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to the geographical sales mix and the distribution channels. Hardware sales via our dealer channel attract lower gross margins. In addition there is pricing pressure on hardware prices as customers look to reduce the upfront cost of their investment.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing costs decreased by $1.2 million or 8.0%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020 against a 1.4% increase in total revenue. The decrease in fiscal year 2020 was primarily as a result of a $0.5 million decrease in bonuses, a $0.5 million decrease in salaries and wages, a $0.1 million decrease in foreign travel costs and other decreases of $0.1 million, none of which were individually significant. In fiscal year 2020, sales and marketing costs represented 9.1% of revenue compared to 10.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2019.\nAdministration and Other Expenses\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administration and other </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdministration and other expenses increased by $0.2 million or 0.4%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.\nThe increase mainly relates to increases in expected credit loss provision primarily in the South Africa business of $1.9 million mainly, professional fees of $0.9 million, offset by saving in bonuses of $1.3 million primarily due to lower subscription revenue growth being achieved, salaries and wages of $0.8 million and operating lease costs of $0.4 million.\nTaxation\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate </td> <td>39.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>47.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense increased by 0.1%, while our effective tax rate increased by 7.3% to 47.2% in fiscal year 2020. A reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the South African corporate tax rate of 28% for both fiscal years 2020 and 2019, is presented in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2020 the effective tax rate increased by 19.6% as a result of certain non-deductible foreign exchange movements on intercompany loans which have led to deferred tax charges being recognized in the Income Statement. In fiscal 2019 non-deductible foreign exchange differences increased the tax rate by 14.0%.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the last three fiscal years. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset these higher costs through price increases. Our inability to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nWe use certain measures to assess the financial performance of our business. Certain of these measures are termed non-GAAP measures\u201d because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and constant currency information.\nAn explanation of the relevance of each of the non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and a discussion of their limitations is set out below. We do not regard these non-GAAP measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures"}
