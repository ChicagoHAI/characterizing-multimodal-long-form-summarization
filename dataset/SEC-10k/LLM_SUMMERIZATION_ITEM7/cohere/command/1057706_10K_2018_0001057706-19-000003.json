Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of First BanCorp. and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and the notes thereto. This section also presents certain financial measures that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). See Basis of Presentation\u201d below for information about why the non-GAAP financial measures are being presented and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures for which the reconciliation is not presented earlier.\nDescription of Business\nFirst BanCorp. is a diversified financial holding company headquartered in San Juan, Puerto Rico offering a full range of financial products to consumers and commercial customers through various subsidiaries. First BanCorp. is the holding company (the Holding Company\u201d) of FirstBank Puerto Rico and FirstBank Insurance Agency. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Corporation operates offices in Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands, and the State of Florida (USA), concentrating on commercial banking, residential mortgage loan originations, finance leases, credit cards, personal loans, small loans, auto loans, and insurance agency activities. On August 1, 2018, the Bank's Board of Directors approved a resolution to dissolve the broker-dealer subsidiary FirstBank Securities. Accordingly, FirstBank Securities filed the required Form BDW for the withdrawal of its registration from the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and its license to operate as broker-dealer was terminated effective September 30, 2018. Management is in the process of completing the dissolution of FirstBank Securities as a legal entity under the state laws.\nEXECUTIVE Overview of Results of Operations\nFirst BanCorp.'s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest-earning assets, including investment securities and loans, and the interest expense incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by various factors, including: the interest rate scenario; the volumes, mix and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; and the re-pricing characteristics of these assets and liabilities. The Corporation's results of operations also depend on the provision for loan and lease losses, non-interest expenses (such as personnel, occupancy, the deposit insurance premium and other costs), non-interest income (mainly service charges and fees on deposits, and insurance income), gains (losses) on sales of investments, gains (losses) on mortgage banking activities, and income taxes.\nThe Corporation had net income of $201.6 million, or $0.92 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a $67.0 million, or $0.30 per diluted common share, for 2017, and $93.2 million, or $0.43 per diluted common share, for 2016.\nThe key drivers of the Corporation's GAAP financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, include the following:\n\u00b7 Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $525.4 million compared to $491.6 million and $484.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by: (i) a $17.2 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans, primarily associated with the upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans; (ii) a $9.1 million increase in interest income on investment securities, primarily due to the gradual reinvestment of liquidity and proceeds from maturing debt securities into higher-yielding U.S. agencies debt securities and MBS; (iii) a $7.5 million increase in interest income on consumer loans, mainly due to a $77.8 million increase in the average balance of this portfolio, primarily auto loans and finance leases; and (iv) a $6.5 million increase in interest income from interest-bearing cash balances, primarily deposits maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, due to both a higher average balance and increases in the Federal Funds target rate.\nThese variances were partially offset by: (i) a $3.7 million decrease in interest income on residential mortgage loans, primarily associated with an $81.2 million decrease in the average balance of this portfolio; and (ii) a $2.7 million increase in total interest expense, driven an increase in the use of long-term FHLB advances during 2018 and higher market interest rates on the cost of retail CDs and commercial money market accounts tied to variable short-term interest rates, partially offset by a $480.3 million decrease in the average balance of brokered CDs.\nThe net interest margin increased to 4.55% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 4.36% for 2017, primarily due to the aforementioned upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans, the gradual reinvestment of liquidity in higher-yielding securities, and an improved funding mix, driven by the increase in the proportion of interest-earning assets funded by the growth in non-interest bearing deposits.\nThe increase for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by: (i) a $12.5 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans, primarily associated with both the upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans and the growth of the performing commercial portfolios, primarily in the Florida region; (ii) a $4.3 million decrease in interest expense, including a decrease of $2.8 million in interest expense on brokered CDs, primarily related to a $509.0 million decrease in the average balance of brokered CDs that offset higher costs on new issuances, and a $9.3 million decrease in interest expense on repurchase agreements, primarily reflecting the full-year effect of the repayment of $400 million of repurchase agreements that matured in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and carried an average cost of 3.35%, partially offset by increases of $5.2 million and $2.0 million in interest expense on FHLB advances and non-brokered deposits, respectively; and (iii) a $1.2 million increase in interest income from deposits maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, due to increases in the Federal Funds target rate in 2017 and late in 2016.\nThe aforementioned variances were partially offset by: (i) a $5.6 million decrease in interest income on consumer loans and finance leases, primarily reflecting a $33.5 million decrease in the average balance of this portfolio, primarily auto loans, and, to a lesser extent, the effect of a $1.4 million decrease in late payment fees as the Corporation did not assess late charges during the fourth quarter of 2017 to customers affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria that qualified for the three-month payment deferral program established by the Corporation after the hurricanes; and (ii) a $5.3 million decrease in interest income on residential mortgage loans, reflecting both a higher level of inflows of residential mortgage loans to non-performing status and a $41.8 million decrease in the average balance of this portfolio.\n\u00b7 The provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $59.3 million compared to $144.3 million and $86.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2018, the Corporation recorded a net loan loss reserve release of $16.9 million in connection with revised estimates of the hurricane-related qualitative reserves associated with the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, compared to hurricane-related charges to the provision of $71.3 million recorded in 2017. See Results of Operations - Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d below for details about the Corporation's approach to the estimation of hurricane-related qualitative reserves. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the aforementioned effects of the hurricane-related qualitative reserves, the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses for 2018 was $76.2 million compared to $73.0 million and $86.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by a $26.2 million increase in the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses for commercial and construction loans, driven by charges of $22.3 million related to developments in problem loans resolution strategies, including a $15.7 million charge on loans transferred to held for sale during 2018, partially offset by a $22.6 million decrease in the adjusted provision for residential mortgage loans, primarily reflecting a decline in charge-offs, nonaccrual and delinquent loan levels, and the overall decrease in the size of this portfolio.\nThe decrease in the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by: (i) a $22.1 million decrease in the adjusted provision for commercial and construction loans reflecting, among other things, lower specific reserve requirements for impaired loans and a $2.9 million increase in loan loss recoveries; and (ii) a $2.8 million decrease in the adjusted provision for consumer loans and finance leases, mainly related to lower levels of personal and small loans delinquencies. These variances were partially offset by an $11.1 million increase in the adjusted provision for residential mortgage loans, primarily related to a higher level of residential nonaccrual loans, increased specific reserves for residential mortgage TDRs, and higher loss severity estimates in 2017.\nSee Basis of Presentation\u201d below for additional information and reconciliation of the provision for loan and lease losses in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP adjusted provision for loan and lease losses.\nNet charge-offs totaled $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 1.09% of average loans, a decrease of $23.3 million, compared to net charge-offs of $118.0 million, or 1.33% of average loans, for 2017 and $121.8 million, or 1.37% of average loans, for 2016. The decrease in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily reflects a $24.0 million decrease in net charge-offs taken on commercial and construction loans and a $4.4 million decrease in net charge-offs of residential mortgage loans, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in net charge-offs taken on consumer loans. During 2018, the Corporation recorded a loan loss recovery of $7.4 million on a commercial mortgage TDR loan paid off during the year compared to charge-offs of $27.3 million taken on such loan in 2017. This variance was partially offset by the effect in 2018 of charge-offs totaling $12.5 million taken on nonaccrual commercial and construction loans transferred to held for sale. See Results of Operations - Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d and Risk Management - Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Non-Performing Assets\u201d below for an analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses and non-performing assets and related ratios.\n\u00b7 The Corporation recorded non-interest income of $82.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $62.4 million and $88.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by: (i) the effect in 2017 of a $12.2 million other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) charge on three Puerto Rico Government debt securities, specifically bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority; (ii) a $3.7 million increase in revenues from mortgage banking activities, driven by adjustments recorded in 2018 that reduced the valuation allowance of mortgage servicing rights and higher servicing fees; (iii) a $3.6 million increase in fee-based income from ATMs, POS, credit and debit cards, and merchant-related activities; and (iv) a $1.2 million increase in gains from sales of fixed assets, primarily assets of relocated or closed banking branches in Florida and Puerto Rico. These variances were partially offset by a $2.8 million net loss recorded on sales of nonaccrual commercial and construction loans held for sale completed in 2018.\nThe decrease for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by: (i) a $6.9 million decrease in revenues from mortgage banking activities, primarily due to lower conforming loan origination and sales volume associated with both the drop in business activity in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands after the hurricanes and higher market interest rates; (ii) the effect in 2016 of a $6.1 million gain on sales of $198.7 million of U.S. agency MBS; (iii) a $5.9 million increase in OTTI charges on bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority; (iv) a $2.9 million decrease in gains associated with repurchases and cancellations of trust-preferred securities; (v) the effect in 2016 of a $1.5 million gain from the recovery of a residual collateralized mortgage obligation ( CMO\u201d) previously written off; and (vi) the effect in 2016 of brokerage and insurance commissions of $1.8 million, primarily related to the sale of large fixed annuities contracts.\n\u00b7 Non-interest expenses for 2018 were $357.8 million compared to $347.7 million and $355.1 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by: (i) a $7.6 million increase in employees' compensation and benefit expenses reflecting, among other things, salary merit increases and adjustments related to the Corporation's annual salary review process, higher headcount, and an increase in the Bank's matching contribution to the employees' retirement plans; (ii) a $3.5 million increase in losses from OREO operations reflecting, among other things, a $2.1 million increase in adverse fair value adjustments to the value of OREO properties and a $1.3 million increase in OREO operating expenses, including taxes, insurance and maintenance fees; (iii) a $2.3 million increase in business promotion expenses, primarily due to increased advertising, marketing, promotions and sponsorship-related activities during 2018; and (iv) a $1.3 million increase in occupancy and equipment costs, primarily due to hurricane-related expenses incurred in 2018 associated with repairs and security matters. These variances were partially offset by a $4.8 million decrease in the FDIC insurance premium expense due to, among other things, improved earnings trends, reduction in brokered CDs, and higher liquidity levels tied to the growth in non-interest bearing deposits.\nThe decrease for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to: (i) a $6.3 million decrease in the FDIC insurance premium expense, mainly related to the effect of reductions in brokered deposits and average assets, a strengthened capital position, and improved liquidity metrics; (ii) a $2.1 million decrease in the provision for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit; (iii) a $0.8 million decrease in write-downs, loss on sales and expenses related to non-real estate repossessed assets; (iv) a $0.6 million decrease in communications-related matters such as telephone and postage expenses; (v) a $0.6 million decrease in taxes, other than income taxes, primarily related to decreases in the sales and use tax expense and in municipal license taxes in Puerto Rico; (vi) a $0.5 million decrease in losses from OREO operations, primarily reflecting a $1.8 million decrease in write-downs to the value of OREO properties, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in rental income from commercial OREO income-producing properties; and (vii) a $0.4 million decrease in credit and debit card processing expenses, primarily associated with a lower volume of transactions affected by the drop in business activity after the hurricanes in 2017. These variances were partially offset by: (i) a $1.8 million increase in professional service fees, primarily reflecting higher consulting fees related to the implementation of new technology systems and higher outsourcing fees related to network services; (ii) a $1.5 million increase in occupancy and equipment costs, primarily due to higher electricity expenses, property taxes and rental expenses; (iii) a $1.1 million increase in business promotion expenses, reflecting the effect in 2016 of a $2.7 million adjustment recorded to reduce the credit card rewards program liability due to the expiration of reward points earned by customers up to September 2013 (the conversion date of the credit card portfolio acquired from FIA in May 2012) and costs of approximately $1.0 million related to hurricane relief efforts and assistance to employees incurred in 2017, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease associated with lower advertising and marketing-related activities.\n\u00b7 For 2018, the Corporation recorded an income tax benefit of $11.0 million compared to income tax benefit of $5.0 million for 2017 and income tax expense of $37.0 million for 2016. The income tax benefit recorded in 2018 reflects, among other things, the effect of a $63.2 million benefit related to a partial reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, partially offset by a one-time charge of $9.9 million associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets resulting from the enactment of Act 257 (net of the $5.6 million related impact in the valuation allowance). The income tax benefit recorded in 2017 reflects the effect of the tax benefit related to hurricane-related charges to the provision for loan and lease losses and a $13.2 million tax benefit recorded as a result of the change in tax status of certain subsidiaries from taxable corporations to limited liability companies that have elected to be treated as partnerships for income tax purposes in Puerto Rico. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had a net deferred tax asset of $319.9 million (net of a valuation allowance of $100.7 million, including a valuation allowance of $68.1 million against the deferred tax assets of the Corporation's banking subsidiary, FirstBank). See Results of Operations - Income Taxes\u201d below for additional information.\n\u00b7 As of December 31, 2018, total assets were approximately $12.2 billion, a decrease of $17.7 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease primarily reflects a $130.2 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, largely driven by liquidity used for the repayment of $657.9 million of maturing brokered CDs, the repayment of $200 million of repurchase agreements, the repurchase of $23.8 million of trust-preferred securities, and liquidity reinvested in higher-yielding U.S. agencies debt and MBS, partially offset by liquidity obtained from the growth in non-interest bearing deposits. In addition, the OREO portfolio balance decreased by $16.5 million.\nThe aforementioned decreases were partially offset by a $51.6 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities, driven by purchases of U.S agencies MBS and debt securities, a $25.0 million increase in the net deferred tax asset, and a $17.9 million increase in total loans. The decrease in total loans reflects a growth of $168.6 million in the Florida region, partially offset by decreases of $103.4 million and $47.4 million in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, respectively. Total loans for 2018 reflect an increase in the consumer loan portfolio of $194.8 million, partially offset by reductions of $125.4 million and $51.6 million in the residential mortgage and commercial and construction loan portfolios, respectively. The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $35.5 million during 2018 reflecting, among other things, the effect of releases associated with revised estimates of the hurricane-related qualitative reserve. See Financial Condition and Operating Data Analysis - Assets\u201d below for additional information.\n\u00b7 As of December 31, 2018, total liabilities were $10.2 billion, a decrease of $193.3 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly related to: (i) a $594.9 million decrease in brokered CDs; (ii) a $149.9 million decrease in repurchase agreements; and (iii) the repurchase of $23.8 million of trust-preferred securities. These reductions were partially offset by a $318.2 million increase in deposits, excluding brokered CDs and government deposits, a $248.8 million increase in government deposits, and a $25.0 million increase in FHLB advances. A significant portion of the increase in non-brokered deposits was in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which grew 31%, or $561.8 million which, in part, reflects the effect of hurricane-related factors such as settlements of insurance claims and disaster relief funds. See Risk Management - Liquidity and Capital Adequacy\u201d below for additional information about the Corporation's funding sources.\n\u00b7 As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation's stockholders' equity was $2.0 billion, an increase of $175.6 million from December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly driven by the earnings generated in 2018, partially offset by the decrease in the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities recorded as part of other comprehensive loss in total equity and dividends paid on preferred and common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2018, for the first time since June 2009, the Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per common share, or an aggregate of $6.5 million. In addition, the Corporation continued to pay monthly dividends on its non-cumulative perpetual monthly income preferred stock totaling $2.7 million in 2018. The Corporation's Total Capital, Common equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Leverage ratios calculated under the Basel III rules were 24.00%, 20.30%, 20.71%, and 15.37%, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, compared to Total Capital, Common equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Leverage ratios of 22.53%, 18.96%, 18.97%, and 14.03%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. The Corporation's tangible common equity ratio increased to 16.14% as of December 31, 2018, from 14.65% as of December 31, 2017. See Risk Management - Capital\u201d below for additional information.\n\u00b7 Total loan production, including purchases, refinancings, renewals and draws from existing revolving and non-revolving commitments, was $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, excluding the utilization activity on outstanding credit cards. Total loan originations in the Puerto Rico region of $2.4 billion increased by $304.4 million, compared to 2017. The growth in the Puerto Rico region consisted of increases of $237.6 million, $45.5 million, and $21.3 million in consumer, residential, and commercial loans, respectively. In addition, total loan originations in the Virgin Islands increased by $26.9 million. Total loan originations in the Florida region decreased by $92.4 million, primarily reflected in lower residential mortgage loan originations.\n\u00b7 Total non-performing assets were $467.1 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $183.5 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to: (i) the restoration to accrual status of two large commercial loans totaling $69.7 million; (ii) sales of $61.9 million of nonaccrual commercial and construction loans held for sale; (iii) collections on commercial and construction nonaccrual loans of $32.3 million; (iv) commercial and construction nonaccrual loan charge-offs totaling $40.3 million; (v) a $31.0 million decrease in residential nonaccrual loans, and (vi) a $16.5 million decrease in the OREO portfolio balance. These variances were partially offset by the inflow of two large commercial mortgage loans totaling $69.8 million related to a legacy commercial loan relationship that operates in both the Florida and Puerto Rico regions with independent sources of repayment. See Risk Management - Non-accruing and Non-performing Assets\u201d below for additional information.\n\u00b7 Adversely classified commercial and construction loans, including loans held for sale, decreased by $126.4 million to $356.0 million as of December 31, 2018, driven primarily by the sale of five large commercial and construction loans totaling $66.1 million, the upgrade in the credit risk classification of several commercial loans totaling $125.7 million, and collections and charge-offs recorded during 2018. These variances were partially offset by the downgrade in the credit risk classification of three large commercial loans totaling $110.4 million, including the aforementioned $69.8 million in two large commercial loans classified as nonaccrual during 2018.\nThe Corporation's financial results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 included the following significant items that management believes are not reflective of core operating performance, are not expected to reoccur with any regularity or may reoccur at uncertain times and in uncertain amounts (the Special Items\u201d):\nYear ended December 31, 2018\n\u00b7 Tax benefit of $63.2 million resulting from the partial reversal of the Corporation's deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\n\u00b7 One-time charge to the income tax expense of $9.9 million related to the enactment of the Puerto Rico Tax Reform of 2018, specifically in connection with the reduction of the Corporation's deferred tax assets as a result of the decrease in the maximum corporate tax rate in Puerto Rico from 39% to 37.5%.\n\u00b7 Net loan loss reserve releases of $16.9 million ($10.3 million after-tax) in connection with revised estimates of the qualitative reserves associated with the effects of Hurricanes Maria and Irma.

See Results of Operation - Non-Interest Income\u201d below for additional information.\nYear ended December 31, 2017\n\u00b7 Tax benefit of $13.2 million associated with the change in tax status of certain subsidiaries from taxable corporations to limited liability companies that made an election to be treated as partnerships for income tax purposes in Puerto Rico. See Income Taxes\u201d discussion below for additional information.\n\u00b7 Charges to the provision for loan and lease losses of $71.3 million ($43.5 million after-tax) related to the estimate of inherent losses resulting from the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.\n\u00b7 Hurricane-related expenses of $2.5 million ($1.6 million after-tax).\n\u00b7 Expected insurance recoveries of $1.8 million for compensation and rental costs that the Corporation incurred when Hurricanes Maria and Irma precluded employees from working in 2017.\n\u00b7 OTTI charge of $12.2 million and a $0.4 million recovery of previously recorded OTTI charges on non-performing bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority sold in 2017.

The costs, incurred at the holding company level, had no effect on the income tax expense in 2017.\nYear ended December 31, 2016\n\u00b7 OTTI charges of $6.7 million on debt securities, primarily on the aforementioned bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority. No tax benefit was recognized for the OTTI charges in 2016.\n\u00b7 Gain of $6.1 million ($5.9 million after-tax) on sales of $198.7 million of U.S. agency MBS that carried an average yield of 2.36%.\n\u00b7 Gain of $4.2 million on the repurchase and cancellation of $10 million in trust-preferred securities, reflected in the consolidated statements of income as Gain on early extinguishment of debt.\u201d The gain, realized at the holding company level, had no effect on the income tax expense in 2016.\n\u00b7 Adjustment of $2.7 million ($1.7 million after tax) recorded to reduce the credit card rewards program liability due to the expiration of reward points earned by customers up to September 2013 (the conversion date of the credit card portfolio acquired from FIA in May 2012).

of the Corporation and the methods of applying these principles conform to GAAP. The Corporation's critical accounting policies relate to: 1) the allowance for loan and lease losses; 2) OTTI; 3) income taxes; 4) the classification and values of financial instruments; 5) income recognition on loans; 6) loans acquired; and 7) loans held for sale. These critical accounting policies involve judgments, estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the amounts recorded for assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from estimates, if different assumptions or conditions prevail. Certain determinations inherently require greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than those originally reported.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe Corporation maintains the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level considered adequate to absorb incurred losses currently inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The Corporation does not maintain an allowance for held-for-sale loans or PCI loans that are performing in accordance with or better than expectations as of the date of acquisition, as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component. The allowance for loan and lease losses provides for probable incurred losses that have been identified with specific valuation allowances for individually evaluated impaired loans and for probable incurred losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio that have not been specifically identified. The determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses requires significant estimates, including with respect to the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, consideration of current economic conditions and business strategies, and historical loss experience pertaining to the portfolios and pools of homogeneous loans, all of which may be susceptible to change.\nThe Corporation evaluates the need for changes to the allowance by portfolio loan segments and classes of loans within certain of those portfolio segments. The Corporation combines loans with similar credit risk characteristics into the following portfolio segments: commercial mortgage, construction, commercial and industrial, residential mortgage, and consumer loans. Classes are usually disaggregations of the portfolio segments. The classes within the residential mortgage segment are residential mortgages guaranteed by the U.S. government and other residential loans. The classes within the consumer portfolio are auto, finance lease, and other consumer loans. Other consumer loans mainly include unsecured personal loans, credit cards, home equity lines, lines of credits, and marine financing. The classes within the construction loan portfolio are land loans, construction of commercial projects, and construction of residential projects. The commercial mortgage and commercial and industrial segments are not further segmented into classes. The adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is based on judgments related to the credit quality of each portfolio segment. These judgments consider ongoing evaluations of each portfolio segment, including such factors as the economic risks associated with each loan class, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the geography (Puerto Rico, Florida or the Virgin Islands), the level of delinquent loans, historical loss experience, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. In addition to the general economic conditions and other factors described above, additional factors considered include the internal risk ratings assigned to loans. An internal risk rating is assigned to each commercial and construction loan at the time of approval and is subject to subsequent periodic review by the Corporation's senior management. The allowance for loan and lease losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis as part of the Corporation's continued evaluation of its asset quality.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through a provision for credit losses that is charged to earnings, based on the quarterly evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, and is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses consists of specific reserves based upon valuations of loans considered to be impaired and general reserves. A specific valuation allowance is established for individual impaired loans in the commercial mortgage, construction, and commercial and industrial portfolios and certain boat loans, residential mortgage loans, and home equity lines of credit, primarily when the collateral value of the loan (if the impaired loan is determined to be collateral dependent) or the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective rate is lower than the carrying amount of that loan. The loans within the commercial mortgage, construction, and commercial and industrial portfolios, and boat loans of $1 million or more are individually evaluated for impairment. Also, certain residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit are individually evaluated for impairment purposes based on their delinquency and loan to value levels. When foreclosure of a collateral dependent loan is probable, the impairment measure is based on the fair value of the collateral. The fair value of the collateral is generally obtained from appraisals. Updated appraisals are obtained when the Corporation determines that loans are impaired and are generally updated annually thereafter according to the Corporation's appraisal policy. In addition, appraisals and/or appraiser price opinions are also obtained for residential mortgage loans based on specific characteristics such as delinquency levels, age of the appraisal, and loan-to-value ratios. The excess of the recorded investment in a collateral dependent loan over the resulting fair value of the collateral is charged-off when deemed uncollectible.\nFor all other loans, which include small, homogeneous loans, such as auto loans, and the other classes in the consumer loan portfolio, residential mortgages and commercial and construction loans not individually evaluated for impairment, the Corporation\nmaintains a general valuation allowance established through a process that begins with estimates of incurred losses based upon various statistical analyses. The general reserve is primarily determined by applying loss factors according to the loan type and assigned risk category (pass, special mention, and substandard loans that are not considered to be impaired; all doubtful loans are considered impaired).\nThe Corporation uses a roll-rate methodology to estimate losses on its consumer loan portfolio based on delinquencies and considering credit bureau score bands. The Corporation tracks the historical portfolio performance to arrive at a weighted-average distribution in each subgroup of each delinquency bucket. Roll-to-loss rates (loss factors) are calculated by multiplying the roll rates from each subgroup within the delinquency buckets forward through loss. Once roll rates are calculated, the resulting loss factor is applied to the existing receivables in the applicable subgroups within the delinquency buckets and the end results are aggregated to arrive at the required allowance level. The Corporation's assessment also involves evaluating key qualitative and environmental factors, which include credit and macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment, bankruptcy trends, recent market transactions, and collateral values to account for current market conditions that are likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical loss experience. The Corporation analyzes the expected delinquency migration to determine the future volume of delinquencies.\nThe cash flow analysis for each residential mortgage pool is performed at the individual loan level and then aggregated to the pool level in determining the overall loss ratio (the base methodology\u201d). The model applies risk-adjusted prepayment curves, default curves, and severity curves to each loan in the pool. For loan restructuring pools, the present value of future cash flows under the new terms, at the loan's effective interest rate, is taken into consideration. Additionally, estimates of default risk and prepayments related to loan restructurings are based on, among other things, the historical experience of these loans. Loss severity is affected by the house price scenario, which is based in part on recent house price trends. Default curves are used in the model. The attributes that are most significant to the probability of default include present collection status (current, delinquent, in bankruptcy, in foreclosure stage), vintage, loan-to-values, and geography (Puerto Rico, Florida or the Virgin Islands). The estimates of the risk-adjusted timing of liquidations and associated costs are used in the model, and are risk-adjusted for the geographic area in which each property is located.\nFor commercial loans, historical charge-off rates are calculated by the Corporation on a quarterly basis for each commercial loan regulatory-based credit risk category (i.e. pass, special mention, substandard, and doubtful) using the historical charge-offs and portfolio balances over their average loss emergence period (the raw loss rate\u201d) for each credit risk classification. However, when not enough loss experience is observed in a particular risk-rated category and the calculation results in a loss rate for such risk-rated category that is lower than the loss rate of a less severe risk-rated category, the Corporation uses the loss rate of such less severe category. A qualitative factor adjustment is applied to the base rate average utilizing a resulting factor derived from a set of risk-based ratings and weights assigned to credit and economic indicators over a reasonable period applied to a developed expected range of historical losses and a basis point adjustment derived from the difference between the average raw loss rate and the highest loss rate observed during a look-back period that management determined was appropriate to use for each region to identify any relevant effect during an economic cycle.\nHurricane-related Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nDuring 2017, management established a separate qualitative element of the allowance to estimate inherent losses associated with the effect of Hurricanes Maria and Irma on the Corporation's loan portfolios in Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands. This qualitative element of the allowance was initially determined based on the estimated effect that the hurricanes could have on employment levels (e.g., an unemployment rate that significantly increases from levels in Puerto Rico at the time of the hurricanes based on statistics observed in the aftermath of similar natural disasters in the U.S. mainland like Hurricane Katrina), economic activity in the Corporation's geographic regions, and the time it could take for the affected regions to return to a more normalized operating environment.\nFor large commercial and construction loan relationships, loan officers performed individual reviews of the effect of the hurricanes on these borrowers' sources of repayment. These large relationships, that represented 80% of the outstanding balance of the Corporation's commercial and construction loan portfolio at the time of the hurricanes, were analyzed and divided into three hurricane-affected categories (i.e. Low, Medium and High). Clients categorized as Low had no effect, or relatively insignificant effect, as a result of the storms. Clients in the Medium category had demonstrated that they had sufficient liquidity to satisfy their obligations, but the complexity of the insurance claim process may affect their primary or secondary source of repayment. Finally, clients categorized as High could potentially have problems with their primary or secondary sources of repayment as they have a higher degree of uncertainty with respect to the timing of the insurance claim resolution, and the full reestablishment of their businesses is highly dependent on the timely receipt of insurance proceeds. Reserve levels were then recognized for these particular loans based on this stratification. For loans in the Low category, no additional qualitative hurricane-related reserve was calculated. For loans in the Medium and High categories, the Corporation stressed the general reserve loss factors applicable to these loans to reflect higher default probabilities not reflected in the historical data.\nThis review also resulted in downgrades in the credit risk classification of certain loans and their reserves were determined following the methodology applicable to criticized and adversely classified loans, as appropriate.\nDuring 2018, the Corporation performed additional procedures to evaluate the adequacy of the qualitative reserve, including the consideration of updated payment patterns and probability of default credit risk analyses applied to consumer loan borrowers subject to payment deferral programs that expired early in 2018. For the determination of the hurricane-related qualitative reserve for residential mortgage loans as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation stressed the loss factors derived from its above-described base methodology by incorporating assumptions of further deterioration in the housing price index and higher loan modification levels. Although the foreclosure moratoriums extended by the FHA to hurricane-affected individuals ended on September 15, 2018, there are likely to be additional delays in foreclosure actions due to court-related backlogs. For the determination of the hurricane-related qualitative reserve for commercial and construction loans not individually reviewed as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation segregated the portfolio based on delinquency levels and stressed the general reserve loss factors applicable to 30-89 days past due loans to reflect higher default probabilities.\nAs a result of the aforementioned analyses, the Corporation recorded a net loan loss reserve release of $16.9 million in 2018 and a charge to the provision of $71.3 million in 2017 associated with the hurricanes. As of December 31, 2018, the hurricane-related qualitative allowance was $19.2 million (2017 - $55.6 million). See Results of Operations - Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d below for additional information, including details about the hurricane-related qualitative allowance segregated by loans portfolio segments.\nCharge-off of Uncollectible Loans - Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balances of loans held for investment that the Corporation determines are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Collateral dependent loans in the construction, commercial mortgage, and commercial and industrial loan portfolios are charged off to their net realizable value (fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell) when loans are considered to be uncollectible. Within the consumer loan portfolio, auto loans and finance leases are reserved once they are 120 days delinquent and are charged off to their estimated net realizable value when the collateral deficiency is deemed uncollectible (i.e., when foreclosure/repossession is probable) or when the loan is 365 days past due. Within the other consumer loan portfolio, closed-end loans are charged off when payments are 120 days in arrears, except small personal loans. Open-end (revolving credit) consumer loans, including credit card loans, and small personal loans are charged off when payments are 180 days in arrears. On a quarterly basis, residential mortgage loans that are 180 days delinquent and have an original loan-to-value ratio that is higher than 60% are reviewed and charged-off, as needed, to the fair value of the underlying collateral. Generally, all loans may be charged off or written down to the fair value of the collateral prior to the application of the policies described above if a loss-confirming event has occurred. Loss-confirming events include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy (unsecured), continued delinquency, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency when the asset is the sole source of repayment. The Corporation does not record charge-offs on PCI loans that are performing in accordance with or better than expectations as of the date of acquisition, as the fair value of these loans already reflects a credit component. The Corporation records charge-offs on PCI loans only if actual losses exceed estimated losses incorporated into the fair value recorded at acquisition and the amount is deemed uncollectible.\nOther-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI\u201d)\nOn a quarterly basis, the Corporation performs an assessment to determine whether there have been any events or economic circumstances indicating that a security with an unrealized loss has suffered an OTTI. A security is considered impaired if the fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. The Corporation employs a systematic methodology that considers all available evidence in evaluating a potential impairment of its investments.\nThe impairment analysis of debt securities places special emphasis on the analysis of the cash position of the issuer and its cash and capital generation capacity, which could increase or diminish the issuer's ability to repay its bond obligations, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, any adverse change to the credit conditions and liquidity of the issuer, taking into consideration the latest information available about the financial condition of the issuer, credit ratings, the failure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments, recent legislation and government actions affecting the issuer's industry, and actions taken by the issuer to deal with the economic climate. The Corporation also takes into consideration changes in the near-term prospects of the underlying collateral of a security, if any, such as changes in default rates, loss severity given default, and significant changes in prepayment assumptions and the level of cash flows generated from the underlying collateral, if any, supporting the principal and interest payments of the debt securities. OTTI must be recognized in earnings if the Corporation has the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. However, even if the Corporation does not expect to sell a debt security, it must evaluate expected cash flows to be received and determine if a credit loss has occurred. An unrealized loss is generally deemed to be other-than-temporary and a credit loss is deemed to exist if the present value of the expected future cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis of the debt security. For available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities the Corporations intends to hold, the credit loss component of an OTTI, if any, is recorded as net impairment losses on debt securities in the statements of income, while the remaining portion of the impairment loss is recognized in OCI, net of taxes, and included as a component of stockholders' equity. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings is the new amortized cost basis of the investment. The new amortized cost basis is not\nadjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Subsequent increases and decreases (if not an OTTI) in the fair value of available-for-sale securities is included in other comprehensive income. For held-to-maturity debt securities, any OTTI recognized in OCI should be accreted from other comprehensive income to the amortized cost of the debt security over the remaining life of the debt security. However, for debt securities for which OTTI was recognized in earnings, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as interest income as long as the security is not placed in nonaccrual status. Debt securities held by the Corporation at year-end primarily consisted of securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities, private label mortgage-backed securities ( MBS\u201d), certain bonds issued by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority, a government instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and obligations of certain municipalities in Puerto Rico. Given the explicit and implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. federal government, the Corporation believes the credit risk in securities issued by the U.S. government-sponsored entities is low. The Corporation's OTTI assessment was concentrated on Puerto Rico government debt securities and private label MBS. For further information, including methodology and assumptions used for the discounted cash flow analyses performed on these securities, refer to Note 5 - Investment Securities, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Corporation is required to estimate income taxes in preparing its consolidated financial statements. This involves the estimation of current income tax expense together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differences in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The determination of current income tax expense involves estimates and assumptions that require the Corporation to assume certain positions based on its interpretation of current tax regulations. Management assesses the relative benefits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance, and recognizes tax benefits only when deemed probable. Changes in assumptions affecting estimates may be required in the future and estimated tax liabilities may need to be increased or decreased accordingly. The accrual of tax contingencies is adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. The Corporation's effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingencies and changes to such accruals, as considered appropriate by management. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by the taxing authorities and finally resolved. Favorable resolution of such matters or the expiration of the statute of limitations may result in the release of tax contingencies that are recognized as a reduction to the Corporation's effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.\nIncome tax expense includes Puerto Rico and USVI income taxes as well as applicable U.S. federal and state taxes. The Corporation is subject to Puerto Rico income tax on its income from all sources. As a Puerto Rico corporation, First BanCorp. is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. and USVI income tax purposes and, accordingly, is generally subject to U.S. and USVI income tax only on its income from sources within the U.S. and USVI or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in those jurisdictions. Any such tax paid in the U.S. and USVI is also creditable against the Corporation's Puerto Rico tax liability, subject to certain conditions and limitations.\nUnder the 2011 PR Code, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are generally not entitled to file consolidated tax returns. Thus, the Corporation is generally not entitled to utilize losses from one subsidiary to offset gains in another subsidiary. Accordingly, in order to obtain a tax benefit from an NOL, a particular subsidiary must be able to demonstrate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL carry-forward period. Pursuant to the 2011 PR Code, the carryforward period for NOLs incurred during taxable years that commenced after December 31, 2004 and ended before January 1, 2013 is 12 years; for NOLs incurred during taxable years commencing after December 31, 2012 the carryover period is 10 years. The 2011 PR Code allows an entity organized as a limited liability company to elect to become a non-taxable pass-through\u201d entity and utilize losses to offset income from other pass-through\u201d entities, subject to certain limitations, with the remaining net income passing-through to its partner entities. The 2011 PR Code also provides a dividend received deduction of 100% on dividends received from controlled\u201d subsidiaries subject to taxation in Puerto Rico and 85% on dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations.\nThe Corporation has maintained an effective tax rate lower than the maximum statutory rate, mainly by investing in government obligations and MBS exempt from U.S. and Puerto Rico income taxes and by doing business through an IBE unit of the Bank, and through the Bank's subsidiary, FirstBank Overseas Corporation, whose interest income and gain on sales is exempt from Puerto Rico income taxation. The IBE and FirstBank Overseas Corporation were created under the International Banking Entity Act of Puerto Rico, which provides for total Puerto Rico tax exemption on net income derived by IBEs operating in Puerto Rico on the specific activities identified in the IBE Act. An IBE that operates as a unit of a bank pays income taxes at the corporate standard rate to the extent that the IBE's net income exceeds 20% of the bank's total net taxable income.\nThe determination of deferred tax expense or benefit is based on changes in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that generate temporary differences. The carrying value of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset assumes that the Corporation will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income based on estimates and assumptions. If these estimates and related assumptions change, the Corporation may be required to record valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income\ntax expense in the consolidated statements of income. Management evaluates its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for a valuation allowance, if any. A valuation allowance is established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance from period to period are included in the Corporation's tax provision in the period of change.\nAfter completion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance analysis for the fourth quarter of 2018, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, it is more likely than not that FirstBank will generate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL carry-forward periods to realize $220.5 million of its deferred tax assets related to NOLs and, therefore, reversed $63.2 million of the valuation allowance. The decision to partially reverse the valuation allowance was reached after weighting all of the evidence and determining that the positive evidence out-weighted the negative evidence. The positive evidence considered by management in arriving at its decision to reverse part of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance includes factors such as: FirstBank's three-year cumulative income position; sustained periods of profitability following the hurricane events in 2017; and, forecasts of future profitability, under several potential scenarios, that support significant utilization of NOLs prior to their expiration ranging between the years 2021 through 2024. The negative evidence considered by management includes: uncertainties around the state of the Puerto Rico economy, including the effect of hurricane recovery funds together with Puerto Rico government debt renegotiation efforts and the ultimate sustainability of the approved Fiscal Plan; and consideration of the Corporation's still elevated levels of non-performing assets.\nThe authoritative accounting guidance prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of income tax uncertainties with respect to positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax returns. Under this guidance, income tax benefits are recognized and measured based on a two-step analysis: 1) a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized; and 2) the benefit is measured at the largest dollar amount of the position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized in accordance with this analysis and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an Unrecognized Tax Benefit ( UTB\u201d). The Corporation classifies interest and penalties, if any, related to UTBs as components of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation did not have any UTBs recorded on its books.\nRefer to Note 26 - Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to Income Taxes.\nClassification and Related Values of Investment Securities\nManagement determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase. Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when the Corporation has the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity ( HTM\u201d) securities are stated at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading when the Corporation has the intent to sell the securities in the near term. Debt classified as trading securities, if any, are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt securities not classified as HTM or trading are classified as available for sale ( AFS\u201d). AFS securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of deferred taxes in accumulated OCI (a component of stockholders' equity), and do not affect earnings until realized or are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. New accounting guidance with respect to the accounting for equity securities effective beginning on January 1, 2018 requires the measurement of equity investments at fair value through net income, with certain exceptions, thus, eliminating eligibility for the available-for-sale category. Investments in equity securities that do not have publicly or readily determinable fair values are classified as equity securities in the statement of financial condition and carried at the lower of cost or realizable value. The assessment of fair value applies to certain of the Corporation's assets and liabilities, including the investment portfolio. Fair values are volatile and are affected by factors such as market interest rates, the rates at which prepayments occur and discount rates.\nValuation of financial instruments\nThe measurement of fair value is fundamental to the Corporation's presentation of its financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation holds fixed income and equity securities, derivatives, investments, and other financial instruments at fair value. The Corporation holds its investments and liabilities mainly to manage liquidity needs and interest rate risks. A significant part of the Corporation's total assets is reflected at fair value on the Corporation's financial statements.\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nInvestment securities available for sale\nThe fair value of investment securities available for sale was the market value based on quoted market prices (as is the case with Treasury notes, and non-callable U.S. Agency debt securities), when available (Level 1), or, when available, market prices for identical or comparable assets (as is the case with MBS and callable U.S. agency debt) that are based on observable market parameters, including benchmark yields, reported trades, quotes from brokers or dealers, issuer spreads, bids, offers and reference data, including market research operations (Level 2). Observable prices in the market already consider the risk of nonperformance. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon discounted cash flow models that use unobservable inputs due to the limited market activity of the instrument, as is the case with certain private label MBS held by the Corporation (Level 3).\nPrivate label MBS are collateralized by fixed-rate mortgages on single-family residential properties in the U.S.; the interest rate on the securities is variable, tied to 3-month LIBOR and limited to the weighted-average coupon of the underlying collateral. The market valuation represents the estimated net cash flows over the projected life of the pool of underlying assets applying a discount rate that reflects market observed floating spreads over LIBOR, with a widening spread based on a nonrated security. The market valuation is derived from a model that utilizes relevant assumptions such as the prepayment rate, default rate, and loss severity on a loan level basis. The Corporation modeled the cash flow from the fixed-rate mortgage collateral using a static cash flow analysis according to collateral attributes of the underlying mortgage pool (i.e., loan term, current balance, note rate, rate adjustment type, rate adjustment frequency, rate caps, and others) in combination with prepayment forecasts based on historical portfolio performance. The variable cash flow of the security is modeled using the 3-month LIBOR forward curve. Loss assumptions were driven by the combination of default and loss severity estimates, using an asset-level risk assessment method taking into account loan credit characteristics (loan-to-value, state jurisdiction, delinquency, property type and pricing behavior, and other factors) to provide an estimate of default and loss severity.\nDerivative instruments\nThe fair value of most of the Corporation's derivative instruments is based on observable market parameters and takes into consideration the credit risk component of paying counterparties, when appropriate. On interest caps, only the seller's credit risk is considered. The caps were valued using a discounted cash flow approach based on the related LIBOR and swap rate for each cash flow.\nA credit spread is considered for those derivative instruments that are not secured. The cumulative mark-to-market effect of credit risk in the valuation of derivative instruments in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was immaterial.\nIncome Recognition on Loans and Impaired Loans\nLoans that the Corporation has the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for investment. The substantial majority of the Corporation's loans are classified as held for investment. Loans are stated at the principal outstanding balance, net of unearned interest, cumulative charge-offs, unamortized deferred origination fees and costs, and unamortized premiums and discounts. Fees collected and costs incurred in the origination of new loans are deferred and amortized using the interest method or a method that approximates the interest method over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest yield. Unearned interest on certain personal loans, auto loans and finance leases and discounts and premiums are recognized as income under a method that approximates the interest method. When a loan is paid-off or sold, any unamortized net deferred fee (cost) is credited (charged) to income. Credit card loans are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balance plus uncollected billed interest and fees net of amounts deemed uncollectible. PCI loans are reported net of any remaining purchase accounting adjustments. See Loans Acquired\u201d below for the accounting policy for PCI loans.\nNonaccrual and Past-Due Loans - Loans on which the recognition of interest income has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual. Loans are classified as nonaccrual when they are 90 days past due for interest and principal, with the exception of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (the FHA\u201d) or the Veterans Administration (the VA\u201d) and credit cards. It is the Corporation's policy to report delinquent mortgage loans insured by the FHA, or guaranteed by the VA or the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority, as loans past due 90 days and still accruing as opposed to nonaccrual loans since the principal repayment is insured. However, the Corporation discontinues the recognition of income for FHA/VA loans when such loans are over 15 months delinquent, taking into consideration the FHA interest curtailment process, and for loans guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority when such loans are over 90 days delinquent. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ( FFIEC\u201d), credit card loans are generally charged off in the period in which the account becomes 180 days past due. Credit card loans continue to accrue finance charges and fees until charged off at 180 days. Loans generally may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to when required by the policies described above when the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the borrower's financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any). When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any accrued but uncollected interest income is reversed\nand charged against interest income and amortization of any net deferred fees is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent it is received in cash. However, when there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal, all cash thereafter received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans (i.e., the cost recovery method). Generally, the Corporation returns a loan to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal becomes current under the terms of the loan agreement, or after a sustained period of repayment performance (6 months) and the loan is well secured and in the process of collection, and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected. PCI loans are not reported as nonaccrual as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date and the accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loans. Loans that are past due 30 days or more as to principal or interest are considered delinquent, with the exception of residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, and construction loans, which are considered past due when the borrower is in arrears on two or more monthly payments.\nImpaired Loans - A loan is considered impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due (including principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, or the loan has been modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring ( TDR\u201d). Loans with insignificant delays or insignificant shortfalls in the amounts of payments expected to be collected are not considered to be impaired. The Corporation evaluates individually for impairment those loans in the construction, commercial mortgage, and commercial and industrial portfolios of $1 million or more as well as any boat loan of $1 million or more. Although the authoritative accounting guidance for a specific impairment of a loan excludes large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment (e.g., mortgage and consumer loans), it specifically requires that loan modifications considered TDRs be analyzed under its provision. The Corporation also evaluates for impairment purposes certain residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit with high delinquency and loan to value levels. Held-for-sale loans are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.\nThe Corporation generally measures impairment and the related specific allowance for individually impaired loans based on the difference between the recorded investment of the loan and the present value of the loans' expected future cash flows, discounted at the effective original interest rate of the loan at the time of modification, or the loan's observable market price. If the loan is collateral dependent, the Corporation measures impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral, instead of discounted cash flows, regardless of whether foreclosure is probable. Loans are identified as collateral dependent if the repayment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral, through liquidation or operation of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is used to measure impairment on an impaired collateral-dependent loan and repayment or satisfaction of the loan is dependent on the sale of the collateral, the fair value of the collateral is adjusted to consider estimated costs to sell. If repayment is dependent only on the operation of the collateral, the fair value of the collateral is not adjusted for estimated costs to sell. If the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment, the Corporation recognizes impairment by either a direct write-down or establishing a specific allowance for the loan or by adjusting the specific allowance for the impaired loan. For an impaired loan that is collateral dependent, charge-offs are taken in the period in which the loan, or a portion of the loan, is deemed uncollectible, and any portion of the loan that is not charged off is adversely credit-risk rated at a level no worse than substandard.\nA restructuring of a loan constitutes a TDR if the creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. TDR loans typically result from the Corporation's loss mitigation activities and the modification of residential mortgage loans in accordance with guidelines similar to those of the U.S. government's Home Affordable Modification Program, and could include rate reductions to a rate that is below market on the loan, principal forgiveness, term extensions, payment forbearance, refinancing of any past-due amounts, including interest, escrow, and late charges and fees, and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Residential mortgage loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDR loans. PCI loans are not classified as TDR loans.\nTDR loans are classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans. Loans in accrual status may remain in accrual status when their contractual terms have been modified in a TDR if the loans had demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms is expected. Otherwise, loans on nonaccrual and restructured as a TDR will remain on nonaccrual status until the borrower has proven the ability to perform under the modified structure, generally for a minimum of six months, and there is evidence that such payments, can, and are likely to, continue as agreed. Refer to Note 8 - Loans Held for Investment, to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional qualitative and quantitative information about TDR loans.\nIn connection with commercial loan restructurings, the decision to maintain a loan that has been restructured on accrual status is based on a current, well-documented credit evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment under the modified terms. The credit evaluation reflects consideration of the borrower's future capacity to pay, which may include evaluation of cash flow projections, consideration of the adequacy of collateral to cover all principal and interest, and trends indicating improving profitability and collectability of receivables. This evaluation also includes an evaluation of the borrower's current willingness to pay, which may include a review of past payment history, an evaluation of the borrower's willingness to provide information on a timely basis, and consideration of offers from the borrower to provide additional collateral or guarantor support.\nThe evaluation of mortgage and consumer loans for restructurings includes an evaluation of the client's disposable income and credit report, the value of the property, the loan-to-value relationship, and certain other client-specific factors that have affected the borrower's ability to make timely principal and interest payments on the loan.\nThe Corporation removes loans from TDR classification, consistent with authoritative guidance that allows for a TDR to be removed from this classification in years following the modification, only when the following two circumstances are met:\n\u00b7 The loan is in compliance with the terms of the restructuring agreement and, therefore, is not considered impaired under the revised terms; and\n\u00b7 The loan yields a market interest rate at the time of the restructuring. In other words, the loan was restructured with an interest rate equal to or greater than what the Corporation would have been willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk.\nIf both of the conditions are met, the loan can be removed from the TDR classification in calendar years after the year in which the restructuring took place. However, the loan continues to be individually evaluated for impairment. Loans classified as TDRs, including loans in trial payment periods (trial modifications), are considered impaired loans.\nWith respect to the restructuring of a loan into two new loan notes, or loan splits, generally, Note A of a loan split is restructured under market terms, and Note B is fully charged off. If Note A is in compliance with the restructured terms in years following the restructuring, Note A will be removed from the TDR classification and will continue to be individually evaluated for impairment.\nA loan that had previously been modified in a TDR and is subsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.\nInterest income on impaired loans is recognized based on the Corporation's policy for recognizing interest on accrual and nonaccrual loans.\nLoans Acquired\nAll purchased loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and where it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Corporation will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments are considered PCI loans. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, credit scores, and revised loan terms. PCI loans have been aggregated into pools based on common risk characteristics. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. In accounting for PCI loans, the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference, which is neither accreted into income nor recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition, reflects estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the pool of loans. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is not recorded on the statements of financial condition, but is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the pool of loans, using the effective-yield method.\nSubsequent to acquisition, the Corporation continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the PCI loans using models that incorporate current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity, and prepayment speeds. Decreases in expected cash flows will generally result in an impairment charge to the provision for loan and lease losses and the establishment of an allowance for loan and lease losses. Increases in expected cash flows will generally result in a reduction in any allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition and an increase in the accretable yield. The adjusted accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the pool of loans.\nResolutions of loans may include sales of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or foreclosure of the collateral. The Corporation's policy is to remove an individual loan from a pool at its relative carrying amount. The carrying amount is defined as the loan's current contractually required payments receivable less its remaining nonaccretable difference and accretable yield, but excluding any post-acquisition loan loss allowance. To determine the carrying value, the Corporation performs a pro-rata allocation of the pool's total remaining nonaccretable difference and accretable yield to an individual loan in proportion to the loan's current contractually required payments receivable compared to the pool's total contractually required payments receivable. This removal method assumes that the amount received from resolution approximates pool performance expectations. The remaining accretable yield balance is unaffected and any material change in the remaining effective yield caused by this removal method is addressed by the Corporation's quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each pool. Modified PCI loans are not removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be deemed TDRs.\nBecause the initial fair value of PCI loans recorded at acquisition includes an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, the Corporation separately tracks and reports PCI loans and excludes these loans from its delinquency and nonaccrual loan statistics.\nFor acquired loans that are not deemed impaired at acquisition, subsequent to acquisition, the Corporation recognizes the difference between the initial fair value at acquisition and the undiscounted expected cash flows in interest income over the period in which substantially all of the inherent losses associated with the non-PCI loans at the acquisition date are estimated to occur. Thus, such loans are accounted for consistently with other originated loans, potentially being classified as nonaccrual or impaired, as well as being classified under the Corporation's standard practice and procedures. In addition, these loans are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses.\nLoans held for sale\nLoans that the Corporation intends to sell or that the Corporation does not have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held-for-sale loans. Loans held for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Generally, the loans held-for-sale portfolio consists of conforming residential mortgage loans that the Corporation intends to sell to GNMA and government-sponsored entities ( GSEs\u201d), such as the FNMA and FHLMC. Generally, residential mortgage loans held for sale are valued on an aggregate portfolio basis and the value is primarily derived from quotations based on the mortgage-backed securities market. The amount by which cost exceeds market value in the aggregate portfolio of loans held for sale, if any, is accounted for as a valuation allowance with changes therein included in the determination of net income and reported as part of mortgage banking activities in the consolidated statements of income. Loan costs and fees are deferred at origination and are recognized in income at the time of sale. The fair value of commercial and construction loans held for sale is primarily derived from external appraisals, or broker price opinions that the Corporation considered, with changes in the valuation allowance reported as part of other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\nIn certain circumstances, the Corporation transfers loans from/to held for sale or held for investment based on a change in strategy. If such a change in holding strategy is made, significant adjustments to the loans' carrying values may be necessary. Reclassifications of loans held for investment to held for sale are made at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer and establish a new cost basis upon transfer. Write-downs of loans transferred from held for investment to held for sale are recorded as charge-offs at the time of transfer. Subsequent changes in value below amortized cost are recorded through non-interest income. Reclassifications of loans held for sale to held for investment are made at fair value on the date of transfer. Any difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reclassified loan is recorded as an adjustment to non-interest income, prospectively, over the remaining life of the loan.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the excess of interest earned by First BanCorp. on its interest-earning assets over the interest incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities. First BanCorp.'s net interest income is subject to interest rate risk due to the repricing and maturity mismatch of the Corporation's assets and liabilities. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $525.4 million, compared to $491.6 million and $484.1 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. On a tax-equivalent basis and excluding the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $546.9 million compared to $508.0 million and $497.4 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following tables include a detailed analysis of net interest income. Part I presents average volumes (based on the average daily balance) and rates on an adjusted tax-equivalent basis and Part II presents, also on an adjusted tax-equivalent basis, the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-related assets and liabilities have affected the Corporation's net interest income. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes in (i) volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior period rates), and (ii) rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior period volumes). Rate-volume variances (changes in rate multiplied by changes in volume) have been allocated to the changes in volume and rate based upon their respective percentage of the combined totals.\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> The net interest income is computed on an adjusted tax-equivalent basis and excluding the change in the fair value of derivative instruments.

entities, generate interest that is exempt from income tax, principally in Puerto Rico. Also, interest and gains on sales of investments held by the Corporation's IBEs are tax-exempt under the Puerto Rico tax law (see Income Taxes\u201d below for additional information). To facilitate the comparison of all interest data related to these assets, the interest income has been converted to an adjusted taxable equivalent basis. The tax equivalent yield was estimated by dividing the interest rate spread on exempt assets by 1 less the Puerto Rico statutory tax rate (39.0%) and adding to it the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The computation considers the interest expense disallowance required by Puerto Rico tax law.\nThe presentation of net interest income excluding the effects of the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments ( valuations\u201d) provides additional information about the Corporation's net interest income and facilitates comparability and analysis. The changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments have no effect on interest due or interest earned on interest-bearing liabilities or interest-earning assets, respectively.\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> The following table reconciles net interest income in accordance with GAAP to net interest income, excluding valuations, and net interest income on an adjusted tax-equivalent basis for the last three years.

The $33.8 million increase in net interest income was primarily due to:\n\u00b7 A $17.2 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans, primarily related to the upward repricing of variable-rate commercial loans and higher yields on new loan originations.\n\u00b7 A $9.1 million increase in interest income on investment securities, primarily due to the gradual reinvestment of liquidity, obtained from the growth in non-interest bearing deposits and proceeds from maturing debt securities into higher-yielding U.S. agencies debt securities and MBS. The average balance of investment securities for 2018 increased by $181.4 million compared to 2017.\n\u00b7 A $7.5 million increase in interest income on consumer loans, mainly due to a $77.8 million increase in the average balance of this portfolio, primarily auto loans and finance leases. The variance includes a $1.0 million increase in late payment fees as the Corporation did not assess late charges during the fourth quarter of 2017 to customers affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria that qualified for the three-month payment deferral program established by the Corporation after the hurricanes.\n\u00b7 A $6.5 million increase in interest income from interest-bearing cash balances due to both an increase of $207.3 million in the average balance, primarily deposits maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and increases in the Federal Funds Target Rate. A growth in non-interest bearing deposits provided higher liquidity levels in 2018. The Federal Funds target rate has increased four times since the end of 2017 from a range of 1.25% - 1.50% to its current range of 2.25% - 2.50%.\nPartially offset by:\n\u00b7 A $3.7 million decrease in interest income on residential mortgage loans, primarily related to an $81.2 million decline in the average balance of this portfolio. Approximately 71% of the residential mortgage loan originations in Puerto Rico consisted of conforming loan originations sold in the secondary market to GNMA and GSEs.\n\u00b7 A $2.7 million increase in total interest expense, driven by: (i) a $5.8 million increase in interest expense on non-brokered interest-bearing deposits, driven by the effect of higher market interest rates on the cost of retail CDs and commercial money market accounts tied to variable short-term interest rates; (ii) a $2.4 million increase in interest expense on FHLB advances reflecting increased use of long-term advances to fund its lending and investment activities; and (iii) a $0.7 million increase in interest expense related to the upward repricing of floating-rate junior subordinated debentures. The aforementioned increases were partially offset by a $4.7 million decrease in interest expense on brokered CDs, primarily related to a $480.3 million decrease in the average balance that offset higher costs of new issuances, and a $1.5 million decrease in interest expense on repurchase agreements related to a $134.0 million decrease in the average balance. During 2018, the Corporation repaid $657.9 million of maturing brokered CDs with an all-in cost of 1.45% and new issuances amounted to $62.0 million with an all-in cost of 2.95%.\nThe net interest margin increased by 19 basis points to 4.55% for 2018, compared to 4.36% for 2017, driven by the aforementioned upward repricing of commercial and construction loans, an improved funding mix, driven by the increase in the proportion of interest-earning assets funded by the growth in non-interest bearing deposits, and the gradual reinvestment of liquidity in higher-yielding securities.\nOn an adjusted tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $38.9 million to $546.9 million, when compared to 2017. In addition to the facts discussed above, the tax equivalent adjustment increased by $5.1 million, primarily related to the increase in interest income from tax-exempt U.S. agencies debt and MBS held by the IBE subsidiary First Bank Overseas.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $491.6 million, an increase of $7.4 million, when compared to $484.1 million in 2016. The $7.4 million increase in net interest income was primarily due to:\n\u00b7 A $12.5 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans, primarily related to both the upward repricing of variable-rate commercial loans and the growth of the performing commercial portfolios, primarily in the Florida region.\n\u00b7 A $4.3 million decrease in interest expense, driven by: (i) a $9.3 million decrease in interest expense on repurchase agreements, primarily reflecting the full-year effect of the repayments of repurchase agreements totaling $400 million that matured during the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and carried an average cost of 3.35%; and (ii) a $ 2.8 million decrease in interest expense on brokered CDs, primarily related to a $509.0 million decrease in the average volume that offset higher costs on new issuances. During 2017, the Corporation repaid $803.6 million of maturing brokered CDs with an all-in cost of 1.12% and new issuances amounted to $514.0 million with an all-in cost of 1.70%.\nThe aforementioned variances were partially offset by: (i) a $5.2 million increase in interest expense on FHLB advances, reflecting the increases in the proportion of long-term and short-term FHLB advances used to fund lending activities and the effect of higher market interest rates; (ii) an increase of $2.0 million in interest expense on non-brokered interest-bearing deposits reflecting, among other things, a higher proportion of time deposits to total deposits, the renewal of retail CDs at longer terms, and higher market interest rates in 2017; and (iii) an increase of $0.6 million in interest expense related to the upward repricing of floating-rate junior subordinated debentures.\n\u00b7 A $1.2 million increase in interest income from deposits maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank due to increases in the Federal Funds' target rate in 2017 and late in 2016.\n\u00b7 A $0.2 million increase in interest income on investment securities, driven by a $2.1 million increase in interest income on U.S. agency MBS, primarily due to a lower premium amortization expense resulting from lower prepayment rates in 2017, and a $0.7 million increase in FHLB dividend income. These variances were partially offset by an adverse impact of approximately $1.7 million related to the aforementioned bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority for which recognition of interest income was discontinued during the third quarter of 2016, and the effect in 2016 of discount accretions totaling $0.8 million related to $72.4 million of U.S. agencies debt securities called prior to maturity.\nPartially offset by:\n\u00b7 A $5.6 million decrease in interest income on consumer loans and finance leases, mainly attributable to the decrease of $33.5 million in the average balance of this portfolio, primarily auto loans, and, to a lesser extent, the effect of a $1.4 million decrease in late payment fees, as the Corporation did not assess late charges during the fourth quarter of 2017 to customers affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria that qualified for the three-month payment deferral program established by the Corporation after the hurricanes.\n\u00b7 A $5.3 million decrease in interest income on residential mortgage loans reflecting the effect of both a higher level of inflows of residential mortgage loans to non-performing status and a $41.8 million decrease in the average balance of this portfolio.\nThe net interest margin increased by 22 basis points to 4.36% for 2017, compared to 4.14% for 2016, driven by the aforementioned upward repricing of commercial and construction loans, the decrease in U.S. agency MBS premium amortization expense, and the benefit of the overall lower level of liquidity that reflects the effect of cash balances used for the repayment of high-cost repurchase agreements that matured during the second half of 2016.\nOn an adjusted tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $10.6 million to $508.0 million, when compared to 2016. In addition to the facts discussed above, the tax equivalent adjustment increased by $3.2 million during 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily in connection with the increase in interest income on U.S. agencies MBS held by the IBE subsidiary First Bank Overseas and higher income on tax-exempt commercial loans.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe provision for loan and lease losses is charged to earnings to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that the Corporation considers adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is also based upon a number of additional factors, including trends in charge-offs and delinquencies, current economic conditions, the fair value of the underlying collateral and the financial condition of the borrowers, and, as such, includes amounts based on judgments and estimates made by the Corporation. Important factors that influence this judgment are re-evaluated quarterly to respond to changing conditions.\nAs described in Note 2 - Effects of Natural Disasters, in the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, two strong hurricanes affected the Corporation's service areas during September 2017. These hurricanes caused widespread property damage, flooding, power outages, and water and communication service interruptions, and severely disrupted normal economic activity in the affected areas. During the third quarter of 2017, the Corporation recorded a $66.5 million charge to the provision related to the establishment of qualitative reserves associated with the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Initially, these qualitative reserves were derived from a regression modeling approach in which relationships between portfolio-level loss rates and key economic indicators were determined based on historical behavior. Accordingly, the qualitative reserves were initially determined in 2017 based on the estimated effect that the hurricanes could have on employment levels and economic activity in the Corporation's service areas, and the time that it could take for the affected regions to return to a more normalized operating environment.\nDuring 2018, the Corporation performed additional procedures to evaluate the adequacy of the qualitative reserve, including the consideration of updated payment patterns and probability of default credit risk analyses applied to consumer loan borrowers subject to payment deferral programs that expired early in 2018. For the determination of the hurricane-related qualitative reserve for residential mortgage loans as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation stressed the loss factors derived from its base methodology by incorporating assumptions of deterioration in the current housing price index and higher loan modification levels. Although the foreclosure moratoriums extended by the FHA to hurricane-affected individuals ended on September 15, 2018, there are likely to be additional delays in foreclosures actions due to court-related backlogs. For the determination of the hurricane-related qualitative reserve for commercial and construction loans not individually reviewed as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation segregated the portfolio based on delinquency levels and stressed the general reserve loss factors applicable to 30-89 days past due loans to reflect higher default probabilities\nFor large commercial and construction loan relationships, loan officers performed individual reviews of the effect of the hurricanes on these borrowers' sources of repayment. These large relationships were analyzed and divided into three hurricane-affected categories (i.e. Low, Medium, and High). This stratification was used to stressed the general reserve loss factors applicable to these loans to reflect higher default probabilities not reflected in the historical data.\nRelationship officers have continued to closely monitor the performance of hurricane-affected commercial loan customers during 2018. Information provided by these commercial loan officers, including information derived from regularly scheduled annual reviews, and statistics on the performance of consumer and residential credits, were factored into the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses as of December 31, 2018. Although the identification and evaluation of hurricane-affected credits has been completed, management's assessment of the hurricanes' effect is still subject to uncertainties, both those specific to certain individual customers, such as the resolution of insurance claims, and those applicable to the overall economic prospects of the hurricane-affected areas as a whole.\nAs a result of the aforementioned analyses, the Corporation recorded in 2018 a net loan loss reserve release of $16.9 million in connection with revised estimates of the effects of the hurricanes, compared to charges to the provision of $71.3 million recorded in 2017. In addition to the above-mentioned updated assessments of financial performance and repayment prospects of certain individually-assessed commercial credits and updated payment patterns and probability of default credit risk analyses applied to consumer borrowers that were subject to payment deferral programs, the reserve releases in 2018 reflect the effect of payments received during the year that reduced the balance of consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios outstanding on the dates of the hurricanes. In addition, during 2018, consumer loan charge-offs totaling $10.9 million were taken against previously-established hurricane-related qualitative reserves. These charge-offs were directly linked to the performance of consumer borrowers that were subject to payment deferral programs. As of December 31, 2018, the hurricane-related qualitative reserves amounted to $19.2 million (2017 - $55.6 million). On a portfolio basis, the hurricane-related qualitative reserve was composed of: (i) an $8.8 million hurricane-related qualitative reserve for residential mortgage loans (2017 - $9.2 million); (ii) a $7.2 million hurricane-related qualitative reserve for commercial and construction loans (2017 - $21.4 million); and (iii) a $3.2 million hurricane-related qualitative reserve for consumer loans (2017 - $25.0 million). As the Corporation acquires additional information on overall economic prospects in the storm-affected areas and the performance of consumer credits that had been under payment deferral programs and obtains further assessments of individual borrowers, the loss estimate will be revised as needed.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding the aforementioned effects of reserve releases and charges associated with the hurricane-related qualitative reserves, the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses was $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $73.0 million and $86.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n2018 compared to 2017\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effects of reserve releases and charges associated with the hurricane-related qualitative reserves, the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses of $76.2 million for 2018 increased by $3.2 million as compared to the adjusted provision of $73.0 million for 2017. The $3.2 million increase in the adjusted provision was driven by:\n\u00b7 A $26.2 million increase in the adjusted provision for commercial and construction loans, primarily reflecting charges of $22.3 million recorded in 2018 related to developments in problem loans resolution strategies, including a $15.7 million charge to the provision related to fair value write-downs on $74.4 million of nonaccrual loans transferred to held for sale during 2018. During 2018, the Corporation transferred to held for sale several nonaccrual commercial and construction loans. The aggregate recorded investment in these loans of $96.6 million was written down to $74.4 million, which resulted in net charge-offs of $22.2 million, of which $6.5 million was taken against previously-established reserves for loan losses, resulting in the $15.7 million charge to the provision in 2018. Approximately $57.2 million of the $74.4 million nonaccrual loans transferred to held for held during 2018, were sold prior to the end of the year. In addition, the higher adjusted provision for commercial and construction loans reflects the effect of charges to the provision totaling $13.7 million associated with the downgrade in the credit risk classification of two large commercial relationships in 2018, partially offset by a $3.3 million increase in loan loss recoveries and a $1.6 million decrease related to the refinements to both the determination of historical loss rates and the measurement of qualitative factors used in the estimation process of the general reserve for commercial loans, as further discussed below.\nPartially offset by:\n\u00b7 A $22.6 million decrease in the adjusted provision for residential loans, primarily reflecting declines in charge-offs, nonaccrual, and delinquent loan levels, the overall decrease in the size of this portfolio, and the effect in 2017 of adjustments to the loss severity estimates used in the calculation of the general reserve.\n\u00b7 A $0.4 million decrease in the adjusted provision for consumer loans, primarily reflecting lower charge-off levels (excluding the above-mentioned charge-offs of $10.9 million taken against previously-established hurricane qualitative reserves), partially offset by the increase in size of the auto and finance leases portfolio, the effect of refinements discussed below in the measurement of qualitative factors used in the determination of the general reserve of consumer loans implemented in the second quarter of 2018.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, and as part of the Corporation's plan to remediate a material weakness identified in the preparation of financial statements included in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, an independent third party engaged by the Corporation completed its assessment of the commercial allowance for loan losses framework and the appropriateness of assumptions used in the analysis. The Corporation reviewed the assessment and decided to implement certain enhancements, which include, among others, a revised procedure whereby historical loss rates for each commercial loan regulatory-based credit risk category (i.e., pass, special mention, substandard, and doubtful) are now calculated using the historical charge-offs and portfolio balances over their average loss emergence period (the raw loss rate\u201d) for each credit risk classification. However, when not enough loss experience is observed in a particular risk-rated category and the calculation results in a loss rate for such risk-rated category that is lower than the loss rate of a less severe risk-rated category, the Corporation now uses the loss rate of such less severe category.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the historical losses and portfolio balances of special mention loans were allocated to pass or substandard categories based on the historical proportion of loans in this risk category that ultimately cured or resulted in being uncollectible.\nIn addition, during the second quarter of 2018, the Corporation implemented refinements to the measurement of qualitative factors in the estimation process of the allowance for loan losses for commercial and consumer loans, primarily consisting of the incorporation of a basis point adjustment derived from the difference between the average raw loss rate and the highest loss rates observed during a look-back period that management determined was appropriate to use for each region to identify any relevant effect during an economic cycle.\nAlthough the net effect of these refinements was immaterial to the total provision expense, on a portfolio basis these enhancements resulted in a $1.6 million decrease in the provision for commercial and construction loans, offset by a $1.6 million increase in the provision for consumer loans in the second quarter of 2018.\nSee Basis of Presentation\u201d below for a reconciliation of the GAAP provision for loan and lease losses to the non-GAAP provision for loan and lease losses excluding the effect of the hurricane-related qualitative reserves mentioned above. Also see Risk\nManagement - Credit Risk Management\u201d below for additional information concerning the Corporation's loan portfolio exposure in the geographic areas where the Corporation does business.\n2017 compared to 2016\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of the above mentioned charges to the hurricane-related qualitative reserves, the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses of $73.0 million for 2017 decreased by $13.7 million as compared to the provision of $86.7 million for 2016. The $13.7 million decrease in the adjusted provision was driven by:\n\u00b7 A $22.6 million decrease in the adjusted provision for commercial and construction loans, primarily reflecting lower specific reserve requirements for impaired loans, a $2.9 million increase in loan loss recoveries, including a $4.2 million recovery recorded on a previously charged-off commercial and industrial loan in Puerto Rico, and the effect in 2016 of a $1.8 million charge associated with the sale of a $16.3 million pool of non-performing assets.\n\u00b7 A $2.8 million decrease in the adjusted provision for consumer loans and finance leases, primarily related to lower delinquency levels for personal and small loans. The three-month hurricane-related deferred repayment arrangements provided to consumer borrowers current in their payments, or no more than two payments in arrears as of the date of the respective hurricanes, affected the delinquency levels of these portfolios during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nPartially offset by:\n\u00b7 An $11.1 million increase in the adjusted provision for residential mortgage loans, primarily related to a higher level of nonaccrual residential mortgage loans, increased specific reserves for residential mortgage TDR loans, and higher loss severity estimates in 2017, including adjustments to liquidation cost assumptions.\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> Non-Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nThe following table presents the composition of non-interest income:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,965\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage banking activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,435\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,473\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Broker-dealer income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,111\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income before net (loss) gain on investments securities, and gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\non early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,773\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (loss) gain on sale of investments securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,104\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from recovery of investments previously written off\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,547\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> OTTI on debt securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,231)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,687)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (loss) gain on investments securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (84)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,860)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,217\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,954\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-interest income primarily consists of income from service charges on deposit accounts, commissions derived from various banking, securities and insurance activities, gains and losses on mortgage banking activities, interchange and other fees related to debit and credit cards, and net gains and losses on investments and impairments.\nService charges on deposit accounts include monthly fees, overdraft fees, and other fees on deposit accounts as well as corporate cash management fees.\nIncome from mortgage banking activities includes gains on sales and securitization of loans, revenues earned for administering residential mortgage loans originated by the Corporation and subsequently sold with servicing retained, and unrealized gains and losses on forward contracts used to hedge the Corporation's securitization pipeline. In addition, lower-of-cost-or-market valuation adjustments to the Corporation's residential mortgage loans held-for-sale portfolio and servicing rights portfolio, if any, are recorded as part of mortgage banking activities.\nInsurance income consists of insurance commissions earned by the Corporation's subsidiary, FirstBank Insurance Agency, Inc.\nBroker-dealer income consists of commissions earned from the activities used to be conducted by the Corporation's broker-dealer subsidiary, FirstBank Puerto Rico Securities. As noted above, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved in 2018 a resolution to dissolve FirstBank Securities and its license as brokered-dealer was terminated effective September 30, 2018.\nThe other operating income category is composed of miscellaneous fees such as debit, credit card and point of sale ( POS\u201d) interchange fees, as well as contractual shared revenues from merchant contracts sold in 2015.\nThe net gain (loss) on investment securities reflects gains or losses as a result of sales that are consistent with the Corporation's investment policies as well as OTTI charges on the Corporation's investment portfolio.\nThe gain on early extinguishment of debt is related to the repurchase and cancellation of $23.8 million and $7.3 million in trust-preferred securities of FBP Statutory Trust I in the first quarter of 2018 and third quarter of 2017, respectively, and $10 million in trust-preferred securities of FBP Statutory Trust II in the first quarter of 2016. The Corporation repurchased and cancelled the repurchased trust-preferred securities, which resulted in a commensurate reduction in the related Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures. The Corporation's purchase price equated to 90%, 81% and 70% of the par value of the trust-preferred securities repurchased in the first quarter of 2018, the third quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2016, respectively. The 10% discount for the trust-preferred securities repurchased in the first quarter of 2018 resulted in a gain of $2.3 million, the 19% discount for the trust-preferred securities repurchased in the third quarter of 2017, plus accrued interest, resulted in a gain of $1.4 million and the 30% discount for the trust-preferred securities repurchased in the first quarter of 2016, plus accrued interest, resulted in a gain of $4.2 million. These gains are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as a Gain on early extinguishment of debt.\u201d As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation still has Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures outstanding in the aggregate amount of $184.2 million.\n2018 compared to\nNon-interest income for 2018 amounted to $82.3 million, compared to $62.4 million for 2017. The $19.9 million increase in non-interest income was primarily due to:\n\u00b7 The effect in 2017 of the $12.2 million OTTI charge on three Puerto Rico Government debt securities held by the Corporation as part of its available-for-sale securities portfolio, specifically bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority. As described above, these bonds were sold in the second quarter of 2017.\n\u00b7 A $3.9 million increase in Other operating income\u201d in the table above, primarily reflecting: (i) a $3.6 million increase in transaction fee income from ATM, POS, credit and debit card interchange fees, and merchant-related transactions; (ii) a $1.2 million increase in gain from sales of fixed assets, primarily assets of relocated or closed banking branches in Florida and Puerto Rico; (iii) the $0.5 million gain from hurricane-related insurance proceeds recorded in 2018; (iv) a $0.4 million increase in fee income from wire transfer activity; and (v) a $0.3 million increase in certain non-deferrable loans fees such as unused commitment fees. These variances were partially offset by a $2.7 million net loss from sales of nonaccrual commercial and construction loans held for sale in 2018.\n\u00b7 A $3.7 million increase in revenues from mortgage banking activities, driven by a net variance of $2.9 million related to adjustments recorded against the valuation allowance of mortgage servicing rights. During 2018, the valuation allowance of mortgage servicing rights was reduced by $1.3 million compared to temporary impairments on servicing rights of $1.6 million recorded in 2017. In addition, mortgage servicing fees increased by $1.1 million. These variances were partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in net gain on sales of residential mortgage loans. Total loans sold in the secondary market to U.S. government-sponsored entities amounted to $338.1 million with a related net gain of $9.7 million, including realized gains of $0.9 million on To-Be-Announced MBS ( TBA\u201d) hedges entered and settled during 2018,\ncompared to total loans sold in the secondary market of $322.5 million with a related net gain of $9.8 million, net of realized losses on TBA hedges of $0.6 million, for 2017. The total amount of loans sold in the secondary market in 2018 included $9.8 million of seasoned residential mortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae that resulted in a gain of $0.2 million.\n\u00b7 A $0.9 million increase in gains on early extinguishment of debt. During the first quarter of 2018, the Corporation recorded a $2.3 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $23.8 million in trust-preferred securities, compared to a $1.4 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $7.3 million in trust preferred securities recorded in the third quarter of 2017.\nPartially offset by:\n\u00b7 A $0.6 million decrease in service charges on deposits, primarily related to a decrease in overdraft and returned items transactions.\n2017 compared to\nNon-interest income for 2017 amounted to $62.4 million, compared to $88.0 million for 2016. The $25.6 million decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to:\n\u00b7 A $6.9 million decrease in revenues from mortgage banking activities driven by lower conforming loan origination and sales volume in the secondary market associated with both the drop in business activity in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands after the hurricanes and higher market interest rates in 2017. Total loans sold in the secondary market to U.S. government-sponsored entities amounted to $322.5 million with a related gain of $9.8 million, net of TBA hedge losses of $0.6 million, for 2017, compared to $482.6 million with a related gain of $15.2 million, including TBA hedge gains of $0.5 million, for 2016. In addition, temporary impairments on servicing rights increased by $1.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016.\n\u00b7 The effect in 2016 of a $6.1 million gain on sales of $198.7 million of U.S. agency MBS.\n\u00b7 A $5.9 million increase in OTTI charges on bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority. During the first quarter of 2017, the Corporation recorded a $12.2 million OTTI charge on the above-mentioned bonds that were subsequently sold in the second quarter of 2017. The OTTI charge recorded in 2017 was the fourth OTTI charge on these securities recorded since June 30, 2015, as OTTI charges of $6.3 million, $12.9 million and $3.0 million were booked in the first quarter of 2016, and the second and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively.\n\u00b7 A $2.9 million decrease in gains associated with repurchases and cancellations of trust-preferred securities. During the third quarter of 2017, the Corporation recorded a $1.4 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $7.3 million of trust-preferred securities, compared to a $4.2 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $10 million of trust-preferred securities in the first quarter of 2016.\n\u00b7 The effect in 2016 of a $1.5 million gain from the recovery of a residual CMO previously written off that was associated with the liquidation of the related trust in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\u00b7 The effect in 2016 of brokerage and insurance commissions of $1.8 million, primarily related to the sale of large fixed annuities contracts.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> Non-Interest Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The following table presents the components of non-interest expenses:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employees' compensation and benefits\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 151,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 151,493\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,159\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FDIC deposit insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,055\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Taxes, other than income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,139\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCollections, appraisals and other credit-related fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,890\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOutsourcing technology services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,264\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,983\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit and debit card processing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,635\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business promotion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,419\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,759\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss on OREO and OREO operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,533\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,751\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 357,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 347,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 355,080\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ncompared to 2017\nNon-interest expenses increased by $10.1 million to $357.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $347.7 million for 2017. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u00b7 A $7.6 million increase in employees' compensation and benefit expenses, primarily due to salary merit increases and adjustments related to the Corporation's annual salary review process, higher headcount and recruiting expenses, and the effect in 2017 of expected insurance recoveries of approximately $1.4 million in connection with payroll costs incurred when Hurricanes Irma and Maria precluded employees from working during 2017. In addition, there was a $0.6 million increase related to a higher matching contribution to the employees' retirement plans.\n\u00b7 A $3.5 million increase in losses from OREO operations, reflecting a $2.1 million increase in adverse fair value adjustments to the value of OREO properties and a $1.3 million increase in OREO operating expenses, which included insurance, taxes and maintenance fees, and a $0.1 million increase related to lower income recognized from rental payments associated with income-producing commercial properties.\n\u00b7 A $2.3 million increase in business promotion expenses, primarily reflecting a $1.9 million increase related to advertising, marketing, public relations, promotions and sponsorship activities and a $0.9 million increase in the estimated cost of the credit card rewards program, partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in expenses associated with relief efforts and assistance to employees and communities after the passage of Hurricanes Irma and Maria during 2017.\n\u00b7 A $2.3 million increase in credit and debit card processing expenses, mainly related to higher transaction volumes.\n\u00b7 A $1.3 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses, primarily due to hurricane-related expenses incurred in 2018 associated with repairs and security matters and the effect in 2017 of expected insurance recoveries for rental costs of $0.4 million that the Corporation incurred when Hurricanes Irma and Maria precluded the utilization of certain facilities during 2017.\nPartially offset by:\n\u00b7 A $4.8 million decrease in the FDIC insurance premium expense reflecting, among other things, the effect of improved earnings trends, reductions in brokered CDs, and higher liquidity levels tied to the growth in non-interest-bearing deposits.\n\u00b7 A $2.4 million decrease in total professional service fees, primarily reflecting a $1.7 million decrease in attorneys' collection, appraisals and credit-related fees, and a $0.8 million decrease in external audit-related fees.\nNon-interest expenses decreased by $7.4 million to $347.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $355.1 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the following:\n\u00b7 A $6.3 million decrease in the FDIC insurance premium expense, mainly related to the effect of reductions in brokered deposits and average assets, a strengthened capital position, and improved liquidity metrics.\n\u00b7 A $2.1 million decrease in the provision for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, included as part of Other\u201d in the table above, reflecting lower unused balances on adversely classified commercial lines of credit.\n\u00b7 A $0.8 million decrease in write-downs, loss on sales and expenses related to non-real estate repossessed assets, included as part of Other\u201d in the table above.\n\u00b7 A $0.6 million decrease in communications-related matters, primarily reductions in telephone and postage expenses.\n\u00b7 A $0.6 million decrease in taxes, other than income taxes, primarily related to reductions in the sales and use taxes and municipal license taxes in Puerto Rico.\n\u00b7 A $0.5 million decrease in losses from OREO operations, primarily reflecting a $1.8 million decrease in write-downs to the value of OREO properties, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in rental income from commercial OREO income-producing properties.\n\u00b7 A $0.5 million decrease in the amortization of intangible assets, included as part of Other\u201d in the table above.\n\u00b7 A $0.4 million decrease in credit and debit card processing expenses, primarily associated with a lower volume of transactions affected by the drop in business activity after the hurricanes in 2017.\nPartially offset by:\n\u00b7 A $1.8 million increase in total professional service fees, primarily reflecting higher consulting fees related to the implementation of new technology systems and higher outsourcing fees related to network services, partially offset by lower appraisals and collection fees related to troubled loan resolution efforts.\n\u00b7 A $1.5 million increase in occupancy and equipment costs, primarily due to higher electricity, property taxes and rental expenses. The increase was partially offset by the approximately $0.4 million of expected insurance recoveries for rental costs that the Corporation incurred when Hurricanes Irma and Maria precluded the utilization of certain facilities during 2017.\n\u00b7 A $1.1 million increase in business promotion expenses, reflecting the effect in 2016 of a $2.7 million adjustment recorded to reduce the credit card rewards program liability due to the expiration of reward points earned by customers up to September 2013 (the conversion date of the credit card portfolio acquired from FIA in May 2012) and costs incurred in 2017 of approximately $1.0 million related to hurricane relief efforts and assistance to employees, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease associated with lower advertising and marketing-related activities.\n\u00b7 A $0.4 million increase in employees' compensation and benefits, mainly due to salary merit increases and higher stock-based compensation costs as well as costs of $1.2 million recorded in 2017 associated with a cash transition award paid to certain senior officers under the new executive compensation program that became effective on July 1, 2017. These variances were partially offset by the expected insurance recoveries of approximately $1.4 million in connection with payroll costs incurred when Hurricanes Irma and Maria precluded employees from working during 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense includes Puerto Rico and USVI income taxes as well as applicable U.S. federal and state taxes. The Corporation is subject to Puerto Rico income tax on its income from all sources. As a Puerto Rico corporation, First BanCorp. is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. and USVI income tax purposes and, accordingly, is generally subject to U.S. and USVI income tax only on its income from sources within the U.S. and USVI or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in those jurisdictions. Any such tax paid in the U.S. and USVI is also creditable against the Corporation's Puerto Rico tax liability, subject to certain conditions and limitations.\nUnder the 2011 PR Code, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are generally not entitled to file consolidated tax returns and, thus, the Corporation is generally not entitled to utilize losses from one subsidiary to offset gains in another subsidiary. Accordingly, in order to obtain a tax benefit from an NOL, a particular subsidiary must be able to demonstrate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL carry-forward period. Pursuant to the 2011 PR Code, the carryforward period for NOLs incurred during taxable years that commenced after December 31, 2004 and ended before January 1, 2013 is 12 years; for NOLs incurred during taxable years commencing after December 31, 2012 the carryover period is 10 years. The 2011 PR Code allows an entity organized as a limited liability company to elect to become a non-taxable pass-through\u201d entity and utilize losses to offset income from other pass-through\u201d entities, subject to certain limitations, with the remaining net income passing-through to its partner entities. The 2011 PR Code also provides a dividend received deduction of 100% on dividends received from controlled\u201d subsidiaries subject to taxation in Puerto Rico and 85% on dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations.\nOn March 1, 2017, the Corporation completed the applicable regulatory filings to change the tax status of its subsidiary, First Federal Finance Corp., from a taxable corporation to a non-taxable pass-through\u201d entity. This election has allowed the Corporation to realize tax benefits of its deferred tax assets associated with pass-through ordinary net operating losses available at the banking subsidiary, FirstBank, which were subject to a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016, against now pass-through ordinary income from this profitable subsidiary.\nOn March 1, 2017, the Corporation also completed the applicable regulatory filings to change the tax status of its subsidiary, FirstBank Insurance, from a taxable corporation to a non-taxable pass-through\u201d entity. This election has allowed the Corporation to offset pass-through income earned by FirstBank Insurance with net operating losses available at the Holding Company level.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States President signed H.R.1, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, effective January 1, 2018, which includes an overhaul of individual, business and international taxes and has affected our branch operations in the U.S. and the USVI. The bill includes measures reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, repealing of the corporate alternative minimum tax regime, changing business deductions and NOLs, and imposing a 15.5% tax on mandatory repatriation of liquid assets, a 10% tax on base erosion payments, and a minimum 10.5% tax on inclusion of global intangible low-tax income by U.S. shareholders, among other significant changes. The main provisions affecting our operations in the U.S. and the USVI for the year 2018 include: the change in the tax rate to 21%, the limitation on the amount certain financial institutions, including the Bank, may deduct for premiums paid to the FDIC, and changes in permanent differences, such as meals and entertainment deductions. Other significant provisions, such as the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, do not affect the Corporation's U.S. and USVI branch operations since these operations' receipts do not exceed the annual threshold of U.S. effectively connected gross receipts.\nOn December 10, 2018, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law Act 257 to amend some of the provisions of the of 2011PR Code. Act 257 introduces various changes to the current income tax regime in the case of individuals and corporations, and the sales and use taxes that are effective on January 1, 2019, including, among others, (i) a reduction in the Puerto Rico maximum corporate tax rate from 39% to 37.5%; (ii) an increase in the net operating and capital losses usage limitation from 80% to 90%; (iii) amendments to the provisions related to pass-through\u201d entities that provide that corporations that own 50% or more of a partnership will not be able to claim a current or carryover non partnership NOL deduction against a partnership distributable share, adversely impacting the above described tax action taken in 2017 for FirstBank Insurance; and (iv) other limitations on certain deductions, such as meals and entertainment deductions. The PROMESA oversight board accepted the required certification submitted by the Legislature of Puerto Rico (the Compliance Certification\u201d) acknowledging that Act 257 is not significantly inconsistent with the Commonwealth's Fiscal Plan as it applies to Articles 1 through 131 and 164-165. However, the PROMESA oversight board expressed concerns regarding certain provisions of Act 257, specifically Articles 132 through 163, regarding the video lottery terminals that operate outside casinos in Puerto Rico. It is not yet determined whether Act 257 will be further amended to accommodate any mandate from the PROMESA oversight board.\nThe Corporation has maintained an effective tax rate lower than the maximum statutory rate mainly by investing in government obligations and MBS exempt from U.S. and Puerto Rico income taxes and by doing business through an IBE unit of the Bank, and through the Bank's subsidiary, FirstBank Overseas Corporation, whose interest income and gain on sales is exempt from Puerto Rico income taxation. The IBE and FirstBank Overseas Corporation were created under the International Banking Entity Act of Puerto Rico, which provides for total Puerto Rico tax exemption on net income derived by IBEs operating in Puerto Rico on the specific\nactivities identified in the IBE Act. An IBE that operates as a unit of a bank pays income taxes at the corporate standard rate to the extent that the IBE's net income exceeds 20% of the bank's total net taxable income.\nFor additional information relating to income taxes, see Note 26 - Income Taxes,\u201d of the Corporation's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, including the reconciliation of the statutory to the effective income tax rate for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n2018 compared to\nFor 2018, the Corporation recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $11.0 million compared to an income tax benefit of $5.0 million for 2017. The income tax benefit for 2018 reflects, among others, the effect of a $63.2 million partial reversal of FirstBank's deferred tax asset valuation allowance recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018 and a $24.7 million deferred tax asset valuation release from the utilization and disallowance of NOLs that were partially or fully reserved; partially offset by a one-time charge to the income tax expense of $9.9 million related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets, which is net of the $5.6 million related impact in the valuation allowance, as result of the reduction in corporate tax rates as per Act 257. The income tax benefit for 2017 was mostly attributable to the tax benefit related to hurricane-related charges and to a $13.2 million tax benefit resulting from the above discussed change in tax status of certain subsidiaries from taxable corporations to limited liability companies that have elected to be treated as partnerships for income tax purposes in Puerto Rico.\nAs a result of the partial reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets in connection with the enactment of Act 257, the Corporation's net deferred tax assets amounted to $319.9 million as of December 31, 2018, net of a valuation allowance of $100.7 million, compared to net deferred tax assets of $294.8 million, net of a valuation allowance of $191.2 million as of December 31, 2017. After completion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance analysis for the fourth quarter of 2018, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, it is more likely than not that FirstBank, the banking subsidiary, will generate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL carry-forward periods to realize $220.5 million of its deferred tax assets related to NOLs and, therefore, reversed $63.2 million of the valuation allowance. The decision to partially reverse the valuation allowance was reached after weighting all of the evidence and determining that the positive evidence out-weighted the negative evidence. The positive evidence considered by management in arriving at its decision to reverse part of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was primarily driven by: FirstBank's three-year cumulative income position; the continued profitability following the hurricane events in 2017; and forecasts of future profitability, under several potential scenarios, that support significant utilization of NOLs prior to their expiration ranging between the years 2021 through 2024. The negative evidence considered by management includes: uncertainties around the state of the Puerto Rico economy, including the effect of hurricane recovery funds together with Puerto Rico government debt renegotiation efforts and the ultimate sustainability of the approved Fiscal Plan; and consideration of the Corporation's still elevated levels of non-performing assets.\nManagement's estimate of future taxable income is based on internal projections that consider historical performance, multiple internal scenarios and assumptions, as well as external data that management believes is reasonable. If events are identified that affect the Corporation's ability to utilize its deferred tax assets, the analysis will be updated to determine if any adjustments to the valuation allowance are required. If actual results differ significantly from the current estimates of future taxable income, even if caused by adverse macro-economic conditions, the remaining valuation allowance may need to be increased. Such an increase could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, a higher than projected proportion of taxable income to exempt income could lead to a higher usage of available NOLs and a lower amount of disallowed NOLs from projected levels of tax-exempt income, per the 2011 PR code, which in turn could result in further releases to the deferred tax valuation allowance; any such decreases could have a material positive effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately $104 million of the deferred tax assets of the Corporation are attributable to temporary differences or tax credit carry-forwards that have no expiration date, compared to $125.6 million in 2017. The valuation allowance attributable to FirstBank's deferred tax assets of $68.1 million as of December 31, 2018 is related to the estimated NOL disallowance attributable to projected levels of tax-exempt income, NOLs attributable to the Virgin Islands jurisdiction, and capital losses. The remaining balance of $32.6 million of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance non-attributable to FirstBank is mainly related to NOLs and capital losses at the Holding Company and the Bank's subsidiary First Management of Puerto Rico. The Corporation will continue to provide a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in each applicable tax jurisdiction until the need for a valuation allowance is eliminated. The need for a valuation allowance is eliminated when the Corporation determines that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ability to recognize the remaining deferred tax assets that continue to be subject to a valuation allowance will be evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if there are any significant events that would affect the ability to utilize these deferred tax assets.\nThe Corporation has U.S. and USVI sourced NOL carryforwards. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the Section 382\u201d) limits the ability to utilize U.S. and USVI NOLs for income tax purposes in such jurisdictions following an event that is considered to be an ownership change. Generally, an ownership change\u201d occurs when certain shareholders increase their aggregate\nownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage over a three-year testing period. Upon the occurrence of a Section 382 ownership change, the use of NOLs attributable to the period prior to the ownership change is subject to limitations and only a portion of the U.S. and USVI NOLs may be used by the Corporation to offset its annual U.S. and USVI taxable income, if any.\nDuring 2017, the Corporation completed a formal ownership change analysis within the meaning of Section 382 covering a comprehensive period, and concluded that an ownership change occurred during such period. The ownership change and resulting Section 382 limitation did not cause a U.S. or USVI income tax liability or material income tax expense related to periods prior to 2017 since the Corporation had sufficient post-ownership change NOLs in those jurisdictions to offset taxable income. The Section 382 limitation resulted in higher U.S. and USVI income tax liabilities than we would have incurred in the absence of such limitation. The Corporation has mitigated to an extent the adverse effects associated with the Section 382 limitation as any such tax paid in the U.S. or USVI can be creditable against Puerto Rico tax liabilities or taken as a deduction against taxable income. However, our ability to reduce our Puerto Rico tax liability through such a credit or deduction depends on our tax profile at each annual taxable period, which is dependent on various factors. For the 2018 and 2017 year, and as a result of the Section 382 limitation, the Corporation incurred an income tax expense of approximately $3.8 million and $2.3 million, respectively, related to its U.S. operations. The limitation did not impact the USVI operations for the years 2018 and 2017.\n2017 compared to\nFor 2017, the Corporation recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $5.0 million compared to an income tax expense of $37.0 million for 2016. The tax benefit for 2017, when compared to the tax expense for 2016, was mostly attributable to the tax benefit related to the hurricane-related charges and to the $13.2 million tax benefit recorded in 2017 as a result of the above discussed change in tax status of certain subsidiaries from taxable corporations to limited liability companies that have elected to be treated as partnerships for income tax purposes in Puerto Rico. The $13.2 million tax benefit was primarily associated with the reversal of the $13.9 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a result of the change in tax status of First Federal Finance Corp., partially offset by the elimination of the $0.7 million deferred tax asset previously recorded at FirstBank Insurance. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was (8)% compared to 28% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nBased upon the Corporation's organizational structure and the information provided to the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and, to a lesser extent, the Board of Directors, the operating segments are based primarily on the Corporation's lines of business for its operations in Puerto Rico, the Corporation's principal market, and by geographic areas for its operations outside of Puerto Rico. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had six reportable segments: Commercial and Corporate Banking; Consumer (Retail) Banking; Mortgage Banking; Treasury and Investments; United States operations; and Virgin Islands operations. Management determined the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used to evaluate performance and to assess where to allocate resources. Other factors, such as the Corporation's organizational chart, nature of the products, distribution channels and the economic characteristics of its products, were also considered in the determination of the reportable segments. For additional information regarding First BanCorp.'s reportable segments, please refer to Note 35 - Segment Information,\u201d of the Corporation's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 - Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Corporation's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Corporation evaluates the performance of the segments based on net interest income, the provision for loan and lease losses, non-interest income, and direct non-interest expenses. The segments are also evaluated based on the average volume of their interest-earning assets less the allowance for loan and lease losses. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, other operating expenses not allocated to a particular segment amounted to $107.5 million, $105.4 million, and $101.1 million, respectively. Expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segment but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. The unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses and related depreciation and amortization expenses.\nThe Treasury and Investments segment lends funds to the Consumer (Retail) Banking, Mortgage Banking and Commercial and Corporate Banking segments to finance their lending activities and borrows from those segments. The Consumer (Retail) Banking and the United States Operations segments also lend funds to other segments. The interest rates charged or credited by Treasury and Investment, the Consumer (Retail) Banking and the United States Operations segments are allocated based on market rates. The difference between the allocated interest income or expense and the Corporation's actual net interest income from centralized management of funding costs is reported in the Treasury and Investments segment.\nCommercial and Corporate Banking\nThe Commercial and Corporate Banking segment consists of the Corporation's lending and other services for large customers represented by specialized and middle-market clients and the public sector. FirstBank has developed expertise in a wide variety of industries. The Commercial and Corporate Banking segment offers commercial loans, including commercial real estate and construction loans, and floor plan financings, as well as other products, such as cash management and business management services. This segment also includes the Corporation's broker-dealer activities, which are primarily concentrated in investment banking activities, such as advisory services, capital raising efforts on behalf of clients and assistance with financial transaction structuring. A substantial portion of the commercial and corporate banking portfolio is secured by the underlying value of the real estate collateral and the personal guarantees of the borrowers. Since commercial loans involve greater credit risk than a typical residential mortgage loan because they are larger in size and more risk is concentrated in a single borrower, the Corporation has and maintains a credit risk management infrastructure designed to mitigate potential losses associated with commercial lending, including underwriting and loan review functions, sales of loan participations and continuous monitoring of concentrations within portfolios.\nThe highlights of the Commercial and Corporate Banking segment's financial results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 include the following:\n\u00b7 Segment income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $46.7 million compared to $30.7 million for 2017 and $35.3 million for 2016 for the reasons discussed below.\n\u00b7 Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $78.7 million compared to $92.0 million and $96.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decreases in net interest income in 2018 and 2017 were mainly related to increases in the cost of funds borrowed from other segments resulting from higher short-term market interest rates and a decline in the average balance of commercial and construction loans in Puerto Rico, partially offset by the upward repricing of variable-rate commercial loans during 2017. The average balance of commercial and construction loans in Puerto Rico declined by $215.6 million in 2018, compared to 2017, and by $193.4 million in 2017, compared to 2016.\n\u00b7 The provision for loan losses for 2018 was $4.8 million compared to $33.3 million and $28.6 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the provision for loan losses for 2018, compared to 2017, reflects the effect of net loan loss reserve releases of $6.2 million recorded in 2018 in connection with revised estimates associated with the effect of Hurricane Maria on commercial and construction loans in Puerto Rico, compared to a charge of $29.8 million recorded in 2017. This was partially offset by an $11.2 million charge to the provision related to fair value write-downs in excess of previously-established reserves on $44.4 million of nonaccrual commercial and construction loans in Puerto Rico transferred to held for sale in 2018. The increase in the provision for loan losses for 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly related to the $29.8 million charge related to inherent losses associated with the effect of Hurricane Maria on commercial and construction loans in Puerto Rico, partially offset by lower specific reserve requirements for impaired loans and an increase in loan loss recoveries.\n\u00b7 Total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $5.2 million compared to $7.2 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly related to charges of $3.3 million related to fair value adjustments and losses realized on the sale of certain nonaccrual construction and commercial loans held for sale in 2018, partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in fee income form merchant-related transactions allocated to this operating segment. The decrease for 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly related to the effect in 2016 of fee income amounting to $0.8 million from the broker-dealer subsidiary primarily associated with the sale of large fixed annuities contracts.\n\u00b7 Direct non-interest expenses for 2018 were $32.4 million, compared to $35.1 million in 2017, and $40.7 million in 2016. The decrease in 2018, compared to 2017, reflects a $1.5 million decrease related to the portion of the FDIC deposit insurance premium allocated to this operating segment, a $1.2 million decrease in attorneys' collection and legal fees related to resolution efforts relating to problem loans in Puerto Rico. The decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, reflects a $2.0 million decrease related to the portion of the FDIC deposit insurance premium allocated to this segment, a $2.1 million decrease in the provision for unfunded lending commitments, primarily related to lower unused balances on floor plan revolving credit agreements, and a $1.0 million aggregate decrease in losses from OREO operations and troubled loan resolution effort expenses in Puerto Rico.\nConsumer (Retail) Banking\nThe Consumer (Retail) Banking segment consists of the Corporation's consumer lending and deposit-taking activities conducted mainly through FirstBank's branch network in Puerto Rico. Loans to consumers include auto, boat and personal loans, credit cards and lines of credit. Deposit products include interest-bearing and non-interest bearing checking and savings accounts, Individual Retirement Accounts and retail CDs. Retail deposits gathered through each branch of FirstBank's retail network serve as one of the funding sources for the lending and investment activities.\nConsumer lending has been mainly driven by auto loan originations. The Corporation follows a strategy of seeking to provide outstanding service to selected auto dealers that provide the channel for the bulk of the Corporation's auto loan originations.\nPersonal loans, credit cards, and, to a lesser extent, marine financing also contribute to interest income generated on consumer lending. Management plans to continue to be active in the consumer loan market, applying the Corporation's strict underwriting standards. Other activities included in this segment are finance leases and insurance activities in Puerto Rico.\nThe highlights of the Consumer (Retail) Banking segment's financial results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 include the following:\n\u00b7 Segment income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $129.9 million compared to $57.9 million and $66.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for the reasons discussed below.\n\u00b7 Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $217.9 million compared to $175.9 million and $168.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly due to higher income from funds loaned to other business segments due to both the growth in non-brokered deposits, mainly non-interest bearing deposits, that, among others things, served as funding source for lending activities of other operating segments, and higher medium-term market interest rates. In addition, the average volume of consumer loans in Puerto Rico increased by $77.5 million. The increase in 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly due to higher income from funds loaned to other business segments due to higher medium-term market interest rates in 2017, partially offset by a $41.7 million decrease in the average volume of consumer loans in Puerto Rico.\n\u00b7 The provision for loan and lease losses for 2018 decreased by $30.3 million to $23.5 million compared to 2017 and increased by $19.5 million to $53.8 million when comparing 2017 with 2016. The decrease in the provision for loan losses for 2018, compared to 2017, reflects the effect of net loan loss reserve releases of $7.6 million recorded in 2018 in connection with revised estimates associated with the effect of Hurricane Maria on consumer loans in Puerto Rico, compared to a charge of $23.7 million recorded in 2017. The increase in the provision for loan and lease losses in 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly related to the aforementioned hurricane-related charge of $23.7 million, partially offset by lower delinquency levels in 2017.\n\u00b7 Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $47.7 million compared to $43.9 million and $44.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly related to a $3.2 million increase in transaction fee income from ATMs and POS, and credit and debit card interchange fees. The decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly related to a $0.3 million decrease in insurance commission income, and a $1.6 million decrease in service charges on deposits, reflecting a decline in the number of returned items and overdraft transactions adversely affected by business activity disruptions caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, partially offset by an increase of $1.4 million in ATM and POS fee income.\n\u00b7 Direct non-interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $112.2 million compared to $108.2 million and $112.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly related to a $2.2 million increase in credit and debit card processing expenses related to higher transaction volumes, a $1.1 million increase in advertising, marketing and promotion-related expenses, a $0.9 million increase in credit card rewards program costs, and a $0.7 million increase in professional services fees, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in the portion of the FDIC insurance premium expense allocated to this operating segment. The decrease for 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly driven by a $1.8 million reduction in the portion of the FDIC insurance premium expense allocated to this operating segment, a $0.4 million decrease in losses and expenses related to non-real estate repossessed assets, a $0.6 million decrease in credit and debit card processing expenses, primarily associated with a lower volume of transactions affected by the drop in business activity in Puerto Rico after the hurricanes in 2017, a $2.5 million decrease in employees' compensation and benefits, including the aforementioned effect of hurricane-related expected insurance recoveries of $0.4 million allocated to this segment, and a $1.0 million decrease in professional service fees, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in occupancy and equipment costs, and a $1.8 million increase in credit card rewards program costs.\nMortgage Banking\nThe Mortgage Banking segment conducts its operations mainly through FirstBank. The operation consists of the origination, sale and servicing of a variety of residential mortgage loan products. Originations are sourced through different channels, such as FirstBank branches and purchases from mortgage bankers, and in association with new project developers. The mortgage banking segment focuses on originating residential real estate loans, some of which conform to the FHA, VA and RD standards. Loans originated that meet the FHA's standards qualify for the FHA's insurance program whereas loans that meet the standards of the VA and the RD are guaranteed by their respective federal agencies.\nMortgage loans that do not qualify under these programs are commonly referred to as conventional loans. Conventional real estate loans can be conforming or non-conforming. Conforming loans are residential real estate loans that meet the standards for sale under the FNMA and FHLMC programs whereas loans that do not meet those standards are referred to as non-conforming residential real estate loans. The Corporation's strategy is to penetrate markets by providing customers with a variety of high quality mortgage products to serve their financial needs through a faster and simpler process and at competitive prices. The Mortgage Banking segment also acquires and sells mortgages in the secondary markets. Residential real estate conforming loans are sold to investors like FNMA and FHLMC. The Corporation has commitment authority to issue GNMA mortgage-backed securities.\nThe highlights of the Mortgage Banking segment's financial results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 include the following:\n\u00b7 Segment income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $45.2 million compared to $14.7 million for 2017 and $46.0 million for 2016 for the reasons discussed below.\n\u00b7 Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $79.4 million compared to $86.0 million and $89.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in net interest income in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly due to a decrease of $92.0 million in the average balance of residential mortgage loans in Puerto Rico and increases in the cost of funds borrowed from other segments resulting from higher short-term market interest rates. The decrease in net interest income in 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly due to both a higher level of inflows of residential mortgage loans to non-performing status adversely affected by interruptions in collection efforts resulting from Hurricane Maria and a decrease of $108.6 million in the average balance of residential mortgage loans in Puerto Rico.\n\u00b7 The provision for loan and lease losses for 2018 was $13.1 million compared to $47.7 million and $24.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the provision for 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly due to the effect in 2017 of a $12.3 million charge related to inherent losses associated with the effect of Hurricane Maria on residential mortgage loans in Puerto Rico, declines in charge-offs, nonaccrual, and delinquent loan levels, the overall decrease in the size of this portfolio, and the effect in 2017 of adjustments to the loss severity estimates used in the calculation of the general reserve. The increase in the provision for 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly driven by the aforementioned $12.3 million hurricane-related charge, and a higher level of nonaccrual residential mortgage loans, increased specific reserves for residential mortgage TDR loans, and higher loss severity estimates in 2017, including adjustments to liquidation cost assumptions.\n\u00b7 Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $17.1 million compared to $12.8 million and $19.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly due to a positive net variance of $2.9 million related to adjustments recorded against the valuation allowance of mortgage servicing rights, and a $1.1 million increase in mortgage servicing fees. The decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly due to lower gains on sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market associated with both the drop in business activity in Puerto Rico after the hurricanes and higher market interest rates in 2017.\n\u00b7 Direct non-interest expenses in 2018 were $38.2 million compared to $36.4 million and $38.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly related to a $4.3 million increase in losses on OREO operations, partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in the portion of the FDIC insurance premium allocated to this operating segment, and a $0.6 million decrease in professional service fees. The decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly related to a $2.1 million decrease in the portion of the FDIC insurance premium allocated to this segment, a $0.4 million decrease in business promotion expenses, and a $1.0 million decrease in losses on OREO operations, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in professional service fees including expenses related to the implementation of new technology systems.\nTreasury and Investments\nThe Treasury and Investments segment is responsible for the Corporation's treasury and investment management functions. The treasury function, which includes funding and liquidity management, lends funds to the Commercial and Corporate Banking segment, the Mortgage Banking segment, and the Consumer (Retail) Banking segment to finance their respective lending activities and borrows from those segments. Funds not gathered by the different business units are obtained by the Treasury function through wholesale channels, such as brokered deposits, advances from the FHLB, and repurchase agreements with investment securities, among others.\nThe investment function is intended to implement a leverage strategy for the purposes of liquidity management, interest rate risk management and earnings enhancement.\nThe interest rates charged or credited by Treasury and Investments are based on market rates.\nThe highlights of the Treasury and Investments segment's financial results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 include the following:\n\u00b7 Segment income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $61.2 million compared to $41.8 million for 2017 and $54.6 million for 2016 for the reasons discussed below.\n\u00b7 Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $61.6 million compared to net interest income of $55.4 million and $53.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in net interest income in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly related to the gradual reinvestment of liquidity into higher-yielding U.S. agencies MBS and debt securities and the decrease in the average balance of brokered CDs, partially offset by lower income from funds loaned to other business segments due to the overall decrease in the average volume of commercial and residential mortgage loans in Puerto Rico and a higher proportion of the lending activities of other operating segments funded by the growth in non-interest bearing deposits of the Consumer (Retail) Banking operating segment. The increase in net interest income in 2017, compared to 2016, reflects reductions in interest expense associated with the full-year effect of the repayment of $400 million of repurchase agreements that matured in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 that carried an average cost of 3.35% and a decrease in the average balance of brokered CDs.\n\u00b7 Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $2.5 million, compared to non-interest loss of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and non-interest income of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The non-interest income reported in 2018 consisted primarily of the $2.3 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $7.3 million in trust-preferred securities. The loss for 2017 was driven by OTTI charges on Puerto Rico government debt securities of $12.2 million, partially offset by the $1.4 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $7.3 million in trust-preferred securities. The non-interest income reported in 2016 consisted mainly of the $6.1 million gain on sales of U.S. agency MBS, the $4.2 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $10 million in trust-preferred securities, and the $1.5 million recovery of a residual CMO previously written off, partially offset by OTTI charges on debt securities of $6.7 million recorded in 2016, primarily on Puerto Rico government debt securities.\n\u00b7 Direct non-interest expenses for 2018 were $3.0 million compared to $3.4 million and $4.0 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The variances are primarily related to costs incurred in professional service fees that decreased by $0.4 million in 2018, compared to 2017, and decreased by $0.5 million in 2017, compared to 2016.\nUnited States Operations\nThe United States Operations segment consists of all banking activities conducted by FirstBank on the United States mainland. FirstBank provides a wide range of banking services to individual and corporate customers primarily in southern Florida through 10 banking branches. The United States Operations segment offers an array of both consumer and commercial banking products and services. Consumer banking products include checking, savings and money market accounts, retail CDs, internet banking services, residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, and automobile loans. Retail deposits, as well as FHLB advances and brokered CDs, allocated to this operation serve as funding sources for its lending activities. Deposits gathered through FirstBank's branches in the United States also serve as one of the funding sources for the Corporation's overall lending and investment activities.\nThe commercial banking services include checking, savings and money market accounts, retail CDs, internet banking services, cash management services, remote data capture and automated clearing house, or ACH, transactions. Loan products include the traditional commercial and industrial ( C&I\u201d) and commercial real estate products, such as lines of credit, term loans and construction loans.\nThe highlights of the United States operations segment's financial results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 include the following:\n\u00b7 Segment income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $16.6 million compared to $16.0 million and $16.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for the reasons discussed below.\n\u00b7 Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $59.1 million compared to $49.2 million and $41.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly due to a $175.4 million increase in the average volume of loans in the United States, primarily commercial and construction loans, and the upward repricing of variable-rate commercial loans. The increase in 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly due to a $297.0 million increase in the average volume of loans in the United States, primarily commercial and residential mortgage loans.\n\u00b7 During 2018, a provision for loan losses of $11.9 million was recorded for this operating segment, compared to $3.6 million for 2017 and a negative provision of $1.4 million for 2016. The increase in the provision for loan losses in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily reflects the effect of charges of $9.2 million to the specific reserve of a commercial mortgage loan designated as impaired in 2018 and the overall increase in the size of the loan portfolio. The variance in the provision for loan losses in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily reflects the build-up of general reserves associated with the growth in the commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolio in 2017.\n\u00b7 Total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $3.0 million compared to $2.7 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily reflects the effect of a $0.2 million gain realized on $9.8 million of seasoned residential mortgage loans sold to FNMA in 2018. The decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly due to the effect in 2016 of a $0.4 million fee recorded as income associated with a terminated credit agreement in which the Bank was committed to purchase a loan participation, and a $0.4 million decrease in gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans attributable to this segment.\n\u00b7 Direct non-interest expenses in 2018 were $33.6 million compared to $32.2 million and $30.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly due to an increase of $1.4 million in employees' compensation and benefits, and a $0.4 million increase in professional service fees, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in the allocation of the FDIC insurance premium expense. The increase in 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly due to an increase of $1.5 million in employees' compensation and benefits, a $0.2 million increase in occupancy and equipment costs, and a $0.4 million increase in professional service fees, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in the allocation of the FDIC insurance premium expense.\nVirgin Islands Operations\nThe Virgin Islands Operations segment consists of all banking activities conducted by FirstBank in the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, including retail and commercial banking services, with a total of 11 banking branches currently serving the islands in the USVI of St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, and the island of Tortola in the BVI. The Virgin Islands Operations segment is driven by its consumer, commercial lending and deposit-taking activities.\nLoans to consumers include auto, boat, lines of credit, and personal and residential mortgage loans. Deposit products include interest-bearing and non-interest bearing checking and savings accounts, IRAs, and retail CDs. Retail deposits gathered through each branch serve as the funding sources for its own lending activities.\nThe highlights of the Virgin Islands operations' financial results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 include the following:\n\u00b7 Segment loss before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.4 million compared to income of $6.3 million and $13.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for the reasons discussed below.\n\u00b7 Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $28.7 million compared to $33.2 million and $34.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in net interest income in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly related to a $39.5 million decrease in the average balance of commercial and construction loans and a $23.1 million decrease in the average balance of residential mortgage loans. The decrease in net interest income in 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly driven by a $32.8 million decrease in the average balance of residential mortgage loans that offset the $29.8 million increase in the average volume of commercial loans, and the adverse impact of higher inflows of loans to non-performing status adversely affected by interruptions in business activity resulting from Hurricane Irma in the USVI and the BVI.\n\u00b7 During 2018, a provision of $6.0 million was recorded for this segment, compared to a provision of $5.8 million in 2017 and $0.4 million for 2016. The slight increase in the provision for 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly related to charges of $7.4 million recorded in 2018 associated with developments in problem loan resolution strategies, including a $4.5 million charge related to a fair value write-down in excess of a previously-established reserve on a $30.0 million construction loan transferred to held for sale, partially offset by the effect in 2017 of a $5.6 million charge related to inherent losses associated with the effect of Hurricane Irma in the USVI and the BVI. The increase in the provision for 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly driven by the aforementioned hurricane-related charge of $5.6 million.\n\u00b7 Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $6.8 million, compared to $6.0 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly related to a $0.5 million increase in fee-based income from ATMs, POS, credit and debit cards, and merchant-related activities. The decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly driven by a $0.3 million decrease in non-deferrable loan fees, and the effect in 2016 of a $0.6 million gain on the sale of a real estate property.\n\u00b7 Direct non-interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $31.0 million compared to $27.0 million and $27.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly due to a $2.2 million increase in occupancy and equipment costs, including $1.3 million of hurricane-related expenses incurred in 2018 associated with repairs and security matters, a $0.7 million increase in employees' compensation and benefits, and a $0.7 million increase in professional services fees. The decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, was mainly driven by a $0.7 decrease in employees' compensation and benefits, including the effect of expected insurance recoveries of $0.1 million allocated to this segment in connection with payroll costs incurred when Hurricane Irma precluded employees from working during 2017.\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING DATA

increase of $232.9 million. The variance primarily reflects an increase of $207.3 million in the average volume of interest-bearing cash balances, mainly consisting of deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a $181.4 million increase in the average balance of investment securities, driven by purchases of U.S. agency MBS and debt securities, partially offset by a decrease of $119.5 million in the average volume of loans, primarily in commercial and residential mortgage loans.\nThe Corporation's total average liabilities were $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $180.6 million compared to December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly related to a $779.1 million increase in the average balance of non-brokered deposits, including an increase of $629.8 million in the average balance of non-interest bearing deposits, and an increase of $24.0 million in the average balance of FHLB advances, partially offset by a decrease of $480.2 million in the average balance of brokered CDs, a decrease of $134.0 million in the average balance of repurchase agreements, and a $27.3 million decrease in the average balance of junior subordinated debentures associated with trust-preferred securities.\nAssets\nThe Corporation's total assets were $12.2 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $17.7 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly due to a $130.2 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, largely driven by liquidity used to repay maturing brokered CDs and borrowings, and a $16.5 million decrease in the OREO portfolio balance.\nThese variances were partially offset by a $51.6 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities driven by purchases of U.S. agencies MBS and debt securities, a $25.0 million increase in the net deferred tax asset, and a $17.9 million increase in total loans, as further discussed below. The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $35.5 million during 2018 reflecting, among other things, the effect of releases associated with revised estimates of the hurricane-related qualitative reserves.\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> Loans Receivable, including Loans Held for Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The increase consisted of a $168.6 million growth in the Florida region, partially offset by reductions of $103.4 million and $47.4 million in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico regions, respectively. Total loans for 2018 reflect an increase in the consumer loan portfolio of $194.8 million, partially offset by reductions of $125.4 million and $51.6 million in the residential mortgage and commercial and construction loan portfolios, respectively.\nThe increase in total loans in the Florida region consisted of a $164.8 million growth in commercial and construction loans, a $2.2 million increase in consumer loans, and a $1.7 million increase in residential mortgage loans. In recent years, the Corporation has invested in facilities, increased its resources dedicated to commercial and corporate banking functions and invested in a technology platform in Florida as the Corporation expects to achieve continued growth in this region.\nThe decrease in total loans in the Puerto Rico region consisted of a $143.1 million decrease in commercial and construction loans and a $96.5 million decrease in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by a $192.2 million growth in consumer loans. The decrease in commercial and construction loans was mainly related to eight large commercial loans paid off during 2018 totaling $88.7 million, the sale of four large adversely-classified commercial and construction loans totaling $39.1 million, and charge-offs and repayments recorded during 2018. These declines were partially offset by certain large originations closed in 2018, including three new commercial loans, each in individual amount in excess of $15 million and totaling $64.0 million, and purchases and refinancings that increased the balance of two participated commercial loans by approximately $44.8 million.\nThe decrease in total loans in the Virgin Islands region consisted of a $73.3 million decrease in commercial and construction loans and a $30.5 million decrease in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in consumer loans. The decrease in commercial and construction loans was driven by the sale of a nonaccrual construction loan of $27.0 million (net of charge-offs of $5.1 million and payments of $3.0 million recorded on such loan during 2018), a $14.6 million decrease in the outstanding principal balance of loans granted to government entities, and a $6.7 million commercial mortgage loan paid off in 2018.\nAs shown in the table above, as of December 31, 2018, the loans held-for-investment portfolio was comprised of commercial and construction loans (42%), residential real estate loans (36%), and consumer and finance leases (22%). Of the total gross loan portfolio held for investment of $8.9 billion as of December 31, 2018, approximately 74% had credit risk concentration in Puerto Rico, 21% in the United States (mainly in the

investment decreased by $127.7 million, as compared to the balance as of December 31, 2017, mainly resulting from activities in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as principal repayments, charge-offs, and foreclosures exceeded the volume of new loans originated and held for investment purposes. The residential mortgage loan portfolio held for investment in the Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands regions decreased during year 2018 by $100.1 million and $30.4 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of $2.8 million in the Florida region. Approximately 77% of the $420.7 million in residential mortgage loans originated in Puerto Rico during 2018 consisted of conforming loan originations sold in the secondary market and refinancings. The increase in the Florida region was achieved despite the sale of $9.8 million of seasoned residential mortgage loans to FNMA in the second quarter of 2018.\nThe majority of the Corporation's outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands consisted of fixed-rate loans that traditionally carried higher yields than residential mortgage loans in Florida. In the Florida region, approximately 56% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio consisted of adjustable-rate mortgages. In accordance with the Corporation's underwriting guidelines, residential mortgage loans are mostly fully documented loans, and the Corporation does not originate negative amortization loans.\nResidential mortgage loan originations and purchases for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $532.0 million compared to $549.1 million for 2017 and $749.7 million for 2016. These statistics include purchases from mortgage bankers of $46.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $58.9 million in 2017 and $85.0 million in 2016. The lower volume of residential mortgage loan originations in 2018, compared to 2017, consisted of a $62.8 million decline in the Florida region, partially offset by an increase of $45.5 million in Puerto Rico. Loan originations in 2017 were adversely affected by disruptions in economic activity associated with Hurricanes Irma and Maria, primarily in the Puerto Rico region.\nCommercial and Construction Loans\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Corporation's commercial and construction loan portfolio, including loans held for sale, decreased by $51.6 million to $3.8 billion, as compared to the balance as of December 31, 2017. The decrease consisted of declines of $143.1 million and $73.3 million in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, respectively, partially offset by a $164.8 million growth in the Florida region. As explained above, the decline in the Puerto Rico and the Virgin Island regions include the effect of adversely-classified and nonaccrual loans sold during 2018 totaling $66.1 million (net of charge-offs of $11.0 million and payments of $7.4 million recorded on such loans during 2018), and the repayment in 2018 of certain large commercial loans individually in excess of $5 million and totaling $95.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $61.6 million outstanding in loans extended to the Puerto Rico government, its municipalities and public corporations, compared to $55.9 million as of December 31, 2017. Approximately $47.2 million of the outstanding loans as of December 31, 2018 consisted of loans extended to municipalities in Puerto Rico, which in most cases are supported by assigned property tax revenues. The vast majority of revenues of the municipalities included in the Corporation's loan portfolio are independent of the Puerto Rico central government. These municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as are required for the payment of all of their respective general obligation bonds and notes. Late in 2015, the GDB and the Municipal Revenue Collection Center ( CRIM\u201d) signed and perfected a deed of trust. Through this deed, the GDB, as fiduciary, is bound to keep the CRIM funds separate from any other deposits and must distribute the funds pursuant to applicable law. The CRIM funds are deposited at another commercial depository financial institution in Puerto Rico. In addition to loans extended to municipalities, the Corporation's exposure to the Puerto Rico government as of December 31, 2018 included a $14.5 million loan granted to an affiliate of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority ( PREPA\u201d).\nThe Corporation also has credit exposure to USVI government entities. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $55.8 million in loans to USVI government instrumentalities and public corporations, compared to $70.4 million as of December 31, 2017. Of the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2018, public corporations of the USVI owed approximately $32.6 million and an independent instrumentality of the USVI government owed approximately $23.2 million. As of December 31, 2018, all loans were currently performing and up to date on principal and interest payments.\nFurthermore, during 2018, the Corporation reached resolution on the three commercial mortgage loans granted to the hotel industry in Puerto Rico that were formerly guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Tourism Development Fund ( TDF\u201d). Historically, the borrower and the operations of the underlying collateral of these loans were the primary sources of repayment and the TDF, which is a subsidiary of the GDB, provided a secondary guarantee for payment performance. The Corporation sold two of these three loan that carried a book value of $27.2 million (net of cumulative charge-offs of $22.0 million), realizing an additional loss of $2.7 million at the time of sale in 2018. In addition, the largest of these three facilities was paid-off during the fourth quarter of 2018. This facility carried a book value of $28.8 million (net of cumulative charge-offs of $28.4 million). A loan loss recovery of $7.4 million was recorded at the time of the repayment in 2018. The sales and repayments of such loans resulted in a $70.8 million reduction in nonaccrual loans during 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Corporation's total exposure to shared national credit ( SNC\u201d) loans amounted to $844.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $277.6 million of the SNC exposure related to the portfolio in Puerto Rico and $567.1 million related to the portfolio in the Florida region.\nCommercial and construction loan originations (excluding government loans) amounted to $1.8 billion for each of 2018 and 2017, and $1.6 billion in 2016. A decrease of $19.4 million, when compared to 2017, reflect a decrease of $27.5 million in Florida, partially offset by increases of $6.3 million and $1.4 million in the Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands regions, respectively.\nGovernment loan originations for 2018 amounted to $34.6 million, mainly related to the origination in the third quarter of 2018 of a $15.0 million loan extended to a municipality in Puerto Rico and the utilization of an overdraft line of credit of a government entity in the Virgin Islands region. There were no government loans originated in 2017, compared to government loan originations of $54.8 million in 2016.\nThe composition of the Corporation's construction loan portfolio held for investment as of December 31, 2018 by category and geographic location follows:\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> As of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Puerto Rico\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Virgin Islands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans for residential housing projects:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMid-rise (1)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,501\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSingle-family, detached\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,280\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total for residential housing projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,781\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction loans to individuals secured by residential properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,377\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans for commercial projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,972\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land loans -

The increase primarily reflects increases in auto loans, finance leases, and personal loans, which increased by $102.1 million, $76.1 million, and $36.4 million, respectively, partially offset by reductions in credit card, boat loans and home equity lines of credit of $13.2 million, $3.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The increase was primarily associated with a higher level of consumer loan originations in the Puerto Rico region during 2018.\nOriginations of auto loans (including finance leases) in 2018 amounted to $588.3 million, an increase of $199.5 million, compared to $388.8 million in 2017. The increase was primarily reflected in the Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands regions with increases of $196.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $1.5 million reduction in Florida. Personal loan originations in 2018, other than credit cards, amounted to $225.6 million compared to $183.7 million in 2017. Most of the increase in personal loan originations was reflected in the Puerto Rico region. The utilization activity on the outstanding credit card portfolio in 2018 amounted to $342.4 million compared to $306.6 million in 2017.\nInvestment Activities\nAs part of its liquidity, revenue diversification and interest rate risk strategies, First BanCorp. maintains an investment portfolio that is classified as available for sale or held to maturity. The Corporation's total available-for-sale investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2018 amounted to $1.9 billion, a $51.6 million increase from December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly driven by purchases of U.S. agencies' debt and mortgage-backed securities totaling $459.8 million (average yield of 3.09%), partially offset by prepayments of $215.5 million related to U.S. agencies' pass-through mortgage-backed securities and SBA guaranteed certificates, the maturity during 2018 of $122.5 million of U.S. agencies debt securities, sales of $47.8 million of U.S. agency MBS and debt securities, and a $19.8 million decrease in the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 99% of the Corporation's available-for-sale securities portfolio was invested in U.S. Government and agency debentures and fixed-rate U.S. government-sponsored agencies MBS (mainly GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC fixed-rate securities). In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation owned bonds of the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority classified as available for sale in the aggregate amount of $8.2 million, carried on the Corporation's books at their aggregate fair value of $7.0 million, which were current as to contractual payments as of December 31, 2018. Approximately $4.2 million (fair value - $2.8 million) of these bonds consist of residential pass-through mortgage-backed securities issued by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority that are collateralized by certain second mortgages originated under a program launched by the Puerto Rico government in 2010. These bonds were structured as zero-coupon bonds for the first ten years (up to July 2019).\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Corporation's held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio amounted to $144.8 million, down $5.8 million from December 31, 2017. Held-to-maturity investment securities consisted of financing arrangements with Puerto Rico municipalities issued in bond form, which are accounted for as securities, but were underwritten as loans with features that are typically found in commercial loans. These obligations typically are not issued in bearer form, are not registered with the SEC, and are not rated by external credit agencies. These bonds have seniority to the payment of operating costs and expenses of the municipality and are supported by assigned property tax revenues. Approximately 70% of the Corporation's municipality bonds consisted of obligations issued by three of the largest municipalities in Puerto Rico. These municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as are required for the payment of all of their respective general obligation bonds and loans.\nSee Risk Management - Exposure to Puerto Rico Government\u201d below for information and details about the Corporation's total direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government.\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> The

Any acceleration in the prepayments of mortgage-backed securities would lower yields on these securities, as the amortization of premiums paid upon acquisition of these securities would accelerate. Conversely, acceleration of the prepayments of mortgage-backed securities would increase yields on securities purchased at a discount, as the amortization of the discount would accelerate. These risks are directly linked to future period market interest rate fluctuations. Also, net interest income in future periods might be affected by the Corporation's investment in callable securities. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had approximately $286.2 million in debt securities (U.S. Agencies and Puerto Rico government securities) with embedded calls, primarily purchased at a discount, and with an average yield of 2.74%. See Risk Management\u201d below for further analysis of the effects of changing interest rates on the Corporation's net interest income and the interest rate risk management strategies followed by the Corporation.

activities and operations. Consequently, effective risk management is fundamental to the success of the Corporation. The primary goals of risk management are to ensure that the Corporation's risk-taking activities are consistent with the Corporation's objectives and risk tolerance, and that there is an appropriate balance between risk and reward in order to maximize stockholder value.\nThe Corporation has in place a risk management framework to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks assumed in conducting its activities. First BanCorp.'s business is subject to eleven broad categories of risks: (1) liquidity risk; (2) interest rate risk; (3) market risk; (4) credit risk; (5) operational risk; (6) legal and compliance risk; (7) reputational risk; (8) model risk; (9) capital risk; (10) strategic risk; and (11) information technology risk. First BanCorp. has adopted policies and procedures designed to identify and manage the risks to which the Corporation is exposed.\nRisk Definition\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from the possibility that the Corporation will not have sufficient cash to meet its short-term liquidity demands, such as from deposit redemptions or loan commitments. See Liquidity and Capital Adequacy below for further details.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk arising from adverse movements in interest rates. See Interest Rate Risk Management below for further details.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk arising from adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates or equity prices. The Corporation evaluates market risk together with interest rate risk. Both changes in market values and changes in interest rates are evaluated and forecasted. See Interest Rate Risk Management below for further details.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk arising from a borrower's or a counterparty's failure to meet the terms of a contract with the Corporation or otherwise to perform as agreed. See Credit Risk Management below for further details.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk arising from problems with the delivery of services or products. This risk is a function of internal controls, information systems, employee integrity and operating processes. It also includes risks associated with the Corporation's preparedness for the occurrence of an unforeseen event. This risk is inherent across all functions, products and services of the Corporation. See Operational Risk below for further details.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\nLegal and regulatory risk is the risk arising from the Corporation's failure to comply with laws or regulations that can adversely affect the Corporation's reputation and/or increase its exposure to litigation or penalties.\nReputational Risk\nReputational risk is the risk arising from any adverse effect on the Corporation's market value, capital or earnings arising from negative public opinion, whether true or not. This risk affects the Corporation's ability to establish new relationships or services, or to continue servicing existing relationships.\nModel Risk\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. The use of models exposes the Corporation to some level of model risk. Model errors can contribute to incorrect valuations and lead to operational errors, inappropriate business decisions or incorrect financial entries. Model risk can be reduced substantially through rigorous model identification and validation.\nCapital Risk\nCapital risk is the risk that the Corporation may lose value on its capital or have an inadequate capital plan, which would result in insufficient capital resources to meet minimum regulatory requirements (the Corporation's authority to operate as a bank is dependent upon the maintenance of adequate capital resources), support its credit rating, or support its growth and strategic options.\nStrategic Risk\nStrategic risk refers to the risk arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. This risk is a function of the compatibility of the Corporation's strategic goals, the business strategies developed to achieve those goals, the resources deployed against these goals, and the quality of implementation.\nInformation Technology Risk\nInformation Technology risk is the risk arising from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information systems and of cyber incidents or data breaches. It includes business risks associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence, and adoption of information technology within the Corporation.\nRisk Governance\nThe following discussion highlights the roles and responsibilities of the key participants in the Corporation's risk management framework:\nBoard of Directors\nThe Board of Directors oversees the Corporation's overall risk governance program with the assistance of the Board Committees discussed below.\nRisk Committee\nThe Risk Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibility to oversee the Corporation's management of its company-wide risk management framework.

Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet liquidity needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Corporation's business operations or unanticipated events.\nThe Corporation manages liquidity at two levels. The first is the liquidity of the parent company, which is the holding company that owns the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. The second is the liquidity of the banking subsidiary. As of December 31, 2018, FirstBank could not pay any dividend to the holding company, except upon receipt of required regulatory approvals. During 2018, the Corporation reinstated quarterly dividend payments on its common stock, and continued to pay quarterly interest payments on the subordinated debentures associated with its trust preferred securities and the monthly dividend income on its non-cumulative perpetual monthly income preferred stock pursuant to regulatory approvals.\nThe Asset and Liability Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the Corporation's liquidity policy, as well as approving operating and contingency procedures and monitoring liquidity on an ongoing basis. The MIALCO, using measures of liquidity developed by management that involve the use of several assumptions, reviews the Corporation's liquidity position on a monthly basis. The MIALCO oversees liquidity management, interest rate risk and other related matters.\nThe MIALCO, which reports to the Board of Directors' Asset and Liability Committee, is composed of senior management officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, the Retail Financial Services Director, the Risk Manager of the Treasury and Investments Division, the Financial Analysis and Asset/Liability Director and the Treasurer. The Treasury and Investments Division is responsible for planning and executing the Corporation's funding activities and strategy, monitoring liquidity availability on a daily basis, and reviewing liquidity measures on a weekly basis. The Treasury and Investments Accounting and Operations area of the Comptroller's Department is responsible for calculating the liquidity measurements used by the Treasury and Investment Division to review the Corporation's liquidity position on a monthly basis. The Financial Analysis and Asset/Liability Director estimates the liquidity gap for longer periods.\nTo ensure adequate liquidity through the full range of potential operating environments and market conditions, the Corporation conducts its liquidity management and business activities in a manner that will preserve and enhance funding stability, flexibility and diversity. Key components of this operating strategy include a strong focus on the continued development of customer-based funding, the maintenance of direct relationships with wholesale market funding providers, and the maintenance of the ability to liquidate certain assets when, and if, requirements warrant.\nThe Corporation develops and maintains contingency funding plans. These plans evaluate the Corporation's liquidity position under various operating circumstances and are designed to help ensure that the Corporation will be able to operate through periods of stress when access to normal sources of funds is constrained. The plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress, specify and quantify sources of liquidity, outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through a difficult period, and define roles and responsibilities. Under the contingency funding plan, the Corporation stresses the balance sheet and the liquidity position to critical levels that imply difficulties in getting new funds or even maintaining the current funding position of the Corporation and the Bank and are designed to help ensure the ability of the Corporation and the Bank to honor its respective commitments. The Corporation has established liquidity triggers monitored by the MIALCO in order to maintain the ordinary funding of the banking business. Four different scenarios are defined in the contingency funding plan: local market event, credit rating downgrade, an economic cycle downturn event, and a concentration event. They are reviewed and approved annually by the Board of Directors' Asset and Liability Committee.\nThe Corporation manages its liquidity in a proactive manner and maintains a sound liquidity position. It uses multiple measures to monitor the liquidity position, including core liquidity, basic liquidity, and time-based reserve measures. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated core liquidity reserve (which includes cash and free liquid assets) was $1.9 billion, or 15.6% of total assets, relatively unchanged as compared to December 31, 2017. The basic liquidity ratio (which adds available secured lines of credit to the core liquidity) as of December 31, 2018 was approximately 19.0% of total assets, compared to 21.2% of total assets as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $422.2 million available for additional credit from the FHLB of New York. Unpledged liquid securities as of December 31, 2018, mainly fixed-rate MBS and U.S. agencies' debentures, amounted to approximately $1.2 billion. The Corporation does not rely on uncommitted inter-bank lines of credit (federal funds lines) to fund its operations and does not include them in the basic liquidity measure. As of December 31, 2018, the holding company had $17.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents at the Bank level as of December 31, 2018 were approximately $579.3 million. The Bank had $555.6 million in brokered CDs as of December 31, 2018, of which approximately $259.6 million mature over the next twelve months. Liquidity at the Bank level is highly-dependent on bank deposits, which fund 74% of the Bank's assets (or 69%, excluding brokered CDs).\nSources of Funding\nThe Corporation utilizes different sources of funding to help ensure that adequate levels of liquidity are available when needed. Diversification of funding sources is of great importance to protect the Corporation's liquidity from market disruptions. The principal sources of short-term funds are deposits, including brokered CDs, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and lines of credit with the FHLB.\nThe Asset Liability Committee of the Board of Directors reviews credit availability on a regular basis. The Corporation has also sold mortgage loans as a supplementary source of funding. Long-term funding has also been obtained in the past through the issuance of notes and long-term brokered CDs. The cost of these different alternatives, among other things, is taken into consideration.\nThe Corporation has continued reducing the amounts of its outstanding brokered CDs. As of December 31, 2018, the amount of brokered CDs had decreased $594.9 million to $555.6 million from $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. At the same time as the Corporation focuses on reducing its reliance on brokered CDs, it is seeking to add core deposits. In 2018, the Corporation increased non-brokered deposits, excluding government deposits, by $318.2 million to $7.5 billion, as further discussed below.\nThe Corporation continues to have access to financing through counterparties to repurchase agreements, the FHLB, and other agents, such as wholesale funding brokers. While liquidity is an ongoing challenge for all financial institutions, management believes that the Corporation's available borrowing capacity and efforts to grow retail deposits will be adequate to provide the necessary funding for the Corporation's business plans in the foreseeable future.\nThe Corporation's principal sources of funding are:\nDeposits\nThe following table presents the composition of total deposits:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Weighted Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost as of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing savings accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.64%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,334,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,401,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,518,496\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing checking accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.39%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,304,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,207,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,075,929\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.61%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,960,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,580,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,752,625\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.03%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,599,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,188,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,347,050\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,395,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,833,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,484,155\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,994,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,022,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,831,205\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing deposits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage balance outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,874,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,204,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,750,185\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest-bearing deposits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage balance outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,209,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,580,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,415,913\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average rate during\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nthe period on interest-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nbearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.98%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.92%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.87%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBrokered CDs - Historically, a large portion of the Corporation's funding has been brokered CDs issued by FirstBank. Total brokered CDs decreased during 2018 by $594.9 million to $555.6 million as of December 31, 2018.\nThe average remaining term to maturity of the retail brokered CDs outstanding as of December 31, 2018 was approximately 1.3 years.\nThe use of brokered CDs has historically been important for the growth of the Corporation. The Corporation encounters intense competition in attracting and retaining regular retail deposits in Puerto Rico. The brokered CD market is very competitive and liquid, and has enabled the Corporation to obtain substantial amounts of funding in short periods of time. This strategy has enhanced the Corporation's liquidity position, since brokered CDs are insured by the FDIC up to regulatory limits and can be obtained faster than regular retail deposits.\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> The following table presents contractual maturities of time deposits with denominations of $100,000 or higher as of December 31, 2018:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Three months or less\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 386,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Over three months to six months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 288,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Over six months to one year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 547,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Over one year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 994,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,217,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertificates of deposit in denominations of $100,000 or higher include brokered CDs of $555.6 million issued to deposit brokers in the form of large certificates of deposit that are generally participated out by brokers in shares of less than the FDIC insurance limit.\nGovernment deposits - As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $677.3 million of Puerto Rico public sector deposits ($544.6 million in transactional accounts and $132.7 million in time deposits), compared to $490.3 million as of December 31, 2017. Approximately 34% is from municipalities and municipal agencies in Puerto Rico and 66% is from public corporations and the central government and agencies.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $223.4 million of government deposits in the Virgin Islands, compared to $161.7 million as of December 31, 2017.\nRetail deposits - The Corporation's deposit products also include regular saving accounts, demand deposit accounts, money market accounts and retail CDs. Total deposits, excluding brokered CDs and government deposits, increased by $318.2 million to $7.5 billion from a balance of $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. The higher balance reflects increases of $304.7 million and $88.4 million in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, respectively, partially offset by a $75.0 million decrease in Florida. After the hurricanes and during 2018, the Corporation experienced rapid accumulation of deposits. Total deposits as of December 31, 2018, excluding brokered CDs and government deposits, increased $318.2 million from December 31, 2017 and $695.2 million since September 30, 2017. The most significant increase was in non-interest-bearing demand deposits, which grew 31%, or $561.8 million, between December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and 51%, or $809.3 million, between September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Hurricane-related factors, such as the effect of disaster relief funds and settlement of insurance claims, contributed to this growth. Although management expects the balances accumulated by deposit customers in the hurricane-affected areas to reduce over time, it is difficult to predict when and to what degree, and there may be further growth as insurance claims are resolved and additional disaster-recovery funds are distributed.

The Corporation's outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements amounted to $350.1 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $500 million as of December 31, 2017. The Corporation repaid in the first quarter of 2018 a $100 million short-term repurchase agreement carried at a cost of 1.53%. In addition, during the third quarter of 2018, the Corporation repaid a $100 million long-term repurchase agreement called before its contractual maturity, which had an interest rate of 1.96%. One of the Corporation's strategies has been the use of structured repurchase agreements and long-term repurchase agreements to reduce liquidity risk and manage exposure to interest rate risk by lengthening the final maturities of its liabilities while keeping funding costs at reasonable levels. In addition to these repurchase agreements, the Corporation has been able to maintain access to credit by using cost-effective sources such as FHLB advances. See Note 17, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase,\u201d in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details about repurchase agreements outstanding by counterparty and maturities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $200 million of reverse repurchase agreements with a counterparty under a master netting arrangement that provides for a right of setoff that meets the conditions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 210-20-45-11 for a net presentation. These repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are presented net on the consolidated statement of financial condition.\nUnder the Corporation's repurchase agreements, as is the case with derivative contracts, the Corporation is required to pledge cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements. To the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines due to changes in interest rates, a liquidity crisis or any other factor, the Corporation is required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements, thereby adversely affecting its liquidity.\nGiven the quality of the collateral pledged, the Corporation has not experienced margin calls from counterparties arising from credit-quality-related write-downs in valuations.\nAdvances from the FHLB - The Bank is a member of the FHLB system and obtains advances to fund its operations under a collateral agreement with the FHLB that requires the Bank to maintain qualifying mortgages and/or investments as collateral for advances taken. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of FHLB advances was $740.0 million, compared to $715.0 million as of December 31, 2017. During 2018, the Corporation repaid at maturity $95.0 million of fixed-rate advances from the FHLB carried at an average cost of 1.63%, offset by new 3-Year advances entered into in 2018 totaling $120.0 million with an average cost of 2.65%. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $422.2 million available for additional credit on FHLB lines of credit.\nTrust-Preferred Securities - In 2004, FBP Statutory Trust I, a statutory trust that is wholly-owned by the Corporation and not consolidated in the Corporation's financial statements, sold to institutional investors $100 million of its variable-rate trust-preferred securities. FBP Statutory Trust I used the proceeds of the issuance, together with the proceeds of the purchase by the Corporation of $3.1 million of FBP Statutory Trust I variable rate common securities, to purchase $103.1 million aggregate principal amount of the Corporation's Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures.\nAlso in 2004, FBP Statutory Trust II, a statutory trust that is wholly-owned by the Corporation and not consolidated in the Corporation's financial statements, sold to institutional investors $125 million of its variable-rate trust-preferred securities. FBP Statutory Trust II used the proceeds of the issuance, together with the proceeds of the purchase by the Corporation of $3.9 million of FBP Statutory Trust II variable rate common securities, to purchase $128.9 million aggregate principal amount of the Corporation's Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures.\nThe trust-preferred debentures are presented in the Corporation's consolidated statement of financial condition as Other Borrowings. The variable-rate trust-preferred securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation. The $100 million Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures issued by the Corporation in April 2004 and the $125 million issued in September 2004 mature on June 17, 2034 and September 20, 2034, respectively; however, under certain circumstances, the maturity of the subordinated debentures may be shortened (such shortening would result in a mandatory redemption of the variable-rate trust-preferred securities). The Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated certain trust-preferred securities from Tier 1 Capital. Bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, were required to fully phase out these instruments from Tier I capital by January 1, 2016; however, they may remain in Tier 2 capital until the instruments are redeemed or mature.\nAs mentioned above, during the first quarter of 2018, the Corporation completed the repurchase of $23.8 million of trust-preferred securities of the FBP Statutory Trust I that were being auctioned in a public sale at which the Corporation was invited to participate. The Corporation repurchased and cancelled the repurchased trust-preferred securities, which resulted in a commensurate reduction in the related subordinated debenture. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation still had subordinated debentures outstanding in the aggregate amount of $184.2 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, the Corporation received approval from the Federal Reserve and paid $31.2 million for all the accrued but deferred interest payments, plus the interest for the 2016 second quarter, on the Corporation's subordinated debentures associated with its trust-preferred securities. Subsequently, the Corporation has received quarterly regulatory approvals and made scheduled quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation was current on all interest payments due related to its subordinated debentures. On October 3, 2017, the New York FED terminated the Written Agreement entered into on June 3, 2010 between the Corporation and the Federal Reserve. However, the Corporation has agreed with its regulators to continue to obtain approval before paying dividends, receiving dividends from the Bank, making payments on subordinated debt or trust-preferred securities, incurring or guaranteeing debt or purchasing or redeeming any corporate stock. The Corporation has received approval to make the subordinated debentures' quarterly payment through December 2019, subject to conditions established in the agreement with regulators.\nOther Sources of Funds and Liquidity - The Corporation's principal uses of funds are for the origination of loans and the repayment of maturing deposits and borrowings. In connection with its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation has invested in technology and personnel to enhance the Corporation's secondary mortgage market capabilities.\nThe enhanced capabilities improve the Corporation's liquidity profile as they allow the Corporation to derive liquidity, if needed, from the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market. The U.S. (including Puerto Rico) secondary mortgage market is still highly liquid, in large part because of the sale of mortgages through guarantee programs of the FHA, VA, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD\u201d), FNMA and FHLMC. During 2018, the Corporation sold approximately $233.2 million of FHA/VA mortgage loans to GNMA, which packages them into mortgage-backed securities. Any regulatory actions affecting GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC could adversely affect the secondary mortgage market.\nAlthough currently not in use, other potential sources of short-term funding for the Corporation include commercial paper and federal funds purchased. Furthermore, in previous years, the Corporation entered into several financing transactions to diversify its funding sources, including the issuance of notes payable and, as noted above, junior subordinated debentures as part of its longer-term liquidity and capital management activities. No assurance can be given that these sources of liquidity will be available in the future and, if available, will be on comparable terms.\nEffect of Credit Ratings on Access to Liquidity\nThe Corporation's liquidity is contingent upon its ability to obtain external sources of funding to finance its operations. The Corporation's current credit ratings and any further downgrade in credit ratings can hinder the Corporation's access to new forms of external funding and/or cause external funding to be more expensive, which could in turn adversely affect results of operations. Also, changes in credit ratings may further affect the fair value of unsecured derivatives that consider the Corporation's own credit risk as part of the valuation.\nThe Corporation does not have any outstanding debt or derivative agreements that would be affected by credit downgrades. Furthermore, given the Corporation's non-reliance on corporate debt or other instruments directly linked in terms of pricing or volume\nto credit ratings, the liquidity of the Corporation so far has not been affected in any material way by downgrades. The Corporation's ability to access new non-deposit sources of funding, however, could be adversely affected by credit downgrades.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Corporation's credit as a long-term issuer was rated B+ by S&P and B by Fitch. At the FirstBank subsidiary level, long-term issuer ratings as of December 31, 2018 were Caa1 by Moody's, seven notches below their definition of investment grade, B+ by S&P, four notches below their definition of investment grade, and B by Fitch, six notches below their definition of investment grade. The Corporation's credit ratings are dependent on a number of factors, both quantitative and qualitative, and are subject to change at any time. The disclosure of credit ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Corporation's securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nCash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $586.2 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $130.2 million when compared to the balance as of December 31, 2017. The following discussion highlights the major activities and transactions that affected the Corporation's cash flows during 2018 and 2017:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFirst BanCorp.'s operating assets and liabilities vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows. Management believes cash flows from operations, available cash balances and the Corporation's ability to generate cash through short- and long-term borrowings will be sufficient to fund the Corporation's operating liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.\nFor 2018 and 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $288.3 million and $236.0 million, respectively. Net cash generated from operating activities was higher than reported net income largely as a result of adjustments for items such as the provision for loan and lease losses, depreciation and amortization, and impairments, as well as the cash generated from sales of loans held for sale.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe Corporation's investing activities primarily relate to originating loans to be held for investment and the purchasing, selling and repaying of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $223.3 million, primarily reflecting the effect of purchases of U.S. agencies' debt and mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by U.S. agencies MBS prepayments and proceeds from the aforementioned sales of adversely-classified commercial loans and seasoned residential mortgage loans.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $73.3 million, primarily reflecting the effect of purchases of investment securities completed during 2017.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe Corporation's financing activities primarily include the receipt of deposits and the issuance of brokered CDs, the issuance and payments on long-term debt, the issuance of equity instruments and activities related to its short-term funding. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used by financing activities was $195.3 million, mainly reflecting the effect of the repayment of maturing brokered CDs and borrowings, dividends paid on common and preferred stock, and the cash used for the repurchase and cancellation of trust-preferred securities, partially offset by the increase in non-brokered deposits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $254.0 million, mainly due to the increase in non-brokered deposits and higher reliance on FHLB advances, partially offset by the repayment of maturing brokered CDs, dividends paid on preferred stock, and the cash used for the repurchase and cancellation of trust-preferred securities.\nCapital\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Corporation's stockholders' equity was $2.0 billion, an increase of $175.6 million from December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly driven by the earnings generated in 2018, partially offset by the decrease in the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities recorded as part of other comprehensive loss in total equity and dividends paid on preferred and common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2018, for the first time since June 2009, the Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per common share, or an aggregate $6.5 million. On December 31, 2016, for the first time since July 2009, the Corporation paid dividends on its non-cumulative perpetual monthly income preferred stock, after receiving regulatory approval. Since then, the Corporation has continued to pay monthly dividend payments on the non-cumulative perpetual monthly income preferred stock. As mentioned above, on October 3, 2017, the Federal Reserve terminated the Written Agreement entered into on June\n3, 2010 between the Corporation and the Federal Reserve. However, the Corporation has agreed with its regulators to continue to obtain approval before paying dividends, receiving dividends from the Bank, making payments on subordinated debt or trust-preferred securities, incurring or guaranteeing debt or purchasing or redeeming any corporate stock. The Corporation received regulatory approvals to pay the monthly dividends on the Corporation's Series A through E Preferred Stock and quarterly dividends on the common stocks through December 2019, subject to conditions established in the agreement with regulators. The Corporation intends to request approval in future periods to continue to pay monthly dividend payments on the non-cumulative perpetual monthly income preferred stock and quarterly dividends on common stock.\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Set forth below are First BanCorp.'s and FirstBank's regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Banking Subsidiary\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> To be well capitalized\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First BanCorp.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> FirstBank\n</td> <td> - General thresholds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fully\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fully\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Phased-in (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Phased-in (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital ratio (Total capital to risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td> 24.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.51%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.02%\n</td> <td> 10.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td> 20.30%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.86%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.76%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.35%\n</td> <td> 6.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 capital ratio (Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td> 20.71%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.26%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.76%\n</td> <td> 8.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage ratio\n</td> <td> 15.37%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.37%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.53%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.53%\n</td> <td> 5.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Banking Subsidiary\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> To be well capitalized\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First BanCorp.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> FirstBank\n</td> <td> - General thresholds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fully\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fully\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Phased-in (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Phased-in (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital ratio (Total capital to risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td> 22.53%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.06%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.53%\n</td> <td> 10.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td> 18.96%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.09%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.70%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.86%\n</td> <td> 6.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 capital ratio (Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td> 18.97%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.49%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.79%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.26%\n</td> <td> 8.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage ratio\n</td> <td> 14.03%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.01%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.39%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.37%\n</td> <td> 5.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Certain adjustments required under Basel III rules were phased-in through the end of 2018 although certain elements of the Basel III rules have recently been deferred by the federal banking agencies.

Certain elements of the new rules have been deferred by the federal banking agencies. The Corporation and FirstBank compute risk-weighted assets using the Standardized Approach required by the Basel III rules.\nThe Basel III rules require the Corporation to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% to avoid limitations on both (i) capital distributions (e.g., repurchases of capital instruments, dividends and interest payments on capital instruments) and (ii) discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and heads of major business lines. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 with a first year requirement of 0.625% of additional Common Equity Tier 1 capital ( CET1\u201d), which is being progressively increased, by that same percentage amount on each subsequent January 1 until it reached the fully phased-in 2.5% CET1 requirement on January 1, 2019.\nUnder the fully phased-in Basel III rules, in order to be considered adequately capitalized, the Corporation will be required to maintain: (i) a minimum CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer,\u201d resulting in a required minimum CET1 ratio of at least 7%; (ii) a minimum ratio of total Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, resulting in a required minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; (iii) a minimum ratio of total Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, resulting in a required minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%; and (iv) a required minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average on-balance sheet (non-risk adjusted) assets.\nIn addition, as required under the Basel III rules, the Corporation's trust-preferred securities ( TRUPs\u201d) were fully phased out from Tier 1 capital as of January 1, 2016. However, the Corporation's TRUPs may continue to be included in Tier 2 capital until the instruments are redeemed or mature.\nOn November 21, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency finalized an extension of the phase-in of certain Basel III capital rules for banks not using the Basel advanced approaches capital rule. The extension, which was effective on January 1, 2018, pauses the full transition to the Basel III treatment of mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interests, pending the banking agencies' broader efforts, announced in September 2017, to simplify the regulatory capital rules that apply to banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rules. Because the advanced approaches rules apply to banking organizations with more than $250 billion in assets or foreign bank subsidiaries with more than $10 billion in assets, the extension relief applies broadly to community, midsize, and regional banks, including the Corporation and FirstBank.\nThe tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures generally used by the financial community to evaluate capital adequacy. Tangible common equity is total equity less preferred equity, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, purchased credit card relationship asset and insurance customer relationship intangible asset. Tangible assets are total assets less goodwill, core deposit intangibles, purchased credit card relationship and insurance customer relationship intangible assets.

Amounts transferred to the legal surplus reserve from the retained earnings account are not available for distribution to the Corporation, including for payment as dividends to the stockholders, without the prior consent of the Puerto Rico Commissioner of Financial Institutions. The Puerto Rico Banking Law provides that, when the expenditures of a Puerto Rico commercial bank are greater than receipts, the excess of the expenditures over receipts must be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the legal surplus reserve, as a reduction thereof. If there is no legal surplus reserve sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and the Bank cannot pay dividends until it can replenish the legal surplus reserve to an amount of at least 20% of the original capital contributed. During 2018 and 2017, $20.5 million and $7.3 million, respectively, were transferred to the legal surplus reserve. FirstBank's legal surplus reserve, included as part of retained earnings in the Corporation's statement of financial condition, amounted to $80.2 million and $59.7 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation engages in financial transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet, or may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers; (2) manage the Corporation's credit, market or liquidity risks; (3) diversify the Corporation's funding sources; and (4) optimize capital.\nAs a provider of financial services, the Corporation routinely enters into commitments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financial needs of its customers. These financial instruments may include loan commitments and standby letters of credit. These commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process used for on-balance sheet instruments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial position. As of December 31, 2018, commitments to extend credit amounted to approximately $1.4 billion, of which $680.9 million related to credit card loans. Commercial and financial standby letters of credit amounted to approximately $72.5 million.\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr>

under other commitments to sell mortgage loans at fair value and to extend credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Other contractual obligations result mainly from contracts for the rental and maintenance of equipment. Since certain commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. For most of the commercial lines of credit, the Corporation has the option to reevaluate the agreement prior to additional disbursements. There have been no significant or unexpected draws on existing commitments. In the case of credit cards and personal lines of credit, the Corporation can cancel the unused credit facility at any time and without cause.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nFirst BanCorp. manages its asset/liability position in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income and to maintain stability of profitability under varying interest rate scenarios. The MIALCO oversees interest rate risk, and, in doing so, the MIALCO assesses, among other things, current and expected conditions in world financial markets, competition and prevailing rates in the local deposit market, liquidity, the pipeline of loan originations, securities market values, recent or proposed changes to the investment portfolio, alternative funding sources and related costs, hedging and the possible purchase of derivatives, such as swaps and caps, and any tax or regulatory issues that may be pertinent to these areas. The MIALCO approves funding decisions in light of the Corporation's overall strategies and objectives.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Corporation performs a consolidated net interest income simulation analysis to estimate the potential change in future earnings from projected changes in interest rates. These simulations are carried out over a one-to-five-year time horizon and assume upward and downward yield curve shifts. The rate scenarios considered in these simulations reflect gradual upward and downward interest rate movements of 200 basis points during a twelve-month period. Simulations are carried out in two ways:\n(1) Using a static balance sheet, as the Corporation had on the simulation date, and\n(2) Using a dynamic balance sheet based on recent patterns and current strategies.\nThe balance sheet is divided into groups of assets and liabilities by maturity or re-pricing structure and their corresponding interest yields and costs. As interest rates rise or fall, these simulations incorporate expected future lending rates, current and expected future funding sources and costs, the possible exercise of options, changes in prepayment rates, deposit decay and other factors, which may be important in projecting net interest income.\nThe Corporation uses a simulation model to project future movements in the Corporation's balance sheet and income statement. The starting point of the projections corresponds to the actual values on the balance sheet on the date of the simulations.\nThese simulations are highly complex, and are based on many assumptions that are intended to reflect the general behavior of the balance sheet components over the period in question. It is unlikely that actual events will match these assumptions in most cases. For this reason, the results of these forward-looking computations are only approximations of the true sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Several benchmark and market rate curves were used in the modeling process, primarily the LIBOR/SWAP curve, Prime, Treasury, FHLB rates, brokered CD rates, repurchase agreement rates and the mortgage commitment rate of 30 years.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the 12-month net interest income is forecasted assuming the December 31, 2018 interest rate curves remain constant. Then, net interest income is estimated under rising and falling rate scenarios. For the rising rate scenario, a gradual (ramp) parallel upward shift of the yield curve is assumed during the first 12 months (the +200 ramp\u201d scenario). Conversely, for the falling rate scenario, a gradual (ramp) parallel downward shift of the yield curve is assumed during the first 12 months (the -200 ramp\u201d scenario). However, given the current low levels of interest rates, a full downward shift of 200 basis points would represent an unrealistic scenario. Therefore, under the falling rate scenario, rates move downward up to 200 basis points, but without reaching zero. The resulting scenario shows interest rates close to zero in most cases, reflecting a flattening yield curve instead of a parallel downward scenario.\nThe Libor/Swap curve for December 31, 2018, as compared to December 2017, reflected a 99 basis point increase in the short-term horizon, between 1 to 12 months, while market rates increased by 42 basis points in the medium term, that is, between 2 to 5 years. In the long-term, that is, over a 5-year time horizon, market rates increased by 31 basis points, causing a more flattened yield curve. The U.S. Treasury curve in the short-term increased by 103 basis points and in the medium-term horizon increased by 40 basis points as compared to the December 2017 end of month levels. The long-term horizon increased by 29 basis points as compared to December 2017 end of month levels.\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> The following table presents the results of the simulations as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

As of December 31, 2018, the simulations showed that the Corporation maintained an asset-sensitive position. The Corporation has continued repositioning the balance sheet and improving the funding mix, driven by an increase in the average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits and reductions in brokered CDs, repurchase agreements and other borrowings. The above-mentioned growth in non-interest-bearing deposits, along with proceeds from US agencies mortgage-backed securities and loan repayments, has helped the Corporation continue to maintain high liquidity levels.\nTaking into consideration the above-mentioned facts for modeling purposes, the net interest income for the next 12 months under a non-static balance sheet scenario is estimated to increase by $8.7 million in the rising rate scenario when compared against the Corporation's flat or unchanged interest rate forecast scenario. Under the falling rate, non-static scenario, net interest income is estimated to decrease by $9.1 million.\nDerivatives\nFirst BanCorp. uses derivative instruments and other strategies to manage its exposure to interest rate risk caused by changes in interest rates that are beyond management's control.\nThe following summarizes major strategies, including derivative activities that the Corporation uses in managing interest rate risk:\nInterest rate cap agreements - Interest rate cap agreements provide the right to receive cash if a reference interest rate rises above a contractual rate. The value increases as the reference interest rate rises. The Corporation enters into interest rate cap agreements for protection from rising interest rates.\nForward Contracts - Forward contracts are sales of TBAs that will settle over the standard delivery date and do not qualify as regular-way\u201d security trades. Regular-way security trades are contracts that have no net settlement provision and no market mechanism to facilitate net settlement and that provide for delivery of a security within the timeframe generally established by regulations or conventions in the market place or exchange in which the transaction is being executed. The forward sales are considered derivative instruments that need to be marked-to-market. These securities are used to economically hedge the FHA/VA residential mortgage loan securitizations of the mortgage-banking operations. Also reported as forward contracts are mandatory mortgage loan sales commitments entered into with GSEs that require or permit net settlement via a pair-off transaction or the payment of a pair-off fee. Unrealized gains (losses) are recognized as part of mortgage banking activities in the consolidated statements of income.\nFor detailed information regarding the volume of derivative activities (e.g., notional amounts), location and fair values of derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of financial condition and the amount of gains and losses reported in the consolidated statements of income, see Note 33, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,\u201d of the Corporation's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> The following tables summarize the fair value changes in the Corporation's derivatives as well as the sources of the fair values:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Asset Derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Liability Derivatives\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (324)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (149)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in fair value during the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (527)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,000)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> Sources of Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity Less Than One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity in Excess of 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pricing from observable market inputs - Asset Derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pricing from observable market inputs - Liability Derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (383)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (529)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,000)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDerivative instruments, such as interest rate caps, are subject to market risk. As is the case with investment securities, the market value of derivative instruments is largely a function of the financial market's expectations regarding the future direction of interest rates. Accordingly, current market values are not necessarily indicative of the future impact of derivative instruments on earnings. This will depend, for the most part, on the level of interest rates, as well as the expectations for rates in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, all of the derivative instruments held by the Corporation were considered undesignated economic hedges.\nThe use of derivatives involves market and credit risk. The market risk of derivatives stems principally from the potential for changes in the value of derivative contracts based on changes in interest rates. The credit risk of derivatives arises from the potential for default of the counterparty. To manage this credit risk, the Corporation deals with counterparties of good credit standing, enters into master netting agreements whenever possible and, when appropriate, obtains collateral. Master netting agreements incorporate rights of set-off that provide for the net settlement of contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default.\nCredit Risk Management\nFirst BanCorp. is subject to credit risk mainly with respect to its portfolio of loans receivable and off-balance-sheet instruments, mainly derivatives and loan commitments. Loans receivable represents loans that First BanCorp. holds for investment and, therefore, First BanCorp. is at risk for the term of the loan. Loan commitments represent commitments to extend credit, subject to specific conditions, for specific amounts and maturities. These commitments may expose the Corporation to credit risk and are subject to the same review and approval process as for loans made by the Bank. See Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d above for further details. The credit risk of derivatives arises from the potential that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations. To manage this credit risk, the Corporation deals with counterparties of good credit standing, enters into master netting agreements whenever possible and, when appropriate, obtains collateral. For further details and information on the Corporation's derivative credit risk exposure, see Interest Rate Risk Management,\u201d above. The Corporation manages its credit risk through its credit policy, underwriting, independent loan review and quality control procedures, statistical analysis, comprehensive financial analysis, and established management committees. The Corporation also employs proactive collection and loss mitigation efforts. Furthermore, personnel performing structured loan workout functions are responsible for mitigating defaults and minimizing losses upon default within each region and for each business segment. In the case of the commercial and industrial ( C&I\u201d), commercial mortgage and construction loan portfolios, the Special Asset Group ( SAG\u201d) focuses on strategies for the accelerated reduction of non-performing assets through note sales, short sales, loss mitigation programs, and sales of OREO. In addition to the management of the resolution process for problem loans, the SAG oversees collection efforts for all loans to prevent migration to the nonccrual and/or adversely classified status. The SAG utilizes relationship officers, collection specialists and attorneys. In the case of residential construction projects, the workout function monitors project specifics, such as project management and marketing, as deemed necessary.\nThe Corporation may also have risk of default in the securities portfolio. The securities held by the Corporation are principally fixed-rate U.S. agencies mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury and agency securities. Thus, a substantial portion of these instruments is backed by mortgages, a guarantee of a U.S. government-sponsored entity or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\nManagement, consisting of the Corporation's Commercial Credit Risk Officer, Retail Credit Risk Officer, Chief Lending Officer and other senior executives, has the primary responsibility for setting strategies to achieve the Corporation's credit risk goals and objectives. These goals and objectives are documented in the Corporation's Credit Policy.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Non-performing Assets\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses represents the estimate of the level of reserves appropriate to absorb inherent incurred credit losses. The amount of the allowance is determined by empirical analysis and judgments regarding the quality of each individual loan portfolio. All known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability are considered, including analyses of historical charge-off experience, migration patterns, changes in economic conditions, and changes in loan collateral values. For example, factors affecting the economies of Puerto Rico, Florida (USA), the USVI and the BVI may contribute to delinquencies and defaults above the Corporation's historical loan and lease losses. Such factors are subject to regular review and may change to reflect updated performance trends and expectations, particularly in times of severe stress. The process includes judgments and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses provides for probable incurred losses that have been identified with specific valuation allowances for individually evaluated impaired loans and probable incurred losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio that have not been specifically identified. An internal risk rating is assigned to each business loan at the time of approval and is subject to subsequent periodic reviews by the Corporation's senior management. The allowance for loan and lease losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis as part of the Corporation's continued evaluation of its asset quality.\nHurricanes Maria and Irma caused widespread property damage, flooding, power outages, and water and communication services interruptions, and severely disrupted normal economic activity in the affected areas. The methodologies used by the Corporation to determine the hurricane-related qualitative reserve estimates and for the review of individual large commercial credits are discussed in detail in Note 1, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, which are included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and in Results of Operations - Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d above. With the ongoing collection of information on individual commercial customers and statistics on the consumer and residential loan portfolios, the loss estimate was revised during 2018 and will be revised in the future as needed.\nThe ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans held for investment was 2.22% as of December 31, 2018, compared to 2.62% as of December 31, 2017. The change for each portfolio follows:\n\u00b7 The allowance to total loans ratio for the residential mortgage portfolio decreased from 1.79% as of December 31, 2017 to 1.61% as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower nonaccrual and delinquency loan levels.\n\u00b7 The allowance to total loans ratio for the commercial mortgage portfolio increased from 3.00% as of December 31, 2017 to 3.65% as of December 31, 2018, driven by the effect of the downgrade in the credit risk classification of three large loans totaling $110.4 million.\n\u00b7 The allowance to total loans for the C&I portfolio decreased from 2.35% as of December 31, 2017 to 1.52% as of December 31, 2018, reflecting the effect of a $5.5 million net loan loss reserve release related to revised estimates of the qualitative reserve associated with the effects of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, primarily due to updated assessments about the performance and repayment prospects of certain individually assessed commercial loans, charge-offs taken against previously-established reserves, and reserve releases related to the upgrade in the credit risk classification of certain loans.\n\u00b7 The allowance to total loans for the construction loan portfolio increased from 4.06% as of December 31, 2017 to 4.52% as of December 31, 2018, reflecting the effect of the sale in 2018 of a $27.0 million nonaccrual construction loan that carried a specific reserve of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2017.\n\u00b7 The allowance to total loans for the consumer loan portfolio decreased from 4.06% as of December 31, 2017 to 2.77% as of December 31, 2018, reflecting the effect of both $10.9 million of consumer loan charge-offs taken against previously-established hurricane-related qualitative reserves and hurricane-related qualitative reserve releases of $8.4 million resulting from payments received during 2018 that reduced the balance of the consumer loan portfolio outstanding on the dates of the hurricanes and updated payment patterns and credit risk analyses applied to consumer borrowers that were subject to payment deferral programs that expired early in 2018.\nThe ratio of the total allowance to nonaccrual loans held for investment was 62.15% as of December 31, 2018 compared to 47.36% as of December 31, 2017, reflecting the effect of the $173.6 million decrease in nonaccrual loans held for investment, driven by the aforementioned transfers to held for sale of nonaccrual commercial and construction loans totaling $74.4 million (net of fair value write-downs of $22.2 million), including $57.2 million in nonaccrual commercial mortgage loans that were eventually sold.\nSubstantially all of the Corporation's loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is located in Puerto Rico, the USVI or BVI or the U.S. mainland (mainly in the state of Florida), the performance of the Corporation's loan portfolio and the value of the collateral supporting the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific area's real estate market. The real estate market in Puerto Rico experienced readjustments in value driven by reduced demand and general adverse economic conditions that were exacerbated by the effects of Hurricanes Maria and Irma. The Corporation sets adequate loan-to-value ratios following its regulatory and credit policy standards.\nAs shown in the following table, the allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to $196.4 million as of December 31, 2018, or 2.22% of total loans, compared with $231.8 million, or 2.62% of total loans, as of December 31, 2017.

When a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, any interest previously recognized and not collected is reversed and charged against interest income. Cash payments received on certain loans that are impaired and collateral-dependent are recognized when collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the loans. The principal portion of the payment is used to reduce the principal balance of the loan, whereas the interest portion is recognized on a cash basis (when collected). However, when management believes that the ultimate collectability of principal is in doubt, the interest portion is applied to the outstanding principal. The risk exposure of this portfolio is diversified as to individual borrowers and industries, among other factors. In addition, a large portion is secured with real estate collateral.\nNonaccrual Loans Policy\nResidential Real Estate Loans - The Corporation classifies real estate loans in nonaccrual status when interest and principal have not been received for a period of 90 days or more.\nCommercial and Construction Loans - The Corporation places commercial loans (including commercial real estate and construction loans) in nonaccrual status when interest and principal have not been received for a period of 90 days or more or when collection of all of the principal or interest is not expected due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower.\nFinance Leases - Finance leases are classified in nonaccrual status when interest and principal have not been received for a period of 90 days or more.\nConsumer Loans - Consumer loans are classified in nonaccrual status when interest and principal have not been received for a period of 90 days or more. Credit card loans continue to accrue finance charges and fees until charged-off at 180 days delinquent.\nPurchased Credit Impaired Loans - PCI loans were recorded at fair value at acquisition. Since the initial fair value of these loans included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, the subsequent accounting for PCI loans differs from the accounting for non-PCI loans. The Corporation, therefore, separately tracks and reports PCI loans and excludes these from the amounts of nonaccrual loans, impaired loans, TDR loans, and non-performing assets.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOREO acquired in settlement of loans is carried at the lower of cost (carrying value of the loan) or fair value less estimated costs to sell off the real estate. Appraisals are obtained periodically, generally on an annual basis.\nOther Repossessed Property\nThe other repossessed property category generally includes repossessed boats and autos acquired in settlement of loans. Repossessed boats and autos are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value.\nOther Non-Performing Assets\nThis category consisted of bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority prior to the sale of these non-performing bonds in the second quarter of 2017. These bonds were previously held by the Corporation as part of its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.\nPast-Due Loans 90 days and still accruing\nThese are accruing loans that are contractually delinquent 90 days or more. These past-due loans are either current as to interest but delinquent as to the payment of principal or are insured or guaranteed under applicable FHA, VA or other government-guaranteed programs for residential mortgage loans. Past due loans 90 days and still accruing also include PCI loans with individual delinquencies over 90 days, primarily related to mortgage loans acquired from Doral Bank in 2015 and from Doral Financial in 2014.\nTDRs are classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans. A loan on nonaccrual and restructured as a TDR will remain on nonaccrual status until the borrower has proven the ability to perform under the modified structure, generally for a minimum of six months, and there is evidence that such payments can and are likely to continue as agreed. Performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are included in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may\nresult in the loans being returned to accrual status at the time of the restructuring or after a shorter performance period. If the borrower's ability to meet the revised payment schedule is uncertain, the loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan.\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> The following table presents

This represents a decrease of $165.7 million from $497.8 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in nonaccrual loans was primarily attributable to: (i) the restoration to accrual status of two large commercial loans totaling $69.7 million, including a $34 million commercial mortgage loan that was restructured through a loan split in the second quarter of 2018 and paid off during the fourth quarter of 2018; (ii) sales of nonaccrual commercial and construction loans held for sale of $61.9 million; (iii) collections on commercial and construction nonaccrual loans of $32.3 million; (iv) commercial and construction nonaccrual loan charge-offs totaling $40.3 million; and (v) a $31.0 million decrease in residential nonaccrual loans.

The decrease was primarily related to the aforementioned $34 million commercial mortgage loan restructured and paid off in 2018, sales of $27.2 million of nonaccrual commercial mortgage loans, collections on nonaccrual commercial mortgage loans of $17.5 million, and commercial mortgage nonaccrual loan charge-offs of $23.8 million. These variances were partially offset by the aforementioned inflow in 2018 of two large commercial mortgage loans totaling $69.8 million related to a legacy commercial loan relationship that operates in both the Florida and Puerto Rico regions. Total inflows of nonaccrual commercial mortgage loans held for investment amounted to $78.6 million during 2018, compared to $55.8 million in 2017.\nNonaccrual C&I loans, including nonaccrual C&I loans held for sale, decreased by $53.7 million to $32.1 million as of December 31, 2018 from $85.8 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily related to the restoration to accrual status of a $35.7 million commercial and industrial loan as the borrower had demonstrated sustained performance for an extended period and principal and interest is deemed fully collectible, collections on nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans of $9.0 million, and commercial and industrial nonaccrual loan charge-offs of $8.2 million. Total inflows of nonaccrual C&I loans held for investment were $5.2 million during 2018, compared to $25.6 million in 2017.\nNonaccrual construction loans, including nonaccrual construction loans held for sale, decreased by $49.0 million to $11.4 million as of December 31, 2018 from $60.4 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of $34.7 million of nonaccrual construction loans, construction nonaccrual loan charge-offs of $8.3 million, and collections on nonaccrual construction loans of $4.8 million. Total inflows of nonaccrual construction loans held for investment amounted to $1.7 million during 2018, compared to $10.1 million in 2017.\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> The

decrease of $108.1 million compared to $244.7 million as of December 31, 2017. The variances by major portfolio categories is as follow:\n\u00b7 Consumer loans in early delinquency decreased by $51.7 million to $59.5 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $111.2 million as of December 31, 2017, and residential mortgage loans in early delinquency decreased by $42.7 million to $73.2 million as of December 31, 2018, from $115.9 million as of December 31, 2017. These variances primarily reflect both the resumption of payments by clients after the expiration of the three-month payment deferral programs offered to hurricane-affected borrowers and the classification of loans as non-performing during 2018.\n\u00b7 Commercial and construction loans in early delinquency decreased by $13.8 million to $3.9 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $17.7 million as of December 31, 2017, primarily due to loans brought current.\nThe Corporation provides homeownership preservation assistance to its customers through a loss mitigation program in Puerto Rico that is similar to the U.S. government's Home Affordable Modification Program guidelines. Depending upon the nature of borrowers' financial condition, restructurings or loan modifications through this program, as well as other restructurings of individual commercial, commercial mortgage, construction, and residential mortgage loans, fit the definition of a TDR. A restructuring of a debt constitutes a TDR if the creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. Modifications involve changes in one or more of the loan terms that bring a defaulted loan current and provide sustainable affordability. Changes may include, among others, the extension of the maturity of the loan and modifications of the loan rate. See Note 8, Loans Held for Investment,\u201d in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, which are included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for additional information and statistics about the Corporation's TDR loans.\nTDR loans are classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans. Loans in accrual status may remain in accrual status when their contractual terms have been modified in a TDR if the loans had demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms is expected. Otherwise, loans on nonaccrual and restructured as a TDR will remain on nonaccrual status until the borrower has proven the ability to perform under the modified structure, generally for a minimum of six months, and there is evidence that such payments can, and are likely to, continue as agreed. Performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are included in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to accrual status at the time of the restructuring or after a shorter performance period. If the borrower's ability to meet the revised payment schedule is uncertain, the loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan. Loan modifications increase the Corporation's interest income by returning a nonaccrual loan to performing status, if applicable, increase cash flows by providing for payments to be made by the borrower, and limit increases in foreclosure and OREO costs.\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> The following table provides a breakdown between accrual and nonaccrual TDRs:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Accrual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Nonaccrual (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total TDRs\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-FHA/VA Residential Mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 271,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 333,902\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Commercial Mortgage loans (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 116,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 137,949\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Commercial and Industrial loans (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,921\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Construction loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConstruction - Land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,765\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConstruction - Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConstruction - Residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Consumer loans - Auto\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,031\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Finance leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,935\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Consumer loans - Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,382\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal Troubled Debt Restructurings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 478,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 582,647\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Included in nonaccrual loans are $17.7 million in loans that are performing under the terms of the restructuring agreement but are reported in nonaccrual status until the restructured loans meet the criteria of sustained payment performance under the revised terms for reinstatement to accrual status and are deemed fully collectible.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Excludes commercial mortgage TDR loans held for sale amounting to $11.1 million as of December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Excludes commercial and industrial TDR loans held for sale amounting to $0.9 million as of December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe OREO portfolio, which is part of non-performing assets, decreased by $16.5 million to $131.4 million as of December 31, 2018 from $147.9 million as of December 31, 2017.

Net charge-offs for 2018 included charge-offs totaling $22.2 million associated with the transfer to held for sale of $74.4 million in nonaccrual commercial and construction loans. Net charge-offs for 2017 included a $10.7 million charge-off associated with the sale of the PREPA credit line.\nCommercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in 2018 were $16.0 million, or 1.03% of average commercial mortgage loans, compared to $38.8 million, or 2.42%, for 2017. Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs during 2018 included $13.8 million associated with the transfer to held for sale of $39.6 million in nonaccrual commercial mortgage loans. In addition, the Corporation recorded a loan loss recovery of $7.4 million in 2018 on a commercial mortgage loan paid off compared to charge-offs of $27.3 million taken on such loan in 2017.\nCommercial and Industrial loan net charge-offs for 2018 totaled $7.9 million, or 0.38% of average commercial and industrial loans, compared to $14.1 million, or 0.66%, for 2017. Commercial and Industrial loan net charge-offs for 2018 included $1.7 million associated with the transfer to held for sale of $1.8 million in nonaccrual loans. Commercial and Industrial loan net charge-offs for 2017 included the $10.7 million charge-off associated with the sale of the PREPA credit line.\nConstruction loans net charge-offs for 2018 were $8.0 million, or 6.75% of average construction loans, compared to net charge-offs of $2.9 million, or 2.05%, for 2017. The variance was primarily related to charge-offs totaling $6.7 million related to $33.0 million in nonaccrual construction loans transferred to held for sale during 2018.\nResidential mortgage loans net charge-offs for 2018 were $21.4 million, or 0.67% of average residential mortgage loans, compared to $25.7 million, or 0.79%, for 2017. Approximately $16.9 million in charge-offs for 2018 resulted from valuations for impairment purposes of residential mortgage loans considered homogeneous given high delinquency and loan-to-value levels compared to $17.7 million for 2017. Net charge-offs on residential mortgage loans also included $3.7 million related to foreclosures during 2018, compared to $6.6 million for 2017.\nNet charge-offs of consumer loans and finance leases for 2018 were $41.5 million, or 2.31% of average consumer loans and finance leases, compared to $36.5 million, or 2.12% of average loans, in 2017. The increase primarily reflects adjustments in the auto loan portfolio and hurricane-related charge-offs taken on credit cards during 2018. Approximately $10.9 million of the consumer loan charge-offs recorded in 2018 were taken against previously-established hurricane-related qualitative reserves associated with Hurricanes Irma and Maria.\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> The following table shows the ratios of net charge-offs to average loans by loan category for the last five years.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td>

Coupled with external influences, such as market conditions, security risks, and legal risks, the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased. To mitigate and control operational risk, the Corporation has developed, and continues to enhance, specific internal controls, policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization. The purpose of these mechanisms is to provide reasonable assurance that the Corporation's business operations are functioning within the policies and limits established by management.\nThe Corporation classifies operational risk into two major categories: business-specific and corporate-wide affecting all business lines. For business specific risks, a risk assessment group works with the various business units to ensure consistency in policies, processes and assessments. With respect to corporate-wide risks, such as information security, business recovery, and legal and compliance, the Corporation has specialized groups, such as the Legal Department, Information Security, Corporate Compliance, and Operations. These groups assist the lines of business in the development and implementation of risk management practices specific to the needs of the business groups.\nLegal and Compliance Risk\nLegal and compliance risk includes the risk of noncompliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the risk of adverse legal judgments against the Corporation, and the risk that a counterparty's performance obligations will be unenforceable. The Corporation is subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its business, and this regulatory scrutiny has been significantly increasing over the years. The Corporation has established, and continues to enhance procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements that are designed to ensure compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The Corporation has a Compliance Director who reports to the Chief Risk Officer and is responsible for the oversight of regulatory compliance and implementation of an enterprise-wide compliance risk assessment process. The Compliance division has officer roles in each major business area with direct reporting relationships to the Corporate Compliance Group.\nConcentration Risk\nThe Corporation conducts its operations in a geographically concentrated area, as its main market is Puerto Rico. However, the Corporation has diversified its geographical risk, as evidenced by its operations in the Virgin Islands and in Florida. Of the total gross loan portfolio held for investment of $8.9 billion as of December 31, 2018, approximately 74% has credit risk concentration in Puerto Rico, 21% in the United States, and 5% in the Virgin Islands.\nUpdate to the Puerto Rico Fiscal Situation\nEconomy indicators and projections\nA significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which has been in an economic recession since 2006 that has been exacerbated by the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. The New Fiscal Plan approved by the PROMESA oversight board, as revised on October 23, 2018 (the New Fiscal Plan\u201d), projects a contraction in Puerto Rico's gross national product of 8.0% for fiscal year 2018, followed by projected growths of 7.9% and 5.5% for fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively. Such projected growth was based on an assumption that over $82 billion of disaster relief funding will enter the economy of Puerto Rico from federal and private sources. Of the total disaster relief funding of $82 billion, estimated amounts of approximately $66 billion are to be used for public assistance, $3 billion for individual assistance, $8 billion for private and business insurance pay outs, and $5 billion is related to other federal funding. On July 30, 2018, HUD approved a $1.5 billion disaster recovery plan submitted by the Puerto Rico government that primarily focuses on the restoration of damaged and destroyed homes, businesses and infrastructure. The disaster recovery action plan includes the following activities: (i) housing ($1 billion) - for rebuilding and repairs of damaged properties, rental assistance, and appliances; (ii) economic revitalization ($145 million) - for eligible businesses to help-revitalize the post-disaster economy, including through grants; and (iii) infrastructure ($100 million) - for repairs of the damaged infrastructure in Puerto Rico. In February 2019, the Puerto Rico governor announced that HUD authorized the disbursement and use of funds approved through the aforementioned disaster recovery plan.\nThe Puerto Rico Economic Activity Index (the EDB-EAI\u201d) in November 2018 was 120.3, close to pre-hurricane levels of 122.1 in August 2017, and a 21.5% growth compared to post-hurricane levels of 99.0 in November 2017, mainly related to interruption of the electric energy system in 2017 due to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The EDB-EAI is a coincident index of economic activity for Puerto Rico made up of four indicators (non-farm payroll employment, electric power generation, cement sales and gasoline consumption). The cement sales for November 2018 totaled 1.2 million of 94-pound bags, an increase of 6.3% over the prior month, and an annual increase of 64.3%. Estimated gasoline consumption in November 2018 was 78.1 million gallons, a 2.8% decrease when compared with October 2018, and a decrease of 6.7% compared to the same period in 2017. Electric power generation for November 2018 totaled 1,532.5 million kilowatt-hours, an increase of 3.3% over the prior month, and an annual increase of 94.7% compared with the same period in 2017. The revised version of the New Fiscal Plan projects that the hurricanes will create a spike in inflation of 1.6% in fiscal year 2018, with subsequent average increases of about 1.49% over the next six years, until fiscal year 2023. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Puerto Rico was 8.3% in December 2018, compared to 11.0% in December 2017. The Puerto Rico labor force participation rate was 40.8% as of December 2018. The average of the labor force participation rate in Puerto Rico was 45.05% from 1990 until 2017, reaching an all-time high of 49.80% in February of 2007 and a record low of 38.6% in October of 2017. Based on information published by the Puerto Rico government, the labor force estimate was 1.1 million people as of December 2018, a reduction of 1.4% when compared with December 2017. The New Fiscal Plan reflects a 5.5% decline in population by fiscal year 2023.\nBased on information published by the Puerto Rico Treasury, the net revenues of the Puerto Rico government's General Fund in November 2018 totaled $556.9 million, which was $16.8 million less than in November 2017, and $25.5 million over projections of the New Fiscal Plan. The net revenue to the General Fund for the first five months of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 totaled $3,540.2 million, an increase of $611.8 million, compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year.\nGDB Liquidation Plan\nOn July 14, 2017, the PROMESA oversight board authorized the GDB to pursue the restructuring of its debts under Title VI of PROMESA and conditionally certified the GDB's Restructuring Support Agreement ( RSA\u201d) under the relevant provisions of Title VI. The PROMESA oversight board's decision was in response to a request from Puerto Rico's Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, dated June 30, 2017, in which the agency noted that the proposed restructuring, along with certain related settlements contemplated by the RSA, will result in an efficient wind down of the GDB's operations and a comprehensive financial restructuring of the GDB's obligations. The RSA provides for the organized and consensual restructuring of a substantial portion of the GDB's liabilities, including the GDB public bonds, deposit claims by municipalities and certain non-public entities, and claims under certain GDB-issued letters of credit and guarantees. In exchange for releasing the GDB from liability relating to these claims, the claim-holders will receive new bonds to be issued by a new entity.\nOn April 20, 2018, the PROMESA oversight board approved the new GDB fiscal plan. The new GDB fiscal plan authorizes the recently amended terms of RSA. It also paves the way for the GDB's operational wind-down, provides for a simplified transaction structure, and ensures equal treatment of creditors. It also offers municipalities offset rights against their deposit claims.\nNew Fiscal Plan\nThe New Fiscal Plan approved by the PROMESA oversight board, uses a six-year horizon and projects a 5.5% decline in population by fiscal year 2023. In addition, the revised New Fiscal Plan established an annual emergency reserve of $130 million for 10 years. As mentioned above, it also assumes $82 billion in disaster relief funding and projects that a $30 billion surplus will be generated through fiscal year 2033. The New Fiscal Plan includes a series of structural reforms in areas, such as: (i) human capital and labor; (ii) ease of doing business; (iii) power sector reform; and (iv) infrastructure reform. The New Fiscal Plan also proposes fiscal measures projected to drive $12.4 billion in increased revenues and reduced expenditures through fiscal year 2023 and projects that structural reforms will drive a cumulative 1.21% increase in growth by fiscal year 2058.\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico Budget\nOn May 10, 2018, the Puerto Rico governor proposed the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's budget for fiscal year 2018-2019. The proposed consolidated budget amounts to $25.3 billion and comes from the following sources:\n$8.7 billion from General Fund\n$8.1 billion from Federal Funds\n$7.5 billion from Revenue Funds\n$0.4 billion from Special State Funds\n$0.6 billion from Other Governmental Funds\nThe recommended General Fund budget amounted to $8.7 billion, a net decrease of $0.8 billion when compared with the budget approved for the fiscal year 2017-2018. On the other hand, the Federal Funds budgeted amount included in the proposed budget shows an increase of $1.8 billion or 28% more compared with the budget for fiscal year 2017-2018. However, the PROMESA oversight board concluded that the proposed Commonwealth of Puerto Rico budget for fiscal year 2018-2019 does not comply with the Fiscal Plan approved on April 19, 2018. On June 29, 2018, the PROMESA oversight board stated that, because of the Puerto Rico government's failure to enact labor reform, including the repeal of the law on unjustified work dismissals ( Law 80), it had certified a new revised version of the New Fiscal Plan that reflects, among other changes, a reduction of the projected 30-year surplus of the central government to $14.4 billion from the previous projection between $39 billion to $40 billion, the elimination of Christmas bonuses for public employees, and lower funding for infrastructure and municipalities.\nOn June 30, 2018, the PROMESA oversight board certified a revised budget for fiscal year 2019 that outlines expenditures of $8,757 million for the General Fund and $20,663 million for the consolidated budget.\nOn July 5, 2018, the Puerto Rico government filed a lawsuit seeking declaratory judgment that clarifies the PROMESA oversight board's power over the Commonwealth's budget.\nOn August 7, 2018, the U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled that the PROMESA oversight board has the power to enforce fiscal discipline through the budgetary process, but lacks authority to demand changes in laws.\nPuerto Rico Tax Reform of 2018 - Law Act\nOn December 10, 2018, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into Law Act 257, which amends numerous provisions of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 2011, including reducing the corporate and individual income tax rates, introducing a new earned income credit, limiting certain deductions, subjecting the gain on the sale of a Puerto Rico partnership interest to Puerto Rico income tax, changing certain sourcing rules, and amending the information reporting requirements. Act 257 also amended certain sales and use tax provisions. Please refer to Note 26 - Income Taxes, of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information, including the effect of the remeasurement of the Corporation's deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the maximum statutory tax rate in Puerto Rico from 39% to 37.5%. The PROMESA oversight board expressed concerns regarding certain provisions of Act 257. In particular, the PROMESA oversight board indicated that it has not received enough evidence from the Puerto Rico government to conclude that Act 257 will not negatively impact the Puerto Rico government's fiscal Plan. It has not yet been determined whether Act 257 will be further amended to accommodate any mandate from the PROMESA oversight board. The PROMESA oversight board issued a letter to the Governor of Puerto Rico on December 27, 2018 stating that Act 257 is not in compliance with PROMESA with respect to Articles 132 through 163, regarding the video lottery terminals (VLTs) that operate outside casinos in Puerto Rico. However, the letter provided that the PROMESA oversight board accepted Articles 1 through 131 and 164-165, which do not deal with VLTs operated outside casinos in Puerto Rico.\nThe Third Amended Title III Plan of Adjustment (the COFINA plan\u201d)\nOn February 4, 2019, the U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, approved the COFINA plan, a restructuring agreement for bondholders of debt issued by the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation ( COFINA,\u201d by its Spanish acronym). The COFINA plan restructures $18.0 billion of COFINA debt, which represents 24% of Puerto Rico's funded debt. In addition, the COFINA plan reduced the annual cash flow to COFINA from a maximum of $1.8 billion to $992 million and provides to the Government of Puerto Rico an average annual savings of $425 million for the next 40 years.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 15, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that members of the PROMESA oversight board created by PROMESA are Officers of the Unites States\u201d subject to the U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause and directed the district court to enter a declaratory judgement to the effect that PROMESA's protocol for the appointment of Board Members is unconstitutional.\nThis matter arose from the restructuring of Puerto Rico's public debt under PROMESA. In May 2017, the PROMESA oversight board exercised its authority under Title III of PROMESA to initiate debt adjustment proceedings on behalf of the Puerto Rico government. Appellants sought to dismiss the Title III proceedings, arguing that the PROMESA oversight board lacked authority to initiate them because the PROMESA oversight board members were illegally appointed in contravention of the Appointments Clause. The district court rejected Appellants' motions to dismiss. The First Circuit reversed in part, (1) the Territorial Clause does not displace the Appointments Clause in an unincorporated territory such as Puerto Rico; (2) Board Members are Principal\u201d Officers of the United States\u201d subject to the Appointments Clause; and (3) therefore, the process PROMESA provides for the appointment of Board Members is unconstitutional. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit set a 90-day period to allow President Donald Trump and the U.S. Senate to constitutionally validate the appointments or reconstitute the PROMESA oversight board.\nOn February 22, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' complaint against the PROMESA oversight board and its members and executive director alleging that the PROMESA oversight board had exceeded its power under PROMESA during the 2019 fiscal plan and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's budget development and certification processes, holding that the complaint was properly dismissed.\nExposure to the Puerto Rico Government\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $214.6 million of direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its municipalities and public corporations, compared to $214.5 million as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $191.9 million of the exposure consisted of loans and obligations of municipalities in Puerto Rico that are supported by assigned property tax revenues and for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality have been pledged to their repayment, compared to $184.6 million as of December 31, 2017. Approximately 75% of the Corporation's municipality exposure consisted primarily of senior priority obligations concentrated in three of the largest municipalities in Puerto Rico. These municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as are required for the payment of all of their respective general obligation bonds and notes. The PROMESA oversight board has not designated any of the Commonwealth's 78 municipalities as covered entities under PROMESA. However, while the revised fiscal plan certified by the PROMESA oversight board did not contemplate a restructuring of the debt of Puerto Rico's municipalities, the plan did call for the gradual elimination of budgetary subsidies provided to municipalities. Furthermore, municipalities are also likely to be affected by the negative economic and other effects resulting from expense, revenue or cash management measures taken to address the Puerto Rico government's fiscal and liquidity shortfalls, as well as measures included in fiscal plans of other government entities. In addition to municipalities, the total direct exposure also included a $14.5 million loan to an affiliate of PREPA and obligations of the Puerto Rico government, specifically bonds of the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority, at an amortized cost of $8.2 million as part of its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio (fair value of $7.0 million as of December 31, 2018).\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> The following table details the Corporation's total direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government according to their maturities:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Amortized cost)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Exposure\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAfter 5 to 10 years\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAfter 10 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,185\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,185\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Public Corporations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Affiliate of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAfter 1 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,489\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Public Corporations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,489\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Municipalities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAfter 1 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,256\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAfter 5 to 10 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAfter 10 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,699\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Municipalities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 144,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191,971\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Direct Government Exposure\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 153,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 214,645\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $112.1 million in exposure to residential mortgage loans that are guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority. Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. The Puerto Rico government guarantees up to $75 million of the principal under the mortgage loan insurance program. According to the most recently-released audited financial statements of the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority, as of June 30, 2016, the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority's mortgage loans insurance program covered loans in an aggregate of approximately $576 million. The regulations adopted by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority require the establishment of adequate reserves to guarantee the solvency of the mortgage loan insurance fund. As of June 30, 2016, the most recent date as to which information is available, the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority had a restricted net position for such purposes of approximately $77.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $677.3 million of public sector deposits in Puerto Rico, compared to $490.3 million as of December 31, 2017. Approximately 34% is from municipalities and municipal agencies in Puerto Rico and 66% is from public corporations and the central government and agencies in Puerto Rico.\nExposure to USVI government\nThe Corporation has operations in the USVI and has credit exposure to USVI government entities.\nThe USVI is experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges, exacerbated by the impact of Hurricane Irma in the third quarter of 2017, that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI and, as such, there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the USVI and its public corporations and instrumentalities.\nTo the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI government continues to deteriorate, the U.S. Congress or the government of the USVI may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of the USVI government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable to the USVI.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $55.8 million in loans to USVI government instrumentalities and public corporations, compared to $70.4 million as of December 31, 2017. Of the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2018, public corporations of the USVI owed approximately $32.6 million and an independent instrumentality of the USVI government owed approximately $23.2 million. As of December 31, 2018, all loans were currently performing and up to date on principal and interest payments.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the measurement of the financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nUnlike most industrial companies, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rate movements are not necessarily correlated with changes in the prices of goods and services.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe Corporation has included in this Form 10-K the following financial measures that are not recognized under GAAP, which are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures:\n1. Net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin are reported excluding the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and on a tax-equivalent basis in order to provide to investors additional information about the Corporation's net interest income that management uses and believes should facilitate comparability and analysis. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments have no effect on interest due or interest earned on interest-bearing liabilities or interest-earning assets, respectively. The tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets and assumes a marginal income tax rate. Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt securities and tax-exempt loans, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to the results of peers. See Results of Operations - Net Interest Income\u201d above for the table that reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure net interest income excluding fair value changes and on a tax-equivalent basis\u201d with net interest income calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The table also reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures net interest spread and margin excluding fair value changes and on a tax-equivalent basis\u201d with net interest spread and margin calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n2. The tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures generally used by the financial community to evaluate capital adequacy. Tangible common equity is total equity less preferred equity, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, and other intangibles, such as the purchased credit card relationship intangible and the insurance customer relationship intangible. Tangible assets are total assets less goodwill, core deposit intangibles, and other intangibles, such as the purchased credit card relationship intangible and the insurance customer relationship intangible. Management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase method of accounting for mergers and acquisitions. Accordingly, the Corporation believes that disclosure of these financial measures is useful to investors. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets, or the related measures, should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders' equity, total assets, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which the Corporation calculates tangible common equity, tangible assets, and any other related\nmeasures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. See Risk Management - Capital\u201d above for a reconciliation of the Corporation's tangible common equity and tangible assets.\n3. Adjusted provision for loan and lease losses and the ratio of adjusted provision for loan and lease losses to net charge-offs are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects related to the net loan loss reserve release of $16.9 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2018 and a $71.3 million charge to the provision for loan and lease losses in the year ended December 31, 2017 in connection with estimates of the qualitative reserves associated with the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of First BanCorp. and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and the notes thereto. This section also presents certain financial measures that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). See Basis of Presentation\u201d below for information about why the non-GAAP financial measures are being presented and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures for which the reconciliation is not presented earlier.\nDescription of Business\nFirst BanCorp. is a diversified financial holding company headquartered in San Juan, Puerto Rico offering a full range of financial products to consumers and commercial customers through various subsidiaries. First BanCorp. is the holding company (the Holding Company\u201d) of FirstBank Puerto Rico and FirstBank Insurance Agency. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Corporation operates offices in Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands, and the State of Florida (USA), concentrating on commercial banking, residential mortgage loan originations, finance leases, credit cards, personal loans, small loans, auto loans, and insurance agency activities. On August 1, 2018, the Bank's Board of Directors approved a resolution to dissolve the broker-dealer subsidiary FirstBank Securities. Accordingly, FirstBank Securities filed the required Form BDW for the withdrawal of its registration from the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and its license to operate as broker-dealer was terminated effective September 30, 2018. Management is in the process of completing the dissolution of FirstBank Securities as a legal entity under the state laws.\nEXECUTIVE Overview of Results of Operations\nFirst BanCorp.'s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest-earning assets, including investment securities and loans, and the interest expense incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by various factors, including: the interest rate scenario; the volumes, mix and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; and the re-pricing characteristics of these assets and liabilities. The Corporation's results of operations also depend on the provision for loan and lease losses, non-interest expenses (such as personnel, occupancy, the deposit insurance premium and other costs), non-interest income (mainly service charges and fees on deposits, and insurance income), gains (losses) on sales of investments, gains (losses) on mortgage banking activities, and income taxes.\nThe Corporation had net income of $201.6 million, or $0.92 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a $67.0 million, or $0.30 per diluted common share, for 2017, and $93.2 million, or $0.43 per diluted common share, for 2016.\nThe key drivers of the Corporation's GAAP financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, include the following:\n\u00b7 Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $525.4 million compared to $491.6 million and $484.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by: (i) a $17.2 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans, primarily associated with the upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans; (ii) a $9.1 million increase in interest income on investment securities, primarily due to the gradual reinvestment of liquidity and proceeds from maturing debt securities into higher-yielding U.S. agencies debt securities and MBS; (iii) a $7.5 million increase in interest income on consumer loans, mainly due to a $77.8 million increase in the average balance of this portfolio, primarily auto loans and finance leases; and (iv) a $6.5 million increase in interest income from interest-bearing cash balances, primarily deposits maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, due to both a higher average balance and increases in the Federal Funds target rate.\nThese variances were partially offset by: (i) a $3.7 million decrease in interest income on residential mortgage loans, primarily associated with an $81.2 million decrease in the average balance of this portfolio; and (ii) a $2.7 million increase in total interest expense, driven an increase in the use of long-term FHLB advances during 2018 and higher market interest rates on the cost of retail CDs and commercial money market accounts tied to variable short-term interest rates, partially offset by a $480.3 million decrease in the average balance of brokered CDs.\nThe net interest margin increased to 4.55% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 4.36% for 2017, primarily due to the aforementioned upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans, the gradual reinvestment of liquidity in higher-yielding securities, and an improved funding mix, driven by the increase in the proportion of interest-earning assets funded by the growth in non-interest bearing deposits.\nThe increase for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by: (i) a $12.5 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans, primarily associated with both the upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans and the growth of the performing commercial portfolios, primarily in the Florida region; (ii) a $4.3 million decrease in interest expense, including a decrease of $2.8 million in interest expense on brokered CDs, primarily related to a $509.0 million decrease in the average balance of brokered CDs that offset higher costs on new issuances, and a $9.3 million decrease in interest expense on repurchase agreements, primarily reflecting the full-year effect of the repayment of $400 million of repurchase agreements that matured in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and carried an average cost of 3.35%, partially offset by increases of $5.2 million and $2.0 million in interest expense on FHLB advances and non-brokered deposits, respectively; and (iii) a $1.2 million increase in interest income from deposits maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, due to increases in the Federal Funds target rate in 2017 and late in 2016.\nThe aforementioned variances were partially offset by: (i) a $5.6 million decrease in interest income on consumer loans and finance leases, primarily reflecting a $33.5 million decrease in the average balance of this portfolio, primarily auto loans, and, to a lesser extent, the effect of a $1.4 million decrease in late payment fees as the Corporation did not assess late charges during the fourth quarter of 2017 to customers affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria that qualified for the three-month payment deferral program established by the Corporation after the hurricanes; and (ii) a $5.3 million decrease in interest income on residential mortgage loans, reflecting both a higher level of inflows of residential mortgage loans to non-performing status and a $41.8 million decrease in the average balance of this portfolio.\n\u00b7 The provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $59.3 million compared to $144.3 million and $86.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2018, the Corporation recorded a net loan loss reserve release of $16.9 million in connection with revised estimates of the hurricane-related qualitative reserves associated with the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, compared to hurricane-related charges to the provision of $71.3 million recorded in 2017. See Results of Operations - Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d below for details about the Corporation's approach to the estimation of hurricane-related qualitative reserves. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the aforementioned effects of the hurricane-related qualitative reserves, the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses for 2018 was $76.2 million compared to $73.0 million and $86.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by a $26.2 million increase in the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses for commercial and construction loans, driven by charges of $22.3 million related to developments in problem loans resolution strategies, including a $15.7 million charge on loans transferred to held for sale during 2018, partially offset by a $22.6 million decrease in the adjusted provision for residential mortgage loans, primarily reflecting a decline in charge-offs, nonaccrual and delinquent loan levels, and the overall decrease in the size of this portfolio.\nThe decrease in the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by: (i) a $22.1 million decrease in the adjusted provision for commercial and construction loans reflecting, among other things, lower specific reserve requirements for impaired loans and a $2.9 million increase in loan loss recoveries; and (ii) a $2.8 million decrease in the adjusted provision for consumer loans and finance leases, mainly related to lower levels of personal and small loans delinquencies. These variances were partially offset by an $11.1 million increase in the adjusted provision for residential mortgage loans, primarily related to a higher level of residential nonaccrual loans, increased specific reserves for residential mortgage TDRs, and higher loss severity estimates in 2017.\nSee Basis of Presentation\u201d below for additional information and reconciliation of the provision for loan and lease losses in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP adjusted provision for loan and lease losses.\nNet charge-offs totaled $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 1.09% of average loans, a decrease of $23.3 million, compared to net charge-offs of $118.0 million, or 1.33% of average loans, for 2017 and $121.8 million, or 1.37% of average loans, for 2016. The decrease in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily reflects a $24.0 million decrease in net charge-offs taken on commercial and construction loans and a $4.4 million decrease in net charge-offs of residential mortgage loans, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in net charge-offs taken on consumer loans. During 2018, the Corporation recorded a loan loss recovery of $7.4 million on a commercial mortgage TDR loan paid off during the year compared to charge-offs of $27.3 million taken on such loan in 2017. This variance was partially offset by the effect in 2018 of charge-offs totaling $12.5 million taken on nonaccrual commercial and construction loans transferred to held for sale. See Results of Operations - Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d and Risk Management - Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Non-Performing Assets\u201d below for an analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses and non-performing assets and related ratios.\n\u00b7 The Corporation recorded non-interest income of $82.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $62.4 million and $88.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by: (i) the effect in 2017 of a $12.2 million other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) charge on three Puerto Rico Government debt securities, specifically bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority; (ii) a $3.7 million increase in revenues from mortgage banking activities, driven by adjustments recorded in 2018 that reduced the valuation allowance of mortgage servicing rights and higher servicing fees; (iii) a $3.6 million increase in fee-based income from ATMs, POS, credit and debit cards, and merchant-related activities; and (iv) a $1.2 million increase in gains from sales of fixed assets, primarily assets of relocated or closed banking branches in Florida and Puerto Rico. These variances were partially offset by a $2.8 million net loss recorded on sales of nonaccrual commercial and construction loans held for sale completed in 2018.\nThe decrease for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by: (i) a $6.9 million decrease in revenues from mortgage banking activities, primarily due to lower conforming loan origination and sales volume associated with both the drop in business activity in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands after the hurricanes and higher market interest rates; (ii) the effect in 2016 of a $6.1 million gain on sales of $198.7 million of U.S. agency MBS; (iii) a $5.9 million increase in OTTI charges on bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority; (iv) a $2.9 million decrease in gains associated with repurchases and cancellations of trust-preferred securities; (v) the effect in 2016 of a $1.5 million gain from the recovery of a residual collateralized mortgage obligation ( CMO\u201d) previously written off; and (vi) the effect in 2016 of brokerage and insurance commissions of $1.8 million, primarily related to the sale of large fixed annuities contracts.\n\u00b7 Non-interest expenses for 2018 were $357.8 million compared to $347.7 million and $355.1 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by: (i) a $7.6 million increase in employees' compensation and benefit expenses reflecting, among other things, salary merit increases and adjustments related to the Corporation's annual salary review process, higher headcount, and an increase in the Bank's matching contribution to the employees' retirement plans; (ii) a $3.5 million increase in losses from OREO operations reflecting, among other things, a $2.1 million increase in adverse fair value adjustments to the value of OREO properties and a $1.3 million increase in OREO operating expenses, including taxes, insurance and maintenance fees; (iii) a $2.3 million increase in business promotion expenses, primarily due to increased advertising, marketing, promotions and sponsorship-related activities during 2018; and (iv) a $1.3 million increase in occupancy and equipment costs, primarily due to hurricane-related expenses incurred in 2018 associated with repairs and security matters. These variances were partially offset by a $4.8 million decrease in the FDIC insurance premium expense due to, among other things, improved earnings trends, reduction in brokered CDs, and higher liquidity levels tied to the growth in non-interest bearing deposits.\nThe decrease for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to: (i) a $6.3 million decrease in the FDIC insurance premium expense, mainly related to the effect of reductions in brokered deposits and average assets, a strengthened capital position, and improved liquidity metrics; (ii) a $2.1 million decrease in the provision for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit; (iii) a $0.8 million decrease in write-downs, loss on sales and expenses related to non-real estate repossessed assets; (iv) a $0.6 million decrease in communications-related matters such as telephone and postage expenses; (v) a $0.6 million decrease in taxes, other than income taxes, primarily related to decreases in the sales and use tax expense and in municipal license taxes in Puerto Rico; (vi) a $0.5 million decrease in losses from OREO operations, primarily reflecting a $1.8 million decrease in write-downs to the value of OREO properties, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in rental income from commercial OREO income-producing properties; and (vii) a $0.4 million decrease in credit and debit card processing expenses, primarily associated with a lower volume of transactions affected by the drop in business activity after the hurricanes in 2017. These variances were partially offset by: (i) a $1.8 million increase in professional service fees, primarily reflecting higher consulting fees related to the implementation of new technology systems and higher outsourcing fees related to network services; (ii) a $1.5 million increase in occupancy and equipment costs, primarily due to higher electricity expenses, property taxes and rental expenses; (iii) a $1.1 million increase in business promotion expenses, reflecting the effect in 2016 of a $2.7 million adjustment recorded to reduce the credit card rewards program liability due to the expiration of reward points earned by customers up to September 2013 (the conversion date of the credit card portfolio acquired from FIA in May 2012) and costs of approximately $1.0 million related to hurricane relief efforts and assistance to employees incurred in 2017, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease associated with lower advertising and marketing-related activities.\n\u00b7 For 2018, the Corporation recorded an income tax benefit of $11.0 million compared to income tax benefit of $5.0 million for 2017 and income tax expense of $37.0 million for 2016. The income tax benefit recorded in 2018 reflects, among other things, the effect of a $63.2 million benefit related to a partial reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, partially offset by a one-time charge of $9.9 million associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets resulting from the enactment of Act 257 (net of the $5.6 million related impact in the valuation allowance). The income tax benefit recorded in 2017 reflects the effect of the tax benefit related to hurricane-related charges to the provision for loan and lease losses and a $13.2 million tax benefit recorded as a result of the change in tax status of certain subsidiaries from taxable corporations to limited liability companies that have elected to be treated as partnerships for income tax purposes in Puerto Rico. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had a net deferred tax asset of $319.9 million (net of a valuation allowance of $100.7 million, including a valuation allowance of $68.1 million against the deferred tax assets of the Corporation's banking subsidiary, FirstBank). See Results of Operations - Income Taxes\u201d below for additional information.\n\u00b7 As of December 31, 2018, total assets were approximately $12.2 billion, a decrease of $17.7 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease primarily reflects a $130.2 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, largely driven by liquidity used for the repayment of $657.9 million of maturing brokered CDs, the repayment of $200 million of repurchase agreements, the repurchase of $23.8 million of trust-preferred securities, and liquidity reinvested in higher-yielding U.S. agencies debt and MBS, partially offset by liquidity obtained from the growth in non-interest bearing deposits. In addition, the OREO portfolio balance decreased by $16.5 million.\nThe aforementioned decreases were partially offset by a $51.6 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities, driven by purchases of U.S agencies MBS and debt securities, a $25.0 million increase in the net deferred tax asset, and a $17.9 million increase in total loans. The decrease in total loans reflects a growth of $168.6 million in the Florida region, partially offset by decreases of $103.4 million and $47.4 million in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, respectively. Total loans for 2018 reflect an increase in the consumer loan portfolio of $194.8 million, partially offset by reductions of $125.4 million and $51.6 million in the residential mortgage and commercial and construction loan portfolios, respectively. The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $35.5 million during 2018 reflecting, among other things, the effect of releases associated with revised estimates of the hurricane-related qualitative reserve. See Financial Condition and Operating Data Analysis - Assets\u201d below for additional information.\n\u00b7 As of December 31, 2018, total liabilities were $10.2 billion, a decrease of $193.3 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly related to: (i) a $594.9 million decrease in brokered CDs; (ii) a $149.9 million decrease in repurchase agreements; and (iii) the repurchase of $23.8 million of trust-preferred securities. These reductions were partially offset by a $318.2 million increase in deposits, excluding brokered CDs and government deposits, a $248.8 million increase in government deposits, and a $25.0 million increase in FHLB advances. A significant portion of the increase in non-brokered deposits was in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which grew 31%, or $561.8 million which, in part, reflects the effect of hurricane-related factors such as settlements of insurance claims and disaster relief funds. See Risk Management - Liquidity and Capital Adequacy\u201d below for additional information about the Corporation's funding sources.\n\u00b7 As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation's stockholders' equity was $2.0 billion, an increase of $175.6 million from December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly driven by the earnings generated in 2018, partially offset by the decrease in the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities recorded as part of other comprehensive loss in total equity and dividends paid on preferred and common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2018, for the first time since June 2009, the Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per common share, or an aggregate of $6.5 million. In addition, the Corporation continued to pay monthly dividends on its non-cumulative perpetual monthly income preferred stock totaling $2.7 million in 2018. The Corporation's Total Capital, Common equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Leverage ratios calculated under the Basel III rules were 24.00%, 20.30%, 20.71%, and 15.37%, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, compared to Total Capital, Common equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Leverage ratios of 22.53%, 18.96%, 18.97%, and 14.03%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. The Corporation's tangible common equity ratio increased to 16.14% as of December 31, 2018, from 14.65% as of December 31, 2017. See Risk Management - Capital\u201d below for additional information.\n\u00b7 Total loan production, including purchases, refinancings, renewals and draws from existing revolving and non-revolving commitments, was $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, excluding the utilization activity on outstanding credit cards. Total loan originations in the Puerto Rico region of $2.4 billion increased by $304.4 million, compared to 2017. The growth in the Puerto Rico region consisted of increases of $237.6 million, $45.5 million, and $21.3 million in consumer, residential, and commercial loans, respectively. In addition, total loan originations in the Virgin Islands increased by $26.9 million. Total loan originations in the Florida region decreased by $92.4 million, primarily reflected in lower residential mortgage loan originations.\n\u00b7 Total non-performing assets were $467.1 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $183.5 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to: (i) the restoration to accrual status of two large commercial loans totaling $69.7 million; (ii) sales of $61.9 million of nonaccrual commercial and construction loans held for sale; (iii) collections on commercial and construction nonaccrual loans of $32.3 million; (iv) commercial and construction nonaccrual loan charge-offs totaling $40.3 million; (v) a $31.0 million decrease in residential nonaccrual loans, and (vi) a $16.5 million decrease in the OREO portfolio balance. These variances were partially offset by the inflow of two large commercial mortgage loans totaling $69.8 million related to a legacy commercial loan relationship that operates in both the Florida and Puerto Rico regions with independent sources of repayment. See Risk Management - Non-accruing and Non-performing Assets\u201d below for additional information.\n\u00b7 Adversely classified commercial and construction loans, including loans held for sale, decreased by $126.4 million to $356.0 million as of December 31, 2018, driven primarily by the sale of five large commercial and construction loans totaling $66.1 million, the upgrade in the credit risk classification of several commercial loans totaling $125.7 million, and collections and charge-offs recorded during 2018. These variances were partially offset by the downgrade in the credit risk classification of three large commercial loans totaling $110.4 million, including the aforementioned $69.8 million in two large commercial loans classified as nonaccrual during 2018.\nThe Corporation's financial results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 included the following significant items that management believes are not reflective of core operating performance, are not expected to reoccur with any regularity or may reoccur at uncertain times and in uncertain amounts (the Special Items\u201d):\nYear ended December 31, 2018\n\u00b7 Tax benefit of $63.2 million resulting from the partial reversal of the Corporation's deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\n\u00b7 One-time charge to the income tax expense of $9.9 million related to the enactment of the Puerto Rico Tax Reform of 2018, specifically in connection with the reduction of the Corporation's deferred tax assets as a result of the decrease in the maximum corporate tax rate in Puerto Rico from 39% to 37.5%.\n\u00b7 Net loan loss reserve releases of $16.9 million ($10.3 million after-tax) in connection with revised estimates of the qualitative reserves associated with the effects of Hurricanes Maria and Irma.

The Corporation's critical accounting policies relate to: 1) the allowance for loan and lease losses; 2) OTTI; 3) income taxes; 4) the classification and values of financial instruments; 5) income recognition on loans; 6) loans acquired; and 7) loans held for sale. These critical accounting policies involve judgments, estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the amounts recorded for assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from estimates, if different assumptions or conditions prevail. Certain determinations inherently require greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than those originally reported.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe Corporation maintains the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level considered adequate to absorb incurred losses currently inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The Corporation does not maintain an allowance for held-for-sale loans or PCI loans that are performing in accordance with or better than expectations as of the date of acquisition, as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component. The allowance for loan and lease losses provides for probable incurred losses that have been identified with specific valuation allowances for individually evaluated impaired loans and for probable incurred losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio that have not been specifically identified. The determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses requires significant estimates, including with respect to the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, consideration of current economic conditions and business strategies, and historical loss experience pertaining to the portfolios and pools of homogeneous loans, all of which may be susceptible to change.\nThe Corporation evaluates the need for changes to the allowance by portfolio loan segments and classes of loans within certain of those portfolio segments. The Corporation combines loans with similar credit risk characteristics into the following portfolio segments: commercial mortgage, construction, commercial and industrial, residential mortgage, and consumer loans. Classes are usually disaggregations of the portfolio segments. The classes within the residential mortgage segment are residential mortgages guaranteed by the U.S. government and other residential loans. The classes within the consumer portfolio are auto, finance lease, and other consumer loans. Other consumer loans mainly include unsecured personal loans, credit cards, home equity lines, lines of credits, and marine financing. The classes within the construction loan portfolio are land loans, construction of commercial projects, and construction of residential projects. The commercial mortgage and commercial and industrial segments are not further segmented into classes. The adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is based on judgments related to the credit quality of each portfolio segment. These judgments consider ongoing evaluations of each portfolio segment, including such factors as the economic risks associated with each loan class, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the geography (Puerto Rico, Florida or the Virgin Islands), the level of delinquent loans, historical loss experience, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. In addition to the general economic conditions and other factors described above, additional factors considered include the internal risk ratings assigned to loans. An internal risk rating is assigned to each commercial and construction loan at the time of approval and is subject to subsequent periodic review by the Corporation's senior management. The allowance for loan and lease losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis as part of the Corporation's continued evaluation of its asset quality.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through a provision for credit losses that is charged to earnings, based on the quarterly evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, and is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses consists of specific reserves based upon valuations of loans considered to be impaired and general reserves. A specific valuation allowance is established for individual impaired loans in the commercial mortgage, construction, and commercial and industrial portfolios and certain boat loans, residential mortgage loans, and home equity lines of credit, primarily when the collateral value of the loan (if the impaired loan is determined to be collateral dependent) or the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective rate is lower than the carrying amount of that loan. The loans within the commercial mortgage, construction, and commercial and industrial portfolios, and boat loans of $1 million or more are individually evaluated for impairment. Also, certain residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit are individually evaluated for impairment purposes based on their delinquency and loan to value levels. When foreclosure of a collateral dependent loan is probable, the impairment measure is based on the fair value of the collateral. The fair value of the collateral is generally obtained from appraisals. Updated appraisals are obtained when the Corporation determines that loans are impaired and are generally updated annually thereafter according to the Corporation's appraisal policy. In addition, appraisals and/or appraiser price opinions are also obtained for residential mortgage loans based on specific characteristics such as delinquency levels, age of the appraisal, and loan-to-value ratios. The excess of the recorded investment in a collateral dependent loan over the resulting fair value of the collateral is charged-off when deemed uncollectible.\nFor all other loans, which include small, homogeneous loans, such as auto loans, and the other classes in the consumer loan portfolio, residential mortgages and commercial and construction loans not individually evaluated for impairment, the Corporation\nmaintains a general valuation allowance established through a process that begins with estimates of incurred losses based upon various statistical analyses. The general reserve is primarily determined by applying loss factors according to the loan type and assigned risk category (pass, special mention, and substandard loans that are not considered to be impaired; all doubtful loans are considered impaired).\nThe Corporation uses a roll-rate methodology to estimate losses on its consumer loan portfolio based on delinquencies and considering credit bureau score bands. The Corporation tracks the historical portfolio performance to arrive at a weighted-average distribution in each subgroup of each delinquency bucket. Roll-to-loss rates (loss factors) are calculated by multiplying the roll rates from each subgroup within the delinquency buckets forward through loss. Once roll rates are calculated, the resulting loss factor is applied to the existing receivables in the applicable subgroups within the delinquency buckets and the end results are aggregated to arrive at the required allowance level. The Corporation's assessment also involves evaluating key qualitative and environmental factors, which include credit and macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment, bankruptcy trends, recent market transactions, and collateral values to account for current market conditions that are likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical loss experience. The Corporation analyzes the expected delinquency migration to determine the future volume of delinquencies.\nThe cash flow analysis for each residential mortgage pool is performed at the individual loan level and then aggregated to the pool level in determining the overall loss ratio (the base methodology\u201d). The model applies risk-adjusted prepayment curves, default curves, and severity curves to each loan in the pool. For loan restructuring pools, the present value of future cash flows under the new terms, at the loan's effective interest rate, is taken into consideration. Additionally, estimates of default risk and prepayments related to loan restructurings are based on, among other things, the historical experience of these loans. Loss severity is affected by the house price scenario, which is based in part on recent house price trends. Default curves are used in the model. The attributes that are most significant to the probability of default include present collection status (current, delinquent, in bankruptcy, in foreclosure stage), vintage, loan-to-values, and geography (Puerto Rico, Florida or the Virgin Islands). The estimates of the risk-adjusted timing of liquidations and associated costs are used in the model, and are risk-adjusted for the geographic area in which each property is located.\nFor commercial loans, historical charge-off rates are calculated by the Corporation on a quarterly basis for each commercial loan regulatory-based credit risk category (i.e. pass, special mention, substandard, and doubtful) using the historical charge-offs and portfolio balances over their average loss emergence period (the raw loss rate\u201d) for each credit risk classification. However, when not enough loss experience is observed in a particular risk-rated category and the calculation results in a loss rate for such risk-rated category that is lower than the loss rate of a less severe risk-rated category, the Corporation uses the loss rate of such less severe category. A qualitative factor adjustment is applied to the base rate average utilizing a resulting factor derived from a set of risk-based ratings and weights assigned to credit and economic indicators over a reasonable period applied to a developed expected range of historical losses and a basis point adjustment derived from the difference between the average raw loss rate and the highest loss rate observed during a look-back period that management determined was appropriate to use for each region to identify any relevant effect during an economic cycle.\nHurricane-related Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nDuring 2017, management established a separate qualitative element of the allowance to estimate inherent losses associated with the effect of Hurricanes Maria and Irma on the Corporation's loan portfolios in Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands. This qualitative element of the allowance was initially determined based on the estimated effect that the hurricanes could have on employment levels (e.g., an unemployment rate that significantly increases from levels in Puerto Rico at the time of the hurricanes based on statistics observed in the aftermath of similar natural disasters in the U.S. mainland like Hurricane Katrina), economic activity in the Corporation's geographic regions, and the time it could take for the affected regions to return to a more normalized operating environment.\nFor large commercial and construction loan relationships, loan officers performed individual reviews of the effect of the hurricanes on these borrowers' sources of repayment. These large relationships, that represented 80% of the outstanding balance of the Corporation's commercial and construction loan portfolio at the time of the hurricanes, were analyzed and divided into three hurricane-affected categories (i.e. Low, Medium and High). Clients categorized as Low had no effect, or relatively insignificant effect, as a result of the storms. Clients in the Medium category had demonstrated that they had sufficient liquidity to satisfy their obligations, but the complexity of the insurance claim process may affect their primary or secondary source of repayment. Finally, clients categorized as High could potentially have problems with their primary or secondary sources of repayment as they have a higher degree of uncertainty with respect to the timing of the insurance claim resolution, and the full reestablishment of their businesses is highly dependent on the timely receipt of insurance proceeds. Reserve levels were then recognized for these particular loans based on this stratification. For loans in the Low category, no additional qualitative hurricane-related reserve was calculated. For loans in the Medium and High categories, the Corporation stressed the general reserve loss factors applicable to these loans to reflect higher default probabilities not reflected in the historical data.\nThis review also resulted in downgrades in the credit risk classification of certain loans and their reserves were determined following the methodology applicable to criticized and adversely classified loans, as appropriate.\nDuring 2018, the Corporation performed additional procedures to evaluate the adequacy of the qualitative reserve, including the consideration of updated payment patterns and probability of default credit risk analyses applied to consumer loan borrowers subject to payment deferral programs that expired early in 2018. For the determination of the hurricane-related qualitative reserve for residential mortgage loans as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation stressed the loss factors derived from its above-described base methodology by incorporating assumptions of further deterioration in the housing price index and higher loan modification levels. Although the foreclosure moratoriums extended by the FHA to hurricane-affected individuals ended on September 15, 2018, there are likely to be additional delays in foreclosure actions due to court-related backlogs. For the determination of the hurricane-related qualitative reserve for commercial and construction loans not individually reviewed as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation segregated the portfolio based on delinquency levels and stressed the general reserve loss factors applicable to 30-89 days past due loans to reflect higher default probabilities.\nAs a result of the aforementioned analyses, the Corporation recorded a net loan loss reserve release of $16.9 million in 2018 and a charge to the provision of $71.3 million in 2017 associated with the hurricanes. As of December 31, 2018, the hurricane-related qualitative allowance was $19.2 million (2017 - $55.6 million). See Results of Operations - Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d below for additional information, including details about the hurricane-related qualitative allowance segregated by loans portfolio segments.\nCharge-off of Uncollectible Loans - Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balances of loans held for investment that the Corporation determines are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Collateral dependent loans in the construction, commercial mortgage, and commercial and industrial loan portfolios are charged off to their net realizable value (fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell) when loans are considered to be uncollectible. Within the consumer loan portfolio, auto loans and finance leases are reserved once they are 120 days delinquent and are charged off to their estimated net realizable value when the collateral deficiency is deemed uncollectible (i.e., when foreclosure/repossession is probable) or when the loan is 365 days past due. Within the other consumer loan portfolio, closed-end loans are charged off when payments are 120 days in arrears, except small personal loans. Open-end (revolving credit) consumer loans, including credit card loans, and small personal loans are charged off when payments are 180 days in arrears. On a quarterly basis, residential mortgage loans that are 180 days delinquent and have an original loan-to-value ratio that is higher than 60% are reviewed and charged-off, as needed, to the fair value of the underlying collateral. Generally, all loans may be charged off or written down to the fair value of the collateral prior to the application of the policies described above if a loss-confirming event has occurred. Loss-confirming events include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy (unsecured), continued delinquency, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency when the asset is the sole source of repayment. The Corporation does not record charge-offs on PCI loans that are performing in accordance with or better than expectations as of the date of acquisition, as the fair value of these loans already reflects a credit component. The Corporation records charge-offs on PCI loans only if actual losses exceed estimated losses incorporated into the fair value recorded at acquisition and the amount is deemed uncollectible.\nOther-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI\u201d)\nOn a quarterly basis, the Corporation performs an assessment to determine whether there have been any events or economic circumstances indicating that a security with an unrealized loss has suffered an OTTI. A security is considered impaired if the fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. The Corporation employs a systematic methodology that considers all available evidence in evaluating a potential impairment of its investments.\nThe impairment analysis of debt securities places special emphasis on the analysis of the cash position of the issuer and its cash and capital generation capacity, which could increase or diminish the issuer's ability to repay its bond obligations, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, any adverse change to the credit conditions and liquidity of the issuer, taking into consideration the latest information available about the financial condition of the issuer, credit ratings, the failure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments, recent legislation and government actions affecting the issuer's industry, and actions taken by the issuer to deal with the economic climate. The Corporation also takes into consideration changes in the near-term prospects of the underlying collateral of a security, if any, such as changes in default rates, loss severity given default, and significant changes in prepayment assumptions and the level of cash flows generated from the underlying collateral, if any, supporting the principal and interest payments of the debt securities. OTTI must be recognized in earnings if the Corporation has the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. However, even if the Corporation does not expect to sell a debt security, it must evaluate expected cash flows to be received and determine if a credit loss has occurred. An unrealized loss is generally deemed to be other-than-temporary and a credit loss is deemed to exist if the present value of the expected future cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis of the debt security. For available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities the Corporations intends to hold, the credit loss component of an OTTI, if any, is recorded as net impairment losses on debt securities in the statements of income, while the remaining portion of the impairment loss is recognized in OCI, net of taxes, and included as a component of stockholders' equity. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings is the new amortized cost basis of the investment. The new amortized cost basis is not\nadjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Subsequent increases and decreases (if not an OTTI) in the fair value of available-for-sale securities is included in other comprehensive income. For held-to-maturity debt securities, any OTTI recognized in OCI should be accreted from other comprehensive income to the amortized cost of the debt security over the remaining life of the debt security. However, for debt securities for which OTTI was recognized in earnings, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as interest income as long as the security is not placed in nonaccrual status. Debt securities held by the Corporation at year-end primarily consisted of securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities, private label mortgage-backed securities ( MBS\u201d), certain bonds issued by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority, a government instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and obligations of certain municipalities in Puerto Rico. Given the explicit and implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. federal government, the Corporation believes the credit risk in securities issued by the U.S. government-sponsored entities is low. The Corporation's OTTI assessment was concentrated on Puerto Rico government debt securities and private label MBS. For further information, including methodology and assumptions used for the discounted cash flow analyses performed on these securities, refer to Note 5 - Investment Securities, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Corporation is required to estimate income taxes in preparing its consolidated financial statements. This involves the estimation of current income tax expense together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differences in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The determination of current income tax expense involves estimates and assumptions that require the Corporation to assume certain positions based on its interpretation of current tax regulations. Management assesses the relative benefits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance, and recognizes tax benefits only when deemed probable. Changes in assumptions affecting estimates may be required in the future and estimated tax liabilities may need to be increased or decreased accordingly. The accrual of tax contingencies is adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. The Corporation's effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingencies and changes to such accruals, as considered appropriate by management. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by the taxing authorities and finally resolved. Favorable resolution of such matters or the expiration of the statute of limitations may result in the release of tax contingencies that are recognized as a reduction to the Corporation's effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.\nIncome tax expense includes Puerto Rico and USVI income taxes as well as applicable U.S. federal and state taxes. The Corporation is subject to Puerto Rico income tax on its income from all sources. As a Puerto Rico corporation, First BanCorp. is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. and USVI income tax purposes and, accordingly, is generally subject to U.S. and USVI income tax only on its income from sources within the U.S. and USVI or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in those jurisdictions. Any such tax paid in the U.S. and USVI is also creditable against the Corporation's Puerto Rico tax liability, subject to certain conditions and limitations.\nUnder the 2011 PR Code, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are generally not entitled to file consolidated tax returns. Thus, the Corporation is generally not entitled to utilize losses from one subsidiary to offset gains in another subsidiary. Accordingly, in order to obtain a tax benefit from an NOL, a particular subsidiary must be able to demonstrate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL carry-forward period. Pursuant to the 2011 PR Code, the carryforward period for NOLs incurred during taxable years that commenced after December 31, 2004 and ended before January 1, 2013 is 12 years; for NOLs incurred during taxable years commencing after December 31, 2012 the carryover period is 10 years. The 2011 PR Code allows an entity organized as a limited liability company to elect to become a non-taxable pass-through\u201d entity and utilize losses to offset income from other pass-through\u201d entities, subject to certain limitations, with the remaining net income passing-through to its partner entities. The 2011 PR Code also provides a dividend received deduction of 100% on dividends received from controlled\u201d subsidiaries subject to taxation in Puerto Rico and 85% on dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations.\nThe Corporation has maintained an effective tax rate lower than the maximum statutory rate, mainly by investing in government obligations and MBS exempt from U.S. and Puerto Rico income taxes and by doing business through an IBE unit of the Bank, and through the Bank's subsidiary, FirstBank Overseas Corporation, whose interest income and gain on sales is exempt from Puerto Rico income taxation. The IBE and FirstBank Overseas Corporation were created under the International Banking Entity Act of Puerto Rico, which provides for total Puerto Rico tax exemption on net income derived by IBEs operating in Puerto Rico on the specific activities identified in the IBE Act. An IBE that operates as a unit of a bank pays income taxes at the corporate standard rate to the extent that the IBE's net income exceeds 20% of the bank's total net taxable income.\nThe determination of deferred tax expense or benefit is based on changes in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that generate temporary differences. The carrying value of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset assumes that the Corporation will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income based on estimates and assumptions. If these estimates and related assumptions change, the Corporation may be required to record valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income\ntax expense in the consolidated statements of income. Management evaluates its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for a valuation allowance, if any. A valuation allowance is established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance from period to period are included in the Corporation's tax provision in the period of change.\nAfter completion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance analysis for the fourth quarter of 2018, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, it is more likely than not that FirstBank will generate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL carry-forward periods to realize $220.5 million of its deferred tax assets related to NOLs and, therefore, reversed $63.2 million of the valuation allowance. The decision to partially reverse the valuation allowance was reached after weighting all of the evidence and determining that the positive evidence out-weighted the negative evidence. The positive evidence considered by management in arriving at its decision to reverse part of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance includes factors such as: FirstBank's three-year cumulative income position; sustained periods of profitability following the hurricane events in 2017; and, forecasts of future profitability, under several potential scenarios, that support significant utilization of NOLs prior to their expiration ranging between the years 2021 through 2024. The negative evidence considered by management includes: uncertainties around the state of the Puerto Rico economy, including the effect of hurricane recovery funds together with Puerto Rico government debt renegotiation efforts and the ultimate sustainability of the approved Fiscal Plan; and consideration of the Corporation's still elevated levels of non-performing assets.\nThe authoritative accounting guidance prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of income tax uncertainties with respect to positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax returns. Under this guidance, income tax benefits are recognized and measured based on a two-step analysis: 1) a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized; and 2) the benefit is measured at the largest dollar amount of the position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized in accordance with this analysis and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an Unrecognized Tax Benefit ( UTB\u201d). The Corporation classifies interest and penalties, if any, related to UTBs as components of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation did not have any UTBs recorded on its books.\nRefer to Note 26 - Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to Income Taxes.\nClassification and Related Values of Investment Securities\nManagement determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase. Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when the Corporation has the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity ( HTM\u201d) securities are stated at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading when the Corporation has the intent to sell the securities in the near term. Debt classified as trading securities, if any, are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt securities not classified as HTM or trading are classified as available for sale ( AFS\u201d). AFS securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of deferred taxes in accumulated OCI (a component of stockholders' equity), and do not affect earnings until realized or are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. New accounting guidance with respect to the accounting for equity securities effective beginning on January 1, 2018 requires the measurement of equity investments at fair value through net income, with certain exceptions, thus, eliminating eligibility for the available-for-sale category. Investments in equity securities that do not have publicly or readily determinable fair values are classified as equity securities in the statement of financial condition and carried at the lower of cost or realizable value. The assessment of fair value applies to certain of the Corporation's assets and liabilities, including the investment portfolio. Fair values are volatile and are affected by factors such as market interest rates, the rates at which prepayments occur and discount rates.\nValuation of financial instruments\nThe measurement of fair value is fundamental to the Corporation's presentation of its financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation holds fixed income and equity securities, derivatives, investments, and other financial instruments at fair value. The Corporation holds its investments and liabilities mainly to manage liquidity needs and interest rate risks. A significant part of the Corporation's total assets is reflected at fair value on the Corporation's financial statements.\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nInvestment securities available for sale\nThe fair value of investment securities available for sale was the market value based on quoted market prices (as is the case with Treasury notes, and non-callable U.S. Agency debt securities), when available (Level 1), or, when available, market prices for identical or comparable assets (as is the case with MBS and callable U.S. agency debt) that are based on observable market parameters, including benchmark yields, reported trades, quotes from brokers", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of First BanCorp. and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and the notes thereto. This section also presents certain financial measures that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). See Basis of Presentation\u201d below for information about why the non-GAAP financial measures are being presented and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures for which the reconciliation is not presented earlier.\nDescription of Business\nFirst BanCorp. is a diversified financial holding company headquartered in San Juan, Puerto Rico offering a full range of financial products to consumers and commercial customers through various subsidiaries. First BanCorp. is the holding company (the Holding Company\u201d) of FirstBank Puerto Rico and FirstBank Insurance Agency. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Corporation operates offices in Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands, and the State of Florida (USA), concentrating on commercial banking, residential mortgage loan originations, finance leases, credit cards, personal loans, small loans, auto loans, and insurance agency activities. On August 1, 2018, the Bank's Board of Directors approved a resolution to dissolve the broker-dealer subsidiary FirstBank Securities. Accordingly, FirstBank Securities filed the required Form BDW for the withdrawal of its registration from the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and its license to operate as broker-dealer was terminated effective September 30, 2018. Management is in the process of completing the dissolution of FirstBank Securities as a legal entity under the state laws.\nEXECUTIVE Overview of Results of Operations\nFirst BanCorp.'s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest-earning assets, including investment securities and loans, and the interest expense incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by various factors, including: the interest rate scenario; the volumes, mix and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; and the re-pricing characteristics of these assets and liabilities. The Corporation's results of operations also depend on the provision for loan and lease losses, non-interest expenses (such as personnel, occupancy, the deposit insurance premium and other costs), non-interest income (mainly service charges and fees on deposits, and insurance income), gains (losses) on sales of investments, gains (losses) on mortgage banking activities, and income taxes.\nThe Corporation had net income of $201.6 million, or $0.92 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a $67.0 million, or $0.30 per diluted common share, for 2017, and $93.2 million, or $0.43 per diluted common share, for 2016.\nThe key drivers of the Corporation's GAAP financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, include the following:\n\u00b7 Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $525.4 million compared to $491.6 million and $484.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by: (i) a $17.2 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans, primarily associated with the upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans; (ii) a $9.1 million increase in interest income on investment securities, primarily due to the gradual reinvestment of liquidity and proceeds from maturing debt securities into higher-yielding U.S. agencies debt securities and MBS; (iii) a $7.5 million increase in interest income on consumer loans, mainly due to a $77.8 million increase in the average balance of this portfolio, primarily auto loans and finance leases; and (iv) a $6.5 million increase in interest income from interest-bearing cash balances, primarily deposits maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, due to both a higher average balance and increases in the Federal Funds target rate.\nThese variances were partially offset by: (i) a $3.7 million decrease in interest income on residential mortgage loans, primarily associated with an $81.2 million decrease in the average balance of this portfolio; and (ii) a $2.7 million increase in total interest expense, driven an increase in the use of long-term FHLB advances during 2018 and higher market interest rates on the cost of retail CDs and commercial money market accounts tied to variable short-term interest rates, partially offset by a $480.3 million decrease in the average balance of brokered CDs.\nThe net interest margin increased to 4.55% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 4.36% for 2017, primarily due to the aforementioned upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans, the gradual reinvestment of liquidity in higher-yielding securities, and an improved funding mix, driven by the increase in the proportion of interest-earning assets funded by the growth in non-interest bearing deposits.\nThe increase for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by: (i) a $12.5 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans, primarily associated with both the upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans and the growth of the performing commercial portfolios, primarily in the Florida region; (ii) a $4.3 million decrease in interest expense, including a decrease of $2.8 million in interest expense on brokered CDs, primarily related to a $509.0 million decrease in the average balance of brokered CDs that offset higher costs on new issuances, and a $9.3 million decrease in interest expense on repurchase agreements, primarily reflecting the full-year effect of the repayment of $400 million of repurchase agreements that matured in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and carried an average cost of 3.35%, partially offset by increases of $5.2 million and $2.0 million in interest expense on FHLB advances and non-brokered deposits, respectively; and (iii) a $1.2 million increase in interest income from deposits maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, due to increases in the Federal Funds target rate in 2017 and late in 2016.\nThe aforementioned variances were partially offset by: (i) a $5.6 million decrease in interest income on consumer loans and finance leases, primarily reflecting a $33.5 million decrease in the average balance of this portfolio, primarily auto loans, and, to a lesser extent, the effect of a $1.4 million decrease in late payment fees as the Corporation did not assess late charges during the fourth quarter of 2017 to customers affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria that qualified for the three-month payment deferral program established by the Corporation after the hurricanes; and (ii) a $5.3 million decrease in interest income on residential mortgage loans, reflecting both a higher level of inflows of residential mortgage loans to non-performing status and a $41.8 million decrease in the average balance of this portfolio.\n\u00b7 The provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $59.3 million compared to $144.3 million and $86.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2018, the Corporation recorded a net loan loss reserve release of $16.9 million in connection with revised estimates of the hurricane-related qualitative reserves associated with the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, compared to hurricane-related charges to the provision of $71.3 million recorded in 2017. See Results of Operations - Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d below for details about the Corporation's approach to the estimation of hurricane-related qualitative reserves. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the aforementioned effects of the hurricane-related qualitative reserves, the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses for 2018 was $76.2 million compared to $73.0 million and $86.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by a $26.2 million increase in the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses for commercial and construction loans, driven by charges of $22.3 million related to developments in problem loans resolution strategies, including a $15.7 million charge on loans transferred to held for sale during 2018, partially offset by a $22.6 million decrease in the adjusted provision for residential mortgage loans, primarily reflecting a decline in charge-offs, nonaccrual and delinquent loan levels, and the overall decrease in the size of this portfolio.\nThe decrease in the adjusted provision for loan and lease losses for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by: (i) a $22.1 million decrease in the adjusted provision for commercial and construction loans reflecting, among other things, lower specific reserve requirements for impaired loans and a $2.9 million increase in loan loss recoveries; and (ii) a $2.8 million decrease in the adjusted provision for consumer loans and finance leases, mainly related to lower levels of personal and small loans delinquencies. These variances were partially offset by an $11.1 million increase in the adjusted provision for residential mortgage loans, primarily related to a higher level of residential nonaccrual loans, increased specific reserves for residential mortgage TDRs, and higher loss severity estimates in 2017.\nSee Basis of Presentation\u201d below for additional information and reconciliation of the provision for loan and lease losses in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP adjusted provision for loan and lease losses.\nNet charge-offs totaled $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 1.09% of average loans, a decrease of $23.3 million, compared to net charge-offs of $118.0 million, or 1.33% of average loans, for 2017 and $121.8 million, or 1.37% of average loans, for 2016. The decrease in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily reflects a $24.0 million decrease in net charge-offs taken on commercial and construction loans and a $4.4 million decrease in net charge-offs of residential mortgage loans, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in net charge-offs taken on consumer loans. During 2018, the Corporation recorded a loan loss recovery of $7.4 million on a commercial mortgage TDR loan paid off during the year compared to charge-offs of $27.3 million taken on such loan in 2017. This variance was partially offset by the effect in 2018 of charge-offs totaling $12.5 million taken on nonaccrual commercial and construction loans transferred to held for sale. See Results of Operations - Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d and Risk Management - Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Non-Performing Assets\u201d below for an analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses and non-performing assets and related ratios.\n\u00b7 The Corporation recorded non-interest income of $82.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $62.4 million and $88.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by: (i) the effect in 2017 of a $12.2 million other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) charge on three Puerto Rico Government debt securities, specifically bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority; (ii) a $3.7 million increase in revenues from mortgage banking activities, driven by adjustments recorded in 2018 that reduced the valuation allowance of mortgage servicing rights and higher servicing fees; (iii) a $3.6 million increase in fee-based income from ATMs, POS, credit and debit cards, and merchant-related activities; and (iv) a $1.2 million increase in gains from sales of fixed assets, primarily assets of relocated or closed banking branches in Florida and Puerto Rico. These variances were partially offset by a $2.8 million net loss recorded on sales of nonaccrual commercial and construction loans held for sale completed in 2018.\nThe decrease for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by: (i) a $6.9 million decrease in revenues from mortgage banking activities, primarily due to lower conforming loan origination and sales volume associated with both the drop in business activity in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands after the hurricanes and higher market interest rates; (ii) the effect in 2016 of a $6.1 million gain on sales of $198.7 million of U.S. agency MBS; (iii) a $5.9 million increase in OTTI charges on bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority; (iv) a $2.9 million decrease in gains associated with repurchases and cancellations of trust-preferred securities; (v) the effect in 2016 of a $1.5 million gain from the recovery of a residual collateralized mortgage obligation ( CMO\u201d) previously written off; and (vi) the effect in 2016 of brokerage and insurance commissions of $1.8 million, primarily related to the sale of large fixed annuities contracts.\n\u00b7 Non-interest expenses for 2018 were $357.8 million compared to $347.7 million and $355.1 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by: (i) a $7.6 million increase in employees' compensation and benefit expenses reflecting, among other things, salary merit increases and adjustments related to the Corporation's annual salary review process, higher headcount, and an increase in the Bank's matching contribution to the employees' retirement plans; (ii) a $3.5 million increase in losses from OREO operations reflecting, among other things, a $2.1 million increase in adverse fair value adjustments to the value of OREO properties and a $1.3 million increase in OREO operating expenses, including taxes, insurance and maintenance fees; (iii) a $2.3 million increase in business promotion expenses, primarily due to increased advertising, marketing, promotions and sponsorship-related activities during 2018; and (iv) a $1.3 million increase in occupancy and equipment costs, primarily due to hurricane-related expenses incurred in 2018 associated with repairs and security matters. These variances were partially offset by a $4.8 million decrease in the FDIC insurance premium expense due to, among other things, improved earnings trends, reduction in brokered CDs, and higher liquidity levels tied to the growth in non-interest bearing deposits.\nThe decrease for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to: (i) a $6.3 million decrease in the FDIC insurance premium expense, mainly related to the effect of reductions in brokered deposits and average assets, a strengthened capital position, and improved liquidity metrics; (ii) a $2.1 million decrease in the provision for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit; (iii) a $0.8 million decrease in write-downs, loss on sales and expenses related to non-real estate repossessed assets; (iv) a $0.6 million decrease in communications-related matters such as telephone and postage expenses; (v) a $0.6 million decrease in taxes, other than income taxes, primarily related to decreases in the sales and use tax expense and in municipal license taxes in Puerto Rico; (vi) a $0.5 million decrease in losses from OREO operations, primarily reflecting a $1.8 million decrease in write-downs to the value of OREO properties, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in rental income from commercial OREO income-producing properties; and (vii) a $0.4 million decrease in credit and debit card processing expenses, primarily associated with a lower volume of transactions affected by the drop in business activity after the hurricanes in 2017. These variances were partially offset by: (i) a $1.8 million increase in professional service fees, primarily reflecting higher consulting fees related to the implementation of new technology systems and higher outsourcing fees related to network services; (ii) a $1.5 million increase in occupancy and equipment costs, primarily due to higher electricity expenses, property taxes and rental expenses; (iii) a $1.1 million increase in business promotion expenses, reflecting the effect in 2016 of a $2.7 million adjustment recorded to reduce the credit card rewards program liability due to the expiration of reward points earned by customers up to September 2013 (the conversion date of the credit card portfolio acquired from FIA in May 2012) and costs of approximately $1.0 million related to hurricane relief efforts and assistance to employees incurred in 2017, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease associated with lower advertising and marketing-related activities.\n\u00b7 For 2018, the Corporation recorded an income tax benefit of $11.0 million compared to income tax benefit of $5.0 million for 2017 and income tax expense of $37.0 million for 2016. The income tax benefit recorded in 2018 reflects, among other things, the effect of a $63.2 million benefit related to a partial reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, partially offset by a one-time charge of $9.9 million associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets resulting from the enactment of Act 257 (net of the $5.6 million related impact in the valuation allowance). The income tax benefit recorded in 2017 reflects the effect of the tax benefit related to hurricane-related charges to the provision for loan and lease losses and a $13.2 million tax benefit recorded as a result of the change in tax status of certain subsidiaries from taxable corporations to limited liability companies that have elected to be treated as partnerships for income tax purposes in Puerto Rico. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had a net deferred tax asset of $319.9 million (net of a valuation allowance of $100.7 million, including a valuation allowance of $68.1 million against the deferred tax assets of the Corporation's banking subsidiary, FirstBank). See Results of Operations - Income Taxes\u201d below for additional information.\n\u00b7 As of December 31, 2018, total assets were approximately $12.2 billion, a decrease of $17.7 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease primarily reflects a $130.2 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, largely driven by liquidity used for the repayment of $657.9 million of maturing brokered CDs, the repayment of $200 million of repurchase agreements, the repurchase of $23.8 million of trust-preferred securities, and liquidity reinvested in higher-yielding U.S. agencies debt and MBS, partially offset by liquidity obtained from the growth in non-interest bearing deposits. In addition, the OREO portfolio balance decreased by $16.5 million.\nThe aforementioned decreases were partially offset by a $51.6 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities, driven by purchases of U.S agencies MBS and debt securities, a $25.0 million increase in the net deferred tax asset, and a $17.9 million increase in total loans. The decrease in total loans reflects a growth of $168.6 million in the Florida region, partially offset by decreases of $103.4 million and $47.4 million in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, respectively. Total loans for 2018 reflect an increase in the consumer loan portfolio of $194.8 million, partially offset by reductions of $125.4 million and $51.6 million in the residential mortgage and commercial and construction loan portfolios, respectively. The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $35.5 million during 2018 reflecting, among other things, the effect of releases associated with revised estimates of the hurricane-related qualitative reserve. See Financial Condition and Operating Data Analysis - Assets\u201d below for additional information.\n\u00b7 As of December 31, 2018, total liabilities were $10.2 billion, a decrease of $193.3 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly related to: (i) a $594.9 million decrease in brokered CDs; (ii) a $149.9 million decrease in repurchase agreements; and (iii) the repurchase of $23.8 million of trust-preferred securities. These reductions were partially offset by a $318.2 million increase in deposits, excluding brokered CDs and government deposits, a $248.8 million increase in government deposits, and a $25.0 million increase in FHLB advances. A significant portion of the increase in non-brokered deposits was in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which grew 31%, or $561.8 million which, in part, reflects the effect of hurricane-related factors such as settlements of insurance claims and disaster relief funds. See Risk Management - Liquidity and Capital Adequacy\u201d below for additional information about the Corporation's funding sources.\n\u00b7 As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation's stockholders' equity was $2.0 billion, an increase of $175.6 million from December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly driven by the earnings generated in 2018, partially offset by the decrease in the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities recorded as part of other comprehensive loss in total equity and dividends paid on preferred and common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2018, for the first time since June 2009, the Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per common share, or an aggregate of $6.5 million. In addition, the Corporation continued to pay monthly dividends on its non-cumulative perpetual monthly income preferred stock totaling $2.7 million in 2018. The Corporation's Total Capital, Common equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Leverage ratios calculated under the Basel III rules were 24.00%, 20.30%, 20.71%, and 15.37%, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, compared to Total Capital, Common equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Leverage ratios of 22.53%, 18.96%, 18.97%, and 14.03%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. The Corporation's tangible common equity ratio increased to 16.14% as of December 31, 2018, from 14.65% as of December 31, 2017. See Risk Management - Capital\u201d below for additional information.\n\u00b7 Total loan production, including purchases, refinancings, renewals and draws from existing revolving and non-revolving commitments, was $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, excluding the utilization activity on outstanding credit cards. Total loan originations in the Puerto Rico region of $2.4 billion increased by $304.4 million, compared to 2017. The growth in the Puerto Rico region consisted of increases of $237.6 million, $45.5 million, and $21.3 million in consumer, residential, and commercial loans, respectively. In addition, total loan originations in the Virgin Islands increased by $26.9 million. Total loan originations in the Florida region decreased by $92.4 million, primarily reflected in lower residential mortgage loan originations.\n\u00b7 Total non-performing assets were $467.1 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $183.5 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to: (i) the restoration to accrual status of two large commercial loans totaling $69.7 million; (ii) sales of $61.9 million of nonaccrual commercial and construction loans held for sale; (iii) collections on commercial and construction nonaccrual loans of $32.3 million; (iv) commercial and construction nonaccrual loan charge-offs totaling $40.3 million; (v) a $31.0 million decrease in residential nonaccrual loans, and (vi) a $16.5 million decrease in the OREO portfolio balance. These variances were partially offset by the inflow of two large commercial mortgage loans totaling $69.8 million related to a legacy commercial loan relationship that operates in both the Florida and Puerto Rico regions with independent sources of repayment. See Risk Management - Non-accruing and Non-performing Assets\u201d below for additional information.\n\u00b7 Adversely classified commercial and construction loans, including loans held for sale, decreased by $126.4 million to $356.0 million as of December 31, 2018, driven primarily by the sale of five large commercial and construction loans totaling $66.1 million, the upgrade in the credit risk classification of several commercial loans totaling $125.7 million, and collections and charge-offs recorded during 2018. These variances were partially offset by the downgrade in the credit risk classification of three large commercial loans totaling $110.4 million, including the aforementioned $69.8 million in two large commercial loans classified as nonaccrual during 2018.\nThe Corporation's financial results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 included the following significant items that management believes are not reflective of core operating performance, are not expected to reoccur with any regularity or may reoccur at uncertain times and in uncertain amounts (the Special Items\u201d):\nYear ended December 31, 2018\n\u00b7 Tax benefit of $63.2 million resulting from the partial reversal of the Corporation's deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\n\u00b7 One-time charge to the income tax expense of $9.9 million related to the enactment of the Puerto Rico Tax Reform of 2018, specifically in connection with the reduction of the Corporation's deferred tax assets as a result of the decrease in the maximum corporate tax rate in Puerto Rico from 39% to 37.5%.\n\u00b7 Net loan loss reserve releases of $16.9 million ($10.3 million after-tax) in connection with revised estimates of the qualitative reserves associated with the effects of Hurricanes Maria and Irma.

of the Corporation and the methods of applying these principles conform to GAAP. The Corporation's critical accounting policies relate to: 1) the allowance for loan and lease losses; 2) OTTI; 3) income taxes; 4) the classification and values of financial instruments; 5) income recognition on loans; 6) loans acquired; and 7) loans held for sale. These critical accounting policies involve judgments, estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the amounts recorded for assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from estimates, if different assumptions or conditions prevail. Certain determinations inherently require greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than those originally reported.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe Corporation maintains the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level considered adequate to absorb incurred losses currently inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The Corporation does not maintain an allowance for held-for-sale loans or PCI loans that are performing in accordance with or better than expectations as of the date of acquisition, as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component. The allowance for loan and lease losses provides for probable incurred losses that have been identified with specific valuation allowances for individually evaluated impaired loans and for probable incurred losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio that have not been specifically identified. The determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses requires significant estimates, including with respect to the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, consideration of current economic conditions and business strategies, and historical loss experience pertaining to the portfolios and pools of homogeneous loans, all of which may be susceptible to change.\nThe Corporation evaluates the need for changes to the allowance by portfolio loan segments and classes of loans within certain of those portfolio segments. The Corporation combines loans with similar credit risk characteristics into the following portfolio segments: commercial mortgage, construction, commercial and industrial, residential mortgage, and consumer loans. Classes are usually disaggregations of the portfolio segments. The classes within the residential mortgage segment are residential mortgages guaranteed by the U.S. government and other residential loans. The classes within the consumer portfolio are auto, finance lease, and other consumer loans. Other consumer loans mainly include unsecured personal loans, credit cards, home equity lines, lines of credits, and marine financing. The classes within the construction loan portfolio are land loans, construction of commercial projects, and construction of residential projects. The commercial mortgage and commercial and industrial segments are not further segmented into classes. The adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is based on judgments related to the credit quality of each portfolio segment. These judgments consider ongoing evaluations of each portfolio segment, including such factors as the economic risks associated with each loan class, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the geography (Puerto Rico, Florida or the Virgin Islands), the level of delinquent loans, historical loss experience, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. In addition to the general economic conditions and other factors described above, additional factors considered include the internal risk ratings assigned to loans. An internal risk rating is assigned to each commercial and construction loan at the time of approval and is subject to subsequent periodic review by the Corporation's senior management. The allowance for loan and lease losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis as part of the Corporation's continued evaluation of its asset quality.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through a provision for credit losses that is charged to earnings, based on the quarterly evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, and is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses consists of specific reserves based upon valuations of loans considered to be impaired and general reserves. A specific valuation allowance is established for individual impaired loans in the commercial mortgage, construction, and commercial and industrial portfolios and certain boat loans, residential mortgage loans, and home equity lines of credit, primarily when the collateral value of the loan (if the impaired loan is determined to be collateral dependent) or the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective rate is lower than the carrying amount of that loan. The loans within the commercial mortgage, construction, and commercial and industrial portfolios, and boat loans of $1 million or more are individually evaluated for impairment. Also, certain residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit are individually evaluated for impairment purposes based on their delinquency and loan to value levels. When foreclosure of a collateral dependent loan is probable, the impairment measure is based on the fair value of the collateral. The fair value of the collateral is generally obtained from appraisals. Updated appraisals are obtained when the Corporation determines that loans are impaired and are generally updated annually thereafter according to the Corporation's appraisal policy. In addition, appraisals and/or appraiser price opinions are also obtained for residential mortgage loans based on specific characteristics such as delinquency levels, age of the appraisal, and loan-to-value ratios. The excess of the recorded investment in a collateral dependent loan over the resulting fair value of the collateral is charged-off when deemed uncollectible.\nFor all other loans, which include small, homogeneous loans, such as auto loans, and the other classes in the consumer loan portfolio, residential mortgages and commercial and construction loans not individually evaluated for impairment, the Corporation\nmaintains a general valuation allowance established through a process that begins with estimates of incurred losses based upon various statistical analyses. The general reserve is primarily determined by applying loss factors according to the loan type and assigned risk category (pass, special mention, and substandard loans that are not considered to be impaired; all doubtful loans are considered impaired).\nThe Corporation uses a roll-rate methodology to estimate losses on its consumer loan portfolio based on delinquencies and considering credit bureau score bands. The Corporation tracks the historical portfolio performance to arrive at a weighted-average distribution in each subgroup of each delinquency bucket. Roll-to-loss rates (loss factors) are calculated by multiplying the roll rates from each subgroup within the delinquency buckets forward through loss. Once roll rates are calculated, the resulting loss factor is applied to the existing receivables in the applicable subgroups within the delinquency buckets and the end results are aggregated to arrive at the required allowance level. The Corporation's assessment also involves evaluating key qualitative and environmental factors, which include credit and macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment, bankruptcy trends, recent market transactions, and collateral values to account for current market conditions that are likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical loss experience. The Corporation analyzes the expected delinquency migration to determine the future volume of delinquencies.\nThe cash flow analysis for each residential mortgage pool is performed at the individual loan level and then aggregated to the pool level in determining the overall loss ratio (the base methodology\u201d). The model applies risk-adjusted prepayment curves, default curves, and severity curves to each loan in the pool. For loan restructuring pools, the present value of future cash flows under the new terms, at the loan's effective interest rate, is taken into consideration. Additionally, estimates of default risk and prepayments related to loan restructurings are based on, among other things, the historical experience of these loans. Loss severity is affected by the house price scenario, which is based in part on recent house price trends. Default curves are used in the model. The attributes that are most significant to the probability of default include present collection status (current, delinquent, in bankruptcy, in foreclosure stage), vintage, loan-to-values, and geography (Puerto Rico, Florida or the Virgin Islands). The estimates of the risk-adjusted timing of liquidations and associated costs are used in the model, and are risk-adjusted for the geographic area in which each property is located.\nFor commercial loans, historical charge-off rates are calculated by the Corporation on a quarterly basis for each commercial loan regulatory-based credit risk category (i.e. pass, special mention, substandard, and doubtful) using the historical charge-offs and portfolio balances over their average loss emergence period (the raw loss rate\u201d) for each credit risk classification. However, when not enough loss experience is observed in a particular risk-rated category and the calculation results in a loss rate for such risk-rated category that is lower than the loss rate of a less severe risk-rated category, the Corporation uses the loss rate of such less severe category. A qualitative factor adjustment is applied to the base rate average utilizing a resulting factor derived from a set of risk-based ratings and weights assigned to credit and economic indicators over a reasonable period applied to a developed expected range of historical losses and a basis point adjustment derived from the difference between the average raw loss rate and the highest loss rate observed during a look-back period that management determined was appropriate to use for each region to identify any relevant effect during an economic cycle.\nHurricane-related Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nDuring 2017, management established a separate qualitative element of the allowance to estimate inherent losses associated with the effect of Hurricanes Maria and Irma on the Corporation's loan portfolios in Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands. This qualitative element of the allowance was initially determined based on the estimated effect that the hurricanes could have on employment levels (e.g., an unemployment rate that significantly increases from levels in Puerto Rico at the time of the hurricanes based on statistics observed in the aftermath of similar natural disasters in the U.S. mainland like Hurricane Katrina), economic activity in the Corporation's geographic regions, and the time it could take for the affected regions to return to a more normalized operating environment.\nFor large commercial and construction loan relationships, loan officers performed individual reviews of the effect of the hurricanes on these borrowers' sources of repayment. These large relationships, that represented 80% of the outstanding balance of the Corporation's commercial and construction loan portfolio at the time of the hurricanes, were analyzed and divided into three hurricane-affected categories (i.e. Low, Medium and High). Clients categorized as Low had no effect, or relatively insignificant effect, as a result of the storms. Clients in the Medium category had demonstrated that they had sufficient liquidity to satisfy their obligations, but the complexity of the insurance claim process may affect their primary or secondary source of repayment. Finally, clients categorized as High could potentially have problems with their primary or secondary sources of repayment as they have a higher degree of uncertainty with respect to the timing of the insurance claim resolution, and the full reestablishment of their businesses is highly dependent on the timely receipt of insurance proceeds. Reserve levels were then recognized for these particular loans based on this stratification. For loans in the Low category, no additional qualitative hurricane-related reserve was calculated. For loans in the Medium and High categories, the Corporation stressed the general reserve loss factors applicable to these loans to reflect higher default probabilities not reflected in the historical data.\nThis review also resulted in downgrades in the credit risk classification of certain loans and their reserves were determined following the methodology applicable to criticized and adversely classified loans, as appropriate.\nDuring 2018, the Corporation performed additional procedures to evaluate the adequacy of the qualitative reserve, including the consideration of updated payment patterns and probability of default credit risk analyses applied to consumer loan borrowers subject to payment deferral programs that expired early in 2018. For the determination of the hurricane-related qualitative reserve for residential mortgage loans as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation stressed the loss factors derived from its above-described base methodology by incorporating assumptions of further deterioration in the housing price index and higher loan modification levels. Although the foreclosure moratoriums extended by the FHA to hurricane-affected individuals ended on September 15, 2018, there are likely to be additional delays in foreclosure actions due to court-related backlogs. For the determination of the hurricane-related qualitative reserve for commercial and construction loans not individually reviewed as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation segregated the portfolio based on delinquency levels and stressed the general reserve loss factors applicable to 30-89 days past due loans to reflect higher default probabilities.\nAs a result of the aforementioned analyses, the Corporation recorded a net loan loss reserve release of $16.9 million in 2018 and a charge to the provision of $71.3 million in 2017 associated with the hurricanes. As of December 31, 2018, the hurricane-related qualitative allowance was $19.2 million (2017 - $55.6 million). See Results of Operations - Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d below for additional information, including details about the hurricane-related qualitative allowance segregated by loans portfolio segments.\nCharge-off of Uncollectible Loans - Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balances of loans held for investment that the Corporation determines are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Collateral dependent loans in the construction, commercial mortgage, and commercial and industrial loan portfolios are charged off to their net realizable value (fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell) when loans are considered to be uncollectible. Within the consumer loan portfolio, auto loans and finance leases are reserved once they are 120 days delinquent and are charged off to their estimated net realizable value when the collateral deficiency is deemed uncollectible (i.e., when foreclosure/repossession is probable) or when the loan is 365 days past due. Within the other consumer loan portfolio, closed-end loans are charged off when payments are 120 days in arrears, except small personal loans. Open-end (revolving credit) consumer loans, including credit card loans, and small personal loans are charged off when payments are 180 days in arrears. On a quarterly basis, residential mortgage loans that are 180 days delinquent and have an original loan-to-value ratio that is higher than 60% are reviewed and charged-off, as needed, to the fair value of the underlying collateral. Generally, all loans may be charged off or written down to the fair value of the collateral prior to the application of the policies described above if a loss-confirming event has occurred. Loss-confirming events include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy (unsecured), continued delinquency, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency when the asset is the sole source of repayment. The Corporation does not record charge-offs on PCI loans that are performing in accordance with or better than expectations as of the date of acquisition, as the fair value of these loans already reflects a credit component. The Corporation records charge-offs on PCI loans only if actual losses exceed estimated losses incorporated into the fair value recorded at acquisition and the amount is deemed uncollectible.\nOther-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI\u201d)\nOn a quarterly basis, the Corporation performs an assessment to determine whether there have been any events or economic circumstances indicating that a security with an unrealized loss has suffered an OTTI. A security is considered impaired if the fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. The Corporation employs a systematic methodology that considers all available evidence in evaluating a potential impairment of its investments.\nThe impairment analysis of debt securities places special emphasis on the analysis of the cash position of the issuer and its cash and capital generation capacity, which could increase or diminish the issuer's ability to repay its bond obligations, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, any adverse change to the credit conditions and liquidity of the issuer, taking into consideration the latest information available about the financial condition of the issuer, credit ratings, the failure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments, recent legislation and government actions affecting the issuer's industry, and actions taken by the issuer to deal with the economic climate. The Corporation also takes into consideration changes in the near-term prospects of the underlying collateral of a security, if any, such as changes in default rates, loss severity given default, and significant changes in prepayment assumptions and the level of cash flows generated from the underlying collateral, if any, supporting the principal and interest payments of the debt securities. OTTI must be recognized in earnings if the Corporation has the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. However, even if the Corporation does not expect to sell a debt security, it must evaluate expected cash flows to be received and determine if a credit loss has occurred. An unrealized loss is generally deemed to be other-than-temporary and a credit loss is deemed to exist if the present value of the expected future cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis of the debt security. For available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities the Corporations intends to hold, the credit loss component of an OTTI, if any, is recorded as net impairment losses on debt securities in the statements of income, while the remaining portion of the impairment loss is recognized in OCI, net of taxes, and included as a component of stockholders' equity. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings is the new amortized cost basis of the investment. The new amortized cost basis is not\nadjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Subsequent increases and decreases (if not an OTTI) in the fair value of available-for-sale securities is included in other comprehensive income. For held-to-maturity debt securities, any OTTI recognized in OCI should be accreted from other comprehensive income to the amortized cost of the debt security over the remaining life of the debt security. However, for debt securities for which OTTI was recognized in earnings, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as interest income as long as the security is not placed in nonaccrual status. Debt securities held by the Corporation at year-end primarily consisted of securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities, private label mortgage-backed securities ( MBS\u201d), certain bonds issued by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority, a government instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and obligations of certain municipalities in Puerto Rico. Given the explicit and implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. federal government, the Corporation believes the credit risk in securities issued by the U.S. government-sponsored entities is low. The Corporation's OTTI assessment was concentrated on Puerto Rico government debt securities and private label MBS. For further information, including methodology and assumptions used for the discounted cash flow analyses performed on these securities, refer to Note 5 - Investment Securities, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Corporation is required to estimate income taxes in preparing its consolidated financial statements. This involves the estimation of current income tax expense together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differences in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The determination of current income tax expense involves estimates and assumptions that require the Corporation to assume certain positions based on its interpretation of current tax regulations. Management assesses the relative benefits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance, and recognizes tax benefits only when deemed probable. Changes in assumptions affecting estimates may be required in the future and estimated tax liabilities may need to be increased or decreased accordingly. The accrual of tax contingencies is adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. The Corporation's effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingencies and changes to such accruals, as considered appropriate by management. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by the taxing authorities and finally resolved. Favorable resolution of such matters or the expiration of the statute of limitations may result in the release of tax contingencies that are recognized as a reduction to the Corporation's effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.\nIncome tax expense includes Puerto Rico and USVI income taxes as well as applicable U.S. federal and state taxes. The Corporation is subject to Puerto Rico income tax on its income from all sources. As a Puerto Rico corporation, First BanCorp. is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. and USVI income tax purposes and, accordingly, is generally subject to U.S. and USVI income tax only on its income from sources within the U.S. and USVI or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in those jurisdictions. Any such tax paid in the U.S. and USVI is also creditable against the Corporation's Puerto Rico tax liability, subject to certain conditions and limitations.\nUnder the 2011 PR Code, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are generally not entitled to file consolidated tax returns. Thus, the Corporation is generally not entitled to utilize losses from one subsidiary to offset gains in another subsidiary. Accordingly, in order to obtain a tax benefit from an NOL, a particular subsidiary must be able to demonstrate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL carry-forward period. Pursuant to the 2011 PR Code, the carryforward period for NOLs incurred during taxable years that commenced after December 31, 2004 and ended before January 1, 2013 is 12 years; for NOLs incurred during taxable years commencing after December 31, 2012 the carryover period is 10 years. The 2011 PR Code allows an entity organized as a limited liability company to elect to become a non-taxable pass-through\u201d entity and utilize losses to offset income from other pass-through\u201d entities, subject to certain limitations, with the remaining net income passing-through to its partner entities. The 2011 PR Code also provides a dividend received deduction of 100% on dividends received from controlled\u201d subsidiaries subject to taxation in Puerto Rico and 85% on dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations.\nThe Corporation has maintained an effective tax rate lower than the maximum statutory rate, mainly by investing in government obligations and MBS exempt from U.S. and Puerto Rico income taxes and by doing business through an IBE unit of the Bank, and through the Bank's subsidiary, FirstBank Overseas Corporation, whose interest income and gain on sales is exempt from Puerto Rico income taxation. The IBE and FirstBank Overseas Corporation were created under the International Banking Entity Act of Puerto Rico, which provides for total Puerto Rico tax exemption on net income derived by IBEs operating in Puerto Rico on the specific activities identified in the IBE Act. An IBE that operates as a unit of a bank pays income taxes at the corporate standard rate to the extent that the IBE's net income exceeds 20% of the bank's total net taxable income.\nThe determination of deferred tax expense or benefit is based on changes in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that generate temporary differences. The carrying value of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset assumes that the Corporation will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income based on estimates and assumptions. If these estimates and related assumptions change, the Corporation may be required to record valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income\ntax expense in the consolidated statements of income. Management evaluates its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for a valuation allowance, if any. A valuation allowance is established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance from period to period are included in the Corporation's tax provision in the period of change.\nAfter completion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance analysis for the fourth quarter of 2018, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, it is more likely than not that FirstBank will generate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL carry-forward periods to realize $220.5 million of its deferred tax assets related to NOLs and, therefore, reversed $63.2 million of the valuation allowance. The decision to partially reverse the valuation allowance was reached after weighting all of the evidence and determining that the positive evidence out-weighted the negative evidence. The positive evidence considered by management in arriving at its decision to reverse part of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance includes factors such as: FirstBank's three-year cumulative income position; sustained periods of profitability following the hurricane events in 2017; and, forecasts of future profitability, under several potential scenarios, that support significant utilization of NOLs prior to their expiration ranging between the years 2021 through 2024. The negative evidence considered by management includes: uncertainties around the state of the Puerto Rico economy, including the effect of hurricane recovery funds together with Puerto Rico government debt renegotiation efforts and the ultimate sustainability of the approved Fiscal Plan; and consideration of the Corporation's still elevated levels of non-performing assets.\nThe authoritative accounting guidance prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of income tax uncertainties with respect to positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax returns. Under this guidance, income tax benefits are recognized and measured based on a two-step analysis: 1) a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized; and 2) the benefit is measured at the largest dollar amount of the position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized in accordance with this analysis and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an Unrecognized Tax Benefit ( UTB\u201d). The Corporation classifies interest and penalties, if any, related to UTBs as components of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation did not have any UTBs recorded on its books.\nRefer to Note 26 - Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to Income Taxes.\nClassification and Related Values of Investment Securities\nManagement determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase. Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when the Corporation has the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity ( HTM\u201d) securities are stated at amortized cost. Debt securities are classified as trading when the Corporation has the intent to sell the securities in the near term. Debt classified as trading securities, if any, are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt securities not classified as HTM or trading are classified as available for sale ( AFS\u201d). AFS securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of deferred taxes in accumulated OCI (a component of stockholders' equity), and do not affect earnings until realized or are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. New accounting guidance with respect to the accounting for equity securities effective beginning on January 1, 2018 requires the measurement of equity investments at fair value through net income, with certain exceptions, thus, eliminating eligibility for the available-for-sale category. Investments in equity securities that do not have publicly or readily determinable fair values are classified as equity securities in the statement of financial condition and carried at the lower of cost or realizable value. The assessment of fair value applies to certain of the Corporation's assets and liabilities, including the investment portfolio. Fair values are volatile and are affected by factors such as market interest rates, the rates at which prepayments occur and discount rates.\nValuation of financial instruments\nThe measurement of fair value is fundamental to the Corporation's presentation of its financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation holds fixed income and equity securities, derivatives, investments, and other financial instruments at fair value. The Corporation holds its investments and liabilities mainly to manage liquidity needs and interest rate risks. A significant part of the Corporation's total assets is reflected at fair value on the Corporation's financial statements.\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nInvestment securities available for sale\nThe fair value of investment securities available for sale was the market value based on quoted market prices (as is the case with Treasury notes, and non-callable U.S. Agency debt securities), when available (Level 1), or, when available, market prices for identical or comparable assets (as is the case with MBS and callable U.S. agency debt) that are based on observable market parameters, including benchmark yields, reported trades, quotes from brokers"}
