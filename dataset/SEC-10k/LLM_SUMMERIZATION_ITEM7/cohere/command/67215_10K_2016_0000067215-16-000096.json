Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, as well as Part I, Item 1, Business, and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntroduction\nWe are a leading provider of specialty contracting services throughout the United States and in Canada. Our subsidiary companies provide program management, engineering, construction, maintenance, and installation services for telecommunications providers, underground facility locating services for various utilities, including telecommunications providers, and other construction and maintenance services for electric and gas utilities. We provide the labor, tools and equipment necessary to design, engineer, locate, maintain, expand, install and upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure of our customers.\nSignificant developments in consumer applications within the telecommunications industry, including advanced digital and video service offerings, continue to increase the demand for greater capacity and enhanced reliability from our customers' wireline and wireless networks. Telecommunications providers outsource a significant portion of their engineering, construction, maintenance, and installation requirements, driving demand for our services.\nTelecommunications network operators are increasingly deploying fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers and businesses in order to respond to consumer demand, competitive realities, and public policy support. Several large telephone companies have pursued fiber-to-the-premise and fiber-to-the-node initiatives to compete actively with cable operators. Some telephone companies, which have previously deployed fiber-to-the-node architectures, have definitively transitioned to fiber-to-the-home architectures, while others are beginning to provision video over their fiber-to-the-node architectures. Cable companies continue to increase the speeds of their services to residential customers and to deploy fiber to business customers with increasing urgency. Many industry participants are deploying networks designed to provision 1 gigabit speeds to individual consumers and some have articulated plans to deploy speeds beyond 1-gigabit.\nOpportunities exist to improve rural networks as a result of Phase II of the Connect America Fund. This six-year program, administered by the Federal Communications Commission, will provide $1.676 billion in funding per year to price cap carriers and others to expand and support broadband deployments in rural areas. In aggregate, our current customers, including several of our top ten customers, have accepted over $1.496 billion in funding per year under this program. New projects resulting from the Connect America Fund Phase II are in planning, engineering, and construction. These projects are deploying fiber deeper into rural networks, and more are expected as new multi-year opportunities emerge. These opportunities also include fixed wireless deployments. We expect this program to contribute to demand for services in our industry.\nSignificant demand for wireless broadband is driven by the proliferation of smart phones and other mobile data devices. Wireless carriers are actively spending on their networks to respond to the significant increase in wireless data traffic, to upgrade network technologies to improve performance and efficiency, and to consolidate disparate technology platforms. As the demand for mobile broadband grows, the amount of wireless traffic that must be backhauled\u201d over customers' fiber networks increases and, as a result, carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites and small cells. These trends are driving demand for our services and the increasing wireless data traffic is prompting further wireline deployments.\nThe cyclical nature of the industry we serve may affect demand for our services. The capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers, and the related timing of approvals and seasonal spending patterns, influence our revenues and results of operations. The business demands of our customers and the demands of their consumers, the introduction of new communication technologies, the physical maintenance needs of customer infrastructure, the actions of our government and the FCC, and overall economic conditions may affect the capital expenditures and maintenance budgets of our telecommunications\ncustomers. Changes in our mix of customers, contracts, and business activities, as well as changes in the general level of construction activity also drive variations in revenues and results of operations.\nCustomer Relationships and Contractual Arrangements\nWe have established relationships with many leading telecommunications providers, including telephone companies, cable television multiple system operators, wireless carriers, telecommunication equipment and infrastructure providers, and electric and gas utilities. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers in each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 accounting for approximately 69.7%, 61.1% and 58.3% of our total revenues, respectively. The following reflects the percentage of total revenue from customers who contributed at least 2.5% to our total revenue during fiscal 2016, 2015, or 2014:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AT&T Inc.\n</td> <td>24.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CenturyLink, Inc.\n</td> <td>14.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comcast Corporation\n</td> <td>13.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Verizon Communications Inc.\n</td> <td>11.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charter Communications, Inc.(1)\n</td> <td>6.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Windstream Corporation\n</td> <td>5.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) For comparison purposes in the above table, revenues from Charter Communications, Inc., Time Warner Cable Inc., and Bright House Networks, LLC have been combined for periods prior to their May 2016 merger.\nIn addition, another customer contributed 6.2%, 5.6%, and 3.2% to our total revenue during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nWe generally possess multiple agreements with each of our significant customers. To the extent that such agreements specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the customer's ability to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, the performance of work with the customer's own employees, and the use of other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility. In most cases, a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience with written notice. Historically, multi-year master service agreements have been awarded primarily through a competitive bidding process, however, we occasionally are able to extend these agreements through negotiations. Revenues from multi-year master service agreements were approximately 61.4% during fiscal 2016, and 65.2% during each of fiscal 2015 and 2014.\nWe provide the remainder of our services pursuant to contracts for specific projects. These contracts may be long-term (with terms greater than one year) or short-term (with terms generally three to four months in duration) and often include customary retainage provisions under which the customer may withhold 5% to 10% of the invoiced amounts pending project completion. Revenues from long-term contracts for specific projects were 19.6%, 14.7%, and 13.7%, as a percentage of total contract revenues during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. We regularly review opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify, acquire, and successfully integrate companies.\nFiscal 2016 - During August 2015, we acquired TelCom Construction, Inc. and an affiliate (together, TelCom\u201d). The purchase price was $48.8 million paid in cash. TelCom, based in Clearwater, Minnesota, provides construction and maintenance services for telecommunications providers throughout the United States. This acquisition expands our geographical presence within our existing customer base. During July 2016, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with the wireless network deployment and wireline operations of Goodman Networks Incorporated ( Goodman\u201d) for a cash purchase price of $107.5 million, subject to working capital adjustments. The total cash transaction consideration paid was $102.8 million after a preliminary working capital adjustment of $4.7 million. The acquired operations\nprovide wireless construction services in a number of markets, including Texas, Georgia, and Southern California. The acquisition reinforces our wireless construction resources and expands our geographical presence within our existing customer base. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we acquired NextGen Telecom Services Group, Inc. ( NextGen\u201d) for $5.6 million, net of cash acquired. NextGen provides construction and maintenance services for telecommunications providers in the Northeastern United States.\nWith respect to the Goodman acquisition, $22.5 million of the purchase price was placed into an escrow account, $2.5 million of which is available for working capital adjustments and $20.0 million of which is available to us for indemnification obligations of the seller. Of the $20.0 million available for indemnification obligations, $10.0 million will be released to the seller upon the occurrence of certain conditions, but in no event earlier than the twelve-month anniversary of the closing date. The remaining $10.0 million will be released to the seller when the seller satisfies certain conditions with respect to a dispute with the state of Texas over a sales tax liability of approximately $31.7 million (the Sales Tax Liability\u201d). Under the purchase agreement, Goodman has retained responsibility for this Sales Tax Liability. Should Goodman not resolve this matter, the state may assert that we are a successor to the operations and seek to recover from us. In such event we would seek indemnification for recovery from Goodman, including from the funds contained in the escrow account, for any amount we pay.\nFiscal 2015 - During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we acquired Hewitt Power & Communications, Inc. ( Hewitt\u201d) for $8.0 million, net of cash acquired. Hewitt provides specialty contracting services primarily for telecommunications providers in the Southeastern United States. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we acquired the assets of two cable installation contractors for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we acquired Moll's Utility Services, LLC ( Moll's\u201d) for $6.5 million, net of cash acquired. Moll's provides specialty contracting services primarily for utilities in the Midwest United States. We also acquired the assets of Venture Communications Group, LLC ( Venture\u201d) for $15.6 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Venture provides specialty contracting services primarily for telecommunications providers in the Midwest and Southeastern United States.\nFiscal 2014 - During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired a telecommunications specialty construction contractor in Canada for $0.7 million. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired Watts Brothers Cable Construction, Inc. ( Watts Brothers\u201d) for $16.4 million. Watts Brothers provides specialty contracting services primarily for telecommunications providers in the Midwest and Southeastern United States.\nUnderstanding Our Results of Operations\nThe following information is presented in order for the reader to better understand certain factors impacting our results of operations and profitability, and should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below as well as Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues. We perform a majority of our services under master service agreements and other agreements that contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discrete pricing for individual tasks. Revenue is recognized under these arrangements based on units-of-delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed. The remainder of our services are performed under contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting as more fully described within Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below.\nCost of Earned Revenues. Cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts, including costs for direct labor provided by employees, services by independent subcontractors, operation of capital equipment (excluding depreciation), direct materials, insurance costs, and other direct costs. For claims within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), workers' compensation, and employee group health.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses, including performance-based compensation and stock-based compensation, legal, consulting and professional fees, information technology and development costs, provision for or recoveries of bad debt expense, acquisition and integration costs of businesses acquired, and other costs not directly related to the provision of our services under customer contracts. We incur information technology and development costs primarily to support and enhance our operating efficiency. To protect our rights, we have filed for patents on certain of our innovations. Our executive management team and the senior management of our subsidiaries perform substantially all of our sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Our property and equipment primarily consist of vehicles, equipment and machinery, and computer hardware and software. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. In addition, we have intangible assets, including customer relationships, contract backlog, trade names, and non-compete intangibles, which we amortize over the estimated useful lives. We recognize amortization of customer relationship intangibles and acquired contract backlog intangibles on an accelerated basis as a function of the expected economic benefit. We recognize amortization of our other finite-lived intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment. Loss on debt extinguishment for fiscal 2016 includes pre-tax charges related to the redemption of our 7.125% senior subordinated notes (the 7.125% Notes\u201d), including the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs on the 7.125% Notes.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, consists of interest incurred on outstanding variable rate and fixed rate debt and certain other obligations. Interest expense also includes non-cash amortization of our convertible senior notes debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs. See Note 10, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the non-cash amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net, primarily consists of gains or losses from sales of fixed assets. Other income, net during fiscal 2016 also includes immaterial discount fees related to a customer-sponsored vendor payment program in which we participate. Under this program, accounts receivable are collected on an expedited basis pursuant to a non-recourse sale of the receivables to a bank partner of the customer. The program significantly reduces the time required to collect that customer's receivables.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations. Our revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, extended periods of adverse weather, which are more likely to occur during the winter season, impact our operations during our second and third fiscal quarters. In addition, a disproportionate percentage of paid holidays fall within our second fiscal quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Because of these factors, we are most likely to experience reduced revenue and profitability during our second and third fiscal quarters.\nWe experience quarterly variations in revenues and results of operations as a result of other factors as well. Such factors include fluctuations in insurance expense due to changes in claims experience and actuarial assumptions, variances in incentive pay and stock-based compensation expense as a result of operating performance and vesting provisions, and changes in the employer portion of payroll taxes, including unemployment taxes, as a result of reaching statutory limits. Other factors that may contribute to quarterly variations in results of operations include other income recognized as a result of the timing and levels of capital assets sold during the period, income tax expense attributable to levels of taxable earnings, and the impact of disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock option expenses.\nAccordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal period.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions require the use of judgment as to the likelihood of various future outcomes and, as a result, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nWe have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The impact of these policies affects our reported and expected financial results. We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies herein.\nOther significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below, are also important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion.\nRevenue Recognition. We perform a majority of our services under master service agreements and other agreements that contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discrete pricing for individual tasks. We recognize revenue under these arrangements based on units-of-delivery as each unit is completed. The remainder of our services, representing less than 5% of our contract revenues during fiscal 2016 and less than 10% of our contract revenues during each of fiscal 2015 and 2014, are performed under contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting. Revenue is recognized under these arrangements based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. For contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of completion, we accrue the entire amount of a contract loss at the time the loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. During each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, there was no material impact to our results of operations due to changes in contract estimates.\nThere were no material amounts of unapproved change orders or claims recognized during each of fiscal 2016, 2015, or 2014. The current asset Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The current liability Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on uncollected balances. Management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable balances each period. This analysis considers the aging of account balances, historical bad debt experience, changes in customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, customer payment activity, and other relevant factors. Should any of these factors change, the estimate made by management may also change, which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts. We recognize an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that a receivable is not collectible and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations.\nAccrued Insurance Claims. For claims within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), workers' compensation, and employee group health. We have established reserves that we believe to be adequate based on current evaluations and our experience with these types of claims. A liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is determined with the assistance of an actuary and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as accrued insurance claims. The effect on our financial statements is generally limited to the amount needed to satisfy our insurance deductibles or retentions. The liability for total accrued insurance claims and related processing costs was $89.7 million and $87.3 million as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, respectively, and included incurred but not reported losses of approximately $44.5 million and $39.4 million, respectively. Insurance recoveries/receivables related to accrued claims as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015 was $5.7 million and $9.5 million, respectively, of which $5.7 million and $8.9 million, respectively, was included in non-current other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. As of July 25, 2015, $0.6 million of insurance recoveries/receivables was included in other current assets.\nWe estimate the liability for claims based on facts, circumstances, and historical experience. Recorded loss reserves are not discounted even though they will not be paid until sometime in the future. Factors affecting the determination of the expected cost for existing and incurred but not reported claims include, but are not limited to, the magnitude and quantity of future claims, the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations.\nWith regard to losses occurring in fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016, we retain the risk of loss of up to $1.0 million on a per-occurrence basis for automobile liability, general liability, and workers' compensation. We have maintained this same level of retention for fiscal 2017. These retention amounts are applicable to all of the states in which we operate, except with respect to workers' compensation insurance in two states in which we participate in state-sponsored insurance funds. Aggregate stop-loss coverage for automobile liability, general liability, and workers' compensation claims was $84.6 million for fiscal 2016 and is $103.7 million for fiscal 2017.\nWe are party to a stop-loss agreement for losses under our employee group health plan. For calendar years 2014 and 2015, we retained the risk of loss up to the first $250,000 of claims per participant as well as an annual aggregate amount. With regard to losses occurring in calendar year 2016, we retain the risk of loss, on an annual basis, up to the first $400,000 of claims per participant as well as an annual aggregate amount.\nStock-Based Compensation. The Company has certain stock-based compensation plans under which it grants stock-based awards, including stock options, restricted share units, and performance share units to attract, retain, and reward talented employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have granted stock-based awards under\nour 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2012 Plan\u201d), 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2003 Plan\u201d) and 2007 Non-Employee Directors Equity Plan ( 2007 Directors Plan\u201d and, together with the 2012 Plan and 2003 Plan, the Plans\u201d). Our policy is to issue new shares to satisfy equity awards under the Plans. The total number of shares available for grant under the Plans as of July 30, 2016 was 1,023,162.\nCompensation expense for stock-based awards is based on fair value at the measurement date and fluctuates over time as a result of the vesting period of the stock-based awards and our performance, as measured by criteria set forth in the performance-based awards. This expense is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and the amount of expense ultimately recognized depends on the number of awards that actually vest. For performance-based restricted share units ( Performance RSUs\u201d), we evaluate compensation expense quarterly and recognize expense for performance-based awards only if we determine it is probable that the performance measures for the awards will be met. In the event we determine it is no longer probable that we will achieve certain performance measures for the awards, the associated stock-based compensation expense that we had previously recognized is reversed in the period such a determination is made. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense may vary from fiscal year to fiscal year.\nThe fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock options generally vest ratably over a four-year period and are exercisable over a period of up to ten years. The fair value of time-based restricted share units ( RSUs\u201d) and Performance RSUs is estimated on the date of grant and is generally equal to the closing stock price on that date. RSUs and Performance RSUs are settled in one share of our common stock upon vesting. RSUs vest ratably over a period of four years. Performance RSUs vest over a period of three years from the date of grant if certain performance measures are achieved. The performance measures for target awards are based on our fiscal year operating earnings (adjusted for certain amounts) as a percentage of contract revenues and our fiscal year operating cash flow level. Additionally, certain Performance RSU awards include three-year performance measures that, if met, result in supplemental shares being awarded. The three-year performance measures required to earn supplemental awards are more difficult to achieve than those required to earn annual target awards and are based on our three-year cumulative operating earnings (adjusted for certain amounts) as a percentage of contract revenues and our three-year cumulative operating cash flow level.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate for the tax jurisdictions where we operate primarily as the result of the impact of non-deductible and non-taxable items and tax credits recognized in relation to pre-tax results. Measurement of our tax position is based on the applicable statutes, federal and state case law, and our interpretations of tax regulations. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all relevant factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, we would adjust the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC Topic 740\u201d), we recognize tax benefits in the amount that we deem more likely than not will be realized upon ultimate settlement of any tax uncertainty. Tax positions that fail to qualify for recognition are recognized in the period in which the more-likely-than-not standard has been reached, when the tax positions are resolved with the respective taxing authority or when the statute of limitations for tax examination has expired. We recognize applicable interest related to tax amounts in interest expense and penalties within general and administrative expenses.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we adopted new IRS regulations for capitalizing and deducting costs incurred to acquire, produce, or improve tangible property. The new regulations did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nContingencies and Litigation. In the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in certain legal proceedings. Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 450, Contingencies ( ASC Topic 450\u201d) requires an estimated loss from a loss contingency be accrued by a charge to operating results if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. If only a range of probable loss can be determined, we accrue for our best estimate within the range for the contingency. In those cases where none of the estimates within the range is better than another, we accrue for the amount representing the low end of the range in accordance with ASC Topic 450. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending contingencies and litigation and revise our estimates as applicable. Revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations.\nAdditionally, if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected, it would result in a charge to operating results when determined.\nBusiness Combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price of each business acquired is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on information regarding their respective fair values on the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the separately identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. We determine the fair values used in purchase price allocations for intangible assets based on historical data, estimated discounted future cash flows, contract backlog amounts, if applicable, and expected royalty rates for trademarks and trade names, as well as certain other information. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires a number of judgments and is subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available. Additional information, which existed as of the acquisition date but unknown to us at that time, may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date. Adjustments in the purchase price allocation may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill and intangible assets. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. The results of operations of businesses acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from their dates of acquisition.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. As of July 30, 2016, we had $310.2 million of goodwill, $4.7 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets and $193.2 million of finite-lived intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. As of July 25, 2015, we had $271.7 million of goodwill, $4.7 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets and $116.2 million of finite-lived intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. The increase in goodwill during fiscal 2016 is primarily the result of preliminary purchase price allocations associated with businesses acquired in fiscal 2016. The increase in net intangible assets is a result of businesses acquired during fiscal 2016, partially offset by amortization of intangibles during fiscal 2016. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe account for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC Topic 350\u201d). Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, or more frequently if events occur that would indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill at the reporting unit level. Each of our operating segments with goodwill represents a reporting unit for the purpose of assessing impairment. If we determine the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized and reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we review finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability is determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition. Should an asset not be recoverable, an impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If we determine the fair value of an asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred.\nWe use judgment in assessing whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired. Estimates of fair value are based on our projection of revenues, operating costs, and cash flows taking into consideration historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived equally from the income approach and the market approach valuation methodologies. The income approach uses the discounted cash flow method and the market approach uses the guideline company method. Changes in our judgments and projections could result in significantly different estimates of fair value, potentially resulting in impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets. The inputs used for fair value measurements of the reporting units and other related indefinite-lived intangible assets are the lowest level (Level 3) inputs.\nOur goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand and the level of overall economic activity including, in particular, construction and housing activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects during times of slowing economic conditions. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers may also cause results to vary. These factors may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the Company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units could decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.\nWe evaluate current operating results, including any losses, in the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The estimates and assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties. Changes in judgments and estimates could result in significantly different estimates of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in impairments of goodwill or intangible assets of the reporting units. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.\nWe performed our annual impairment assessment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 and concluded that no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset was indicated at any reporting unit for any of the years. Qualitative assessments on reporting units that comprise a substantial portion of our consolidated goodwill balance and on our indefinite-lived intangible asset were performed. A qualitative assessment includes evaluating all identified events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset for the purpose of determining whether it is more likely than not that these assets are impaired. We consider various factors while performing qualitative assessments, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, financial performance of the reporting units, changes in market capitalization, and any other specific reporting unit considerations. These qualitative assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value exceeded carrying value for those reporting units. For the remaining reporting units, we performed the first step of the quantitative analysis described in ASC Topic 350. Under the income approach, the key valuation assumptions used in determining the fair value estimates of our reporting units for each annual test were (a) a discount rate based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for certain risks for the reporting units; (b) terminal value based on terminal growth rates; and (c) seven expected years of cash flow before the terminal value. The table below outlines certain assumptions in each of our fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 annual quantitative impairment analyses:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminal Growth Rate Range\n</td> <td>2.0% - 3.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5% - 2.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5% - 3.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>11.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe discount rate reflects risks inherent within each reporting unit operating individually. These risks are greater than the risks inherent in the Company as a whole. The fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 analyses used the same discount rate and included consideration of market inputs such as the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, industry premium, and cost of debt, among other assumptions. The changes in these inputs from fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 had offsetting impacts and the discount rate remained at 11.5%. We believe the assumptions used in the impairment analysis each year are reflective of the risks inherent in the business models of our reporting units and within our industry. Under the market approach, the guideline company method develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies. Key valuation assumptions and valuation multiples used in determining the fair value estimates of our reporting units rely on (a) the selection of similar companies; (b) obtaining estimates of forecast revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the similar companies; and (c) selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics.\nWe determined that the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values in the fiscal 2016 annual assessment. Management determined that significant changes were not likely in the factors considered to estimate fair value, and analyzed the impact of such changes were they to occur. Specifically, if there was a 25% decrease in the fair value of any of the reporting units due to a decline in their discounted cash flows resulting from lower operating performance, the conclusion of the assessment would remain unchanged. Additionally, if the discount rate applied in the fiscal 2016 impairment analysis had been 100 basis points higher than estimated for each of the reporting units, and all other assumptions were held constant, the conclusion of the assessment would remain unchanged and there would be no impairment of goodwill. As of July 30, 2016, we believe the goodwill is recoverable for all of the reporting units; however, there can be no assurances that goodwill may not be impaired in future periods.\nCertain of our reporting units also have other intangible assets, including customer relationships, contract backlog, trade names, and non-compete intangibles. As of July 30, 2016, we believe that the carrying amounts of these intangible assets are recoverable. However, if adverse events were to occur or circumstances were to change indicating that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable, the assets would be reviewed for impairment and the assets could be impaired.\nOutlook\nSignificant developments in consumer applications continue to increase the demands for greater capacity and enhanced reliability from the wireline and wireless networks of our customers. A proliferation of technological developments has been made possible by improved networks and their underlying fiber connections. Faster broadband connections are enabling the creation of other industries in which products and services rely on robust network connections for advanced functionality. Telecommunications providers will continue to expand their network capabilities to meet the demand of their consumers, driving demand for our services as these providers outsource a significant portion of their engineering, construction, maintenance, and installation requirements.\nTelecommunications network operators are increasingly deploying fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers and businesses in order to respond to consumer demand, competitive realities, and public policy support. Fiber deployments have enabled cable companies to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services. Additionally, fiber deployments are enabling video services for local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high-speed data services. Several large telephone companies have pursued fiber-to-the-premise and fiber-to-the-node initiatives to compete actively with cable operators. Some telephone companies, which have previously deployed fiber-to-the-node architectures, have definitively transitioned to fiber-to-the-home architectures, while others are beginning to provision video over their fiber-to-the-node architectures. Further, many industry participants are deploying networks designed to provision 1-gigabit speeds to individual consumers and some have articulated plans to deploy speeds beyond 1-gigabit. Cable companies continue to increase the speeds of their services to residential customers and to deploy fiber to business customers with increasing urgency. Often these services to businesses are provided over fiber optic cables using metro Ethernet\u201d technology. The commercial geographies targeted by cable companies for network deployments generally require incremental fiber optic cable deployment and, as a result, require our services. These long-term initiatives and the possibility that other industry participants may pursue similar strategies create opportunities for us.\nWe expect the continued expansion of networks into areas of the U.S. that are currently unserved or underserved by high-speed broadband. Phase II of the Connect America Fund has been established to improve rural networks. This six-year program, administered by the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC\u201d), will provide $1.676 billion in funding per year to price cap carriers and others to expand and support broadband deployments in rural areas. In aggregate, our current customers, including several of our top ten customers, have accepted over $1.496 billion in funding per year under this program. New projects resulting from the Connect America Fund II are in planning, engineering, and construction. These projects are deploying fiber deeper into rural networks, and more are expected as new multi-year opportunities emerge. These opportunities also include fixed wireless deployments. We expect this program to contribute to demand for services in our industry.\nSignificant demand for wireless broadband is driven by the proliferation of smart phones and other mobile data devices. To respond to this demand, and other advances in technology, wireless carriers are upgrading their networks to 4G technologies and contemplating next generation mobile solutions such as small cells and 5G technologies. Wireless carriers are actively spending on their networks to respond to the explosion in wireless data traffic, to upgrade network technologies to improve performance and efficiency, and to consolidate disparate technology platforms. These initiatives present long-term opportunities for us with the wireless service providers we serve. Further, the demand for mobile broadband has increased bandwidth requirements on the wired networks of our customers. As the demand for mobile broadband grows, the amount of wireless traffic that must be backhauled\u201d over customers' fiber networks increases and, as a result, carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites and small cells. These trends are also driving the demand for our services and the increasing wireless data traffic is prompting further wireline deployments.\nSignificant consolidation and merger activity among telecommunications providers can also provide increased demand for our services as networks are integrated. As a result of recent merger activity, several of our large customers have committed to the FCC to expand and increase broadband network capabilities. These customer activities may further create a competitive response that will drive long-term demand for our services.\nOverall economic activity, including in particular construction and housing activity, also contributes to the demand for our services. Within the context of the current economy, we believe the latest trends and developments support our industry outlook. We will continue to closely monitor the effects that changes in economic and market conditions may have on our customers and our business and we will continue to manage those areas of the business we can control.\nResults of Operations\nThe results of operations of businesses acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from their dates of acquisition.

As a result, each fiscal year consists of either 52 weeks or 53 weeks of operations (with the additional week of operations occurring in the fourth quarter). Fiscal 2016 consisted of 53 weeks of operations. Fiscal 2015 and 2014 each consisted of 52 weeks of operations. Fiscal 2017 will consist of 52 weeks of operations.\nYear Ended July 30, 2016 Compared to Year Ended July 25, 2015\nRevenues. Revenues increased to $2.673 billion during fiscal 2016 from $2.022 billion during fiscal 2015. Revenues increased in the current period primarily from services for customers deploying 1-gigabit networks, new awards with significant customers, and revenues generated by businesses acquired during fiscal 2016 and 2015. Additionally, fiscal 2016 included an additional week of operations as a result of our fiscal calendar.\nDuring fiscal 2016 and 2015, total revenues of $159.0 million and $17.7 million, respectively, were generated by businesses that were not owned for the full year in both the current and prior fiscal years. Excluding these amounts, revenues increased by approximately $508.9 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Revenues increased by approximately $224.9 million for a significant telecommunications customer improving its network and by approximately $139.7 million for a large telecommunications customer primarily for increased activity for services performed under new awards. Revenues increased for a leading cable multiple system operator by approximately $102.8 million from installation, maintenance and construction services, including services to provision fiber to small and medium businesses as well as network improvements. Further, revenues increased by approximately $69.3 million for services performed for a telecommunications customer in connection with rural services. Revenues also increased for services performed on a customer's fiber network by approximately $54.5 million. Partially offsetting these increases, revenues related to stimulus work on projects funded in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 declined by $41.5 million during fiscal 2016 as the program was completed. In addition, revenues declined by $31.5 million for a customer where we were providing fiber construction on their end customer's network. All other customers, on a combined basis, had net decreases in revenues of $9.3 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.\nThe percentage of our revenue by customer type from telecommunications, underground facility locating, and electric and gas utilities and other customers, was approximately 90.7%, 5.9%, and 3.4%, respectively, for fiscal 2016, compared to 90.0%, 6.2%, and 3.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2015.\nCosts of Earned Revenues. Costs of earned revenues increased to $2.084 billion during fiscal 2016, compared to $1.593 billion during fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to a higher level of operations during fiscal 2016, including the operating costs of businesses acquired during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 as well as an additional week of operations during fiscal 2016 as a result of our fiscal calendar. The primary components of the increase were a $410.5 million aggregate increase in direct labor and subcontractor costs, $46.3 million increase in direct material costs, $13.0 million net increase in equipment rental, maintenance and fuel costs, and $20.5 million net increase in other direct costs.\nCosts of earned revenues as a percentage of contract revenue decreased 0.8% during fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015. Direct material costs and other direct costs combined decreased 2.2% of contract revenue primarily as a result of operating leverage on our increased level of operations, mix of work, and from lower fuel prices. Partially offsetting these decreases, labor and subcontractor costs increased 1.4% of contract revenue for fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in labor and subcontractor costs as a percentage of contract revenue primarily resulted from changes in work type mix and costs incurred to expand operations for several large customer programs, including the impact on productivity. Additionally, during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we experienced a more pronounced seasonal impact from the businesses acquired during calendar year 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $217.1 million, or 8.1% of contract revenue during fiscal 2016, compared to $178.7 million, or 8.8% of contract revenue, during fiscal 2015. The increase in total general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2016 primarily resulted from increased payroll and performance-based compensation costs, costs of businesses acquired in fiscal 2016 and 2015, and increased technology and facilities costs as we expanded our operations. We recognized approximately $0.7 million of acquisition costs during fiscal 2016 in connection with a business acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Additionally, stock-based compensation increased to $16.8 million during fiscal 2016, compared to $13.9 million during fiscal 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenue is due to operating leverage on our increased level of operations.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $124.9 million and $96.0 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, and totaled 4.7% of contract revenue during each fiscal year. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during fiscal 2016 is primarily a result of the addition of fixed assets during fiscal 2016 and 2015 and incremental expense of businesses acquired in fiscal 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense was $19.4 million and $16.7 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net was $34.7 million and $27.0 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense includes approximately $14.7 million for the non-cash amortization of debt discount associated with our convertible senior notes during fiscal 2016. Excluding this amortization, interest expense, net decreased to $20.0 million during fiscal 2016 primarily due to a lower interest coupon rate on the convertible senior notes issued in September 2015 compared to the previously outstanding 7.125% Notes. See Note 10, Debt, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's debt transactions.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment. In connection with the redemption of our 7.125% Notes, we incurred a pre-tax charge for early extinguishment of debt of approximately $16.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This charge is comprised of: (i) $4.9 million for the present value of the interest payments for the period from the redemption date of October 15, 2015 through January 15, 2016, (ii) $6.5 million for the excess of the present value of the redemption price over the carrying value of the 7.125% Notes, and (iii) $4.9 million for the write-off of deferred financing charges related to the fees incurred in connection with the issuance of the 7.125% Notes.\nOther Income, Net. Other income was $10.4 million and $8.3 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in other income, net is primarily a function of the number of assets sold and prices obtained for those assets during fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015. Other income, net during fiscal 2016 also includes immaterial discount fees related to a customer-sponsored vendor payment program in which we participate. Under this program, accounts receivable are collected on an expedited basis pursuant to a non-recourse sale of the receivables to a bank partner of the customer. The program significantly reduces the time required to collect that customer's receivables.\nIncome Taxes. The following table presents our income tax provision and effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFluctuations in our effective income tax rate were primarily attributable to the difference in income tax rates from state to state, non-deductible and non-taxable items, disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock option exercises, and production-related tax deductions recognized in relation to our pre-tax results during the periods. The decrease in our effective income tax rate during the current year period, as compared to the prior year period, is primarily due to increased production-related tax deductions recognized in relation to higher pre-tax results in the current period and a lesser impact of non-deductible items. We had total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $2.4 million and $2.3 million as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, respectively, which, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.\nNet Income. Net income was $128.7 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $84.3 million for fiscal 2015.\nYear Ended July 25, 2015 Compared to Year Ended July 26, 2014\nRevenues. Revenues increased to $2.022 billion during fiscal 2015 from $1.812 billion during fiscal 2014. Revenues increased in fiscal 2015 from services for customers deploying 1-gigabit networks and from new awards with significant customers. Additionally, work performed during fiscal 2015 was significantly less impacted by weather conditions as compared to fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2015, total revenues of $40.4 million were generated by businesses acquired during fiscal 2015 as well as during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014, total revenues of $2.8 million were generated by businesses acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Excluding amounts from these businesses that were not owned for the full year in both fiscal years, revenues increased by approximately $173.1 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Revenues increased for a significant customer investing in improvements to its networks by approximately $56.3 million. Revenues also increased for services performed on a customer's fiber network by approximately $55.1 million. In addition, revenues increased for a leading cable multiple system operator by approximately $48.2 million from maintenance and construction services, including services to provision fiber to small and medium businesses as well as network improvements. Other increases in revenue include increases of approximately $39.9 million for a customer for which we are performing fiber construction services on their end customer's network and increases of approximately $24.0 million for a large telecommunications customer investing in improvements to its network. Partially offsetting these increases, revenues related to stimulus work on projects funded in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 declined by approximately $61.4 million during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014, as the program was completed. Furthermore, revenues for a cable multiple system operator declined $17.9 million. All other customers, on a combined basis, had net increases in revenues of $28.9 million during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014.\nThe percentage of our revenue by customer type from telecommunications, underground facility locating, and electric and gas utilities and other customers, was approximately 90.0%, 6.2%, and 3.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2015, compared to 88.2%, 7.0% and 4.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2014.\nCosts of Earned Revenues. Costs of earned revenues increased to $1.593 billion during fiscal 2015, compared to $1.475 billion during fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to a higher level of operations during fiscal 2015, including the operating costs of businesses acquired during fiscal 2015 and 2014. The primary components of the increase were a $102.4 million aggregate increase in direct labor and subcontractor costs, $16.1 million increase in direct material costs, and $8.8 million increase in other direct costs, including insurance claim expense. These increases were partially offset by a $9.1 million aggregate decrease from lower fuel consumption and lower fuel prices during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014.\nCosts of earned revenues as a percentage of contract revenue decreased 2.6% during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was partially due to higher productivity resulting from the mix of work performed and better weather conditions during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2015, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2014. Adverse weather conditions during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2014 negatively impacted productivity and margins during those periods. Labor and subcontractor costs represented a lower percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2015 and decreased 1.0% as a percentage of\ncontract revenue, compared to fiscal 2014, as a result of improved operating efficiency based on the mix of work performed. In addition, costs decreased 0.7% from lower fuel consumption and lower fuel prices. Direct material costs decreased 0.2% as a percentage of contract revenue and other direct costs decreased 0.7% as a percentage of contract revenue, compared to fiscal 2014, as a result of improved operating leverage on our increased level of operations.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $178.7 million, or 8.8% as a percentage of contract revenue, during fiscal 2015, compared to $161.9 million, or 8.9% as a percentage of contract revenue, during fiscal 2014. The increase in total general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2015 resulted from increased payroll and performance-based compensation costs, higher legal and other professional fees, and the costs of businesses acquired in fiscal 2015 and 2014. Additionally, stock-based compensation increased to $13.9 million during fiscal 2015, from $12.6 million during fiscal 2014. Stock-based compensation recognized in fiscal 2014 for Performance RSUs was lower than fiscal 2015 because the Company did not fully achieve the performance goals set forth for the fiscal 2014 performance period.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased to $96.0 million during fiscal 2015, from $92.8 million during fiscal 2014, and totaled 4.7% and 5.1% of contract revenue, respectively. The increase in depreciation expense, arising from the addition of fixed assets during fiscal 2015 and depreciation from businesses acquired in fiscal 2015 and 2014, was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense. Amortization expense decreased to $16.7 million during fiscal 2015 from $18.3 million during fiscal 2014. The decrease in amortization expense was a result of certain contract backlog intangible assets of the telecommunications infrastructure services subsidiaries acquired from Quanta Services, Inc. becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net was $27.0 million and $26.8 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase for fiscal 2015 reflects higher debt balances outstanding for a longer time period during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The additional cost on incremental debt was partially offset by lower interest rates on the outstanding balances as a result of the amendment of our credit agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net was $8.3 million and $11.2 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in other income was primarily a function of the number of assets sold and prices obtained for those assets during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014.\nIncome Taxes. The following table presents our income tax provision and effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>37.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFluctuations in our effective income tax rate were primarily attributable to the difference in income tax rates from state to state, non-deductible and non-taxable items, disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock option exercises, and a production-related tax deduction recognized in relation to our pre-tax results during the period. Non-deductible and non-taxable items will generally have a reduced impact on the effective income tax rate in periods of increased pre-tax results. We had total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $2.3 million and $2.4 million as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014, respectively, that, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.\nNet Income. Net income was $84.3 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $40.0 million for fiscal 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe are subject to concentrations of credit risk relating primarily to our cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. Cash and equivalents primarily include balances on deposit with banks and totaled $33.8 million as of July 30, 2016, compared to $21.3 million as of July 25, 2015. We maintain our cash and equivalents at financial institutions we believe to be of high credit quality. To date, we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 0.75% convertible senior notes due September 2021, we entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain counterparties. We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to these convertible note hedge transactions. The hedge counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that\nthey might default under the convertible note hedge transactions. To mitigate that risk, we contracted with institutional counterparties who met specific requirements under our risk assessment process. Additionally, the transactions are subject to a netting arrangement, which also reduces credit risk.\nSources of Cash. Our sources of cash have been operating activities, long-term debt, equity offerings, stock option proceeds, bank borrowings, and proceeds from the sale of idle and surplus equipment and real property. Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services and operating margins, but can also be influenced by working capital needs associated with the services that we provide. In particular, working capital needs may increase when we have growth in operations and where project costs, primarily associated with labor, equipment, materials, and subcontractors, are required to be paid before the related customer balances owed to us are invoiced and collected. Our working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities, excluding the current portion of debt) was $541.7 million as of July 30, 2016, compared to $473.7 million as of July 25, 2015.\nCapital resources are used primarily to purchase equipment and maintain sufficient levels of working capital to support our contractual commitments to customers. We periodically borrow from and repay our revolving credit facility depending on our cash requirements. We currently intend to retain any earnings for use in the business, including for investment in acquisitions, and consequently we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe expect capital expenditures, net of disposals, to range from $175.0 million to $185.0 million for fiscal 2017 to support growth opportunities and the replacement of certain fleet assets. Our level of capital expenditures can vary depending on the customer demand for our services, the replacement cycle we select for our equipment, and overall growth. We intend to fund these expenditures primarily from operating cash flows, availability under our credit agreement and cash on hand.\nSufficiency of Capital Resources. We believe that our capital resources, including existing cash balances and amounts available under our credit agreement, are sufficient to meet our financial obligations. These obligations include interest payments required on our convertible senior notes and outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement, working capital requirements, and the normal replacement of equipment at our current level of operations for at least the next twelve months. Our capital requirements may increase to the extent we seek to grow by acquisitions that involve consideration other than our stock, or to the extent we repurchase our common stock, repay credit agreement borrowings, or repurchase or convert our convertible senior notes. Changes in financial markets or other components of the economy could adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets, in which case we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our credit agreement to provide short-term funding. Management regularly monitors the financial markets and assesses general economic conditions for possible impact on our financial position. We believe our cash investment policies are prudent and expect that any volatility in the capital markets would not have a material impact on our cash investments.\nNet cash flows. The following table presents our net cash flows for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>261.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(333.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(130.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(91.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Provided by Operating Activities. During fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $261.5 million. Non-cash items in the cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 were primarily depreciation and amortization, gain on sale of assets, bad debt expense, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount, non-cash loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of debt issuance costs, and deferred income taxes. Changes in working capital (excluding cash) and changes in other long-term assets and liabilities used $33.8 million of operating cash flow during fiscal 2016. Working capital changes that used operating cash flow during fiscal 2016 included an increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $71.0 million. In addition, net increases in other current assets and other non-current assets combined used $16.7 million of operating cash flow during fiscal 2016 primarily for inventory and prepaid costs. Working capital changes that provided operating cash flow during fiscal 2016, primarily resulting from the timing of payments, were net increases in income taxes payable of $20.1 million, accrued liabilities of $15.9 million, primarily resulting from an increase in accrued performance-based compensation as a result of operating performance, and accounts payable of $15.1 million. Additionally, a decrease in accounts receivable provided $2.7 million of operating cash flow during fiscal 2016.\nOur days sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d) for accounts receivable is calculated based on the ending accounts receivable divided by the average daily revenue for the most recently completed quarter. Contract payment terms vary by customer and primarily range from 30 to 90 days after invoicing. Our DSO was 41 days as of July 30, 2016, compared to 50 days as of July 25, 2015. Our DSO declined due to strong customer collections during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we began participating in a customer-sponsored vendor payment program whereby accounts receivable are collected on an expedited basis pursuant to a non-recourse sale of the receivables to a bank partner of the customer. The program significantly reduces the time required to collect that customer's receivables. We incur a slight discount fee associated with the collection of the accounts receivable that is reflected as an expense component in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold $85.6 million of receivables under this program to the customer's bank in advance of the original contract payment terms, improving the time required to collect the related receivables by 10 days as of July 30, 2016. We believe the DSO level for accounts receivable as of July 30, 2016 can be sustained so long as we continue on with the program. Our DSO for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings ( CIEB\u201d) was 44 days and 41 days as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, respectively.\nOur CIEB balances are maintained at a detailed task-specific level or project level and are evaluated regularly for realizability. Such amounts are invoiced in the normal course of business according to contract terms that consider the completion of specific tasks and the passage of time. Project delays for commercial issues such as permitting, engineering changes, incremental documentation requirements, or difficult job site conditions can extend the time needed to complete certain work orders, which may delay invoicing to the customer for work performed. We were not experiencing any material project delays or other circumstances that would impact the realizability of the CIEB balance as of July 30, 2016. Additionally, there were no material amounts of CIEB related to claims or unapproved change orders as of July 30, 2016 or July 25, 2015. As of July 30, 2016, we believe that none of our significant customers were experiencing financial difficulties that would impact the realizability of our CIEB or the collectability of our trade accounts receivable.\nDuring fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $141.9 million. Changes in working capital (excluding cash) and changes in other long-term assets and liabilities used $40.3 million of operating cash flow during fiscal 2015. Working capital changes that used operating cash flow during fiscal 2015 were increases in accounts receivable and net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $40.4 million and $41.0 million, respectively. Net increases in other current and other non-current assets combined used $8.0 million of operating cash flow during fiscal 2015, primarily for pre-paid costs during fiscal 2015. The primary working capital sources of cash flow during fiscal 2015 were changes in other accrued liabilities of $30.3 million, primarily resulting from an increase in accrued insurance claims and an increase in accrued performance-based compensation as a result of operating performance. In addition, increases in accounts payable of $7.1 million and increases in income tax payable, net of income tax receivables, of $11.8 million provided operating cash flow during fiscal 2015 due to the timing of cash payments.\nOur DSO for accounts receivable (based on the ending accounts receivable divided by the average daily revenue for the most recently completed quarter) was 50 days as of July 25, 2015, compared to 51 days as of July 26, 2014. Contract payment terms vary by customer and primarily range from 30 to 60 days after invoicing. Our DSO for CIEB was 41 days as of both July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014. During fiscal 2015, we collected certain of the past due balances from a customer on a rural project funded in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the ARRA\u201d). As of July 25, 2015, approximately, $6.8 million was owed to us by this customer, the entirety of which was collected during fiscal 2016.\nDuring fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $84.2 million. Changes in working capital (excluding cash) and changes in other long-term assets and liabilities used $43.3 million of operating cash flow during fiscal 2014. The primary working capital changes that used operating cash flow during fiscal 2014 were increases in accounts receivable and net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $16.9 million and $25.4 million, respectively, as a result of an increase in the level of our operations, including growth with certain customers, and slightly longer collection times during fiscal 2014. Net increases in other current and other non-current assets combined used $13.4 million of operating cash flow during fiscal 2014 primarily for inventory. Additionally, decreases in accounts payable used $4.2 million of operating cash flow as a result of timing of payments. Working capital sources of cash flow during fiscal 2014 were increases in accrued liabilities, insurance claims, and other liabilities of $10.0 million primarily due to timing of insurance claims related payments and increases in income tax payable, net of income tax receivables, of $6.7 million due to the timing of payments.\nCash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $333.1 million during fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we paid $157.2 million in connection with acquisitions during the year. Capital expenditures of $186.0 million were offset in part by proceeds from the sale of assets of $10.5 million during fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of spending for new work opportunities and the replacement of certain fleet assets. Restricted cash, primarily related to funding provisions of our insurance program, increased approximately $0.5 million during fiscal 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $130.1 million during fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2015, we paid $31.9 million in connection with acquisitions during the year. Capital expenditures of $103.0 million were offset in part by proceeds from the sale of assets of $9.4 million during fiscal 2015. Additionally, during fiscal 2015, we made an investment of $4.0 million in non-voting senior units of a former customer in connection with their restructuring plan. Restricted cash, primarily related to funding provisions of our insurance program, increased approximately $0.5 million during fiscal 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $91.1 million during fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014, we paid $17.1 million in connection with acquisitions during the year. Capital expenditures of $89.1 million were offset in part by proceeds from the sale of assets of $15.4 million during fiscal 2014. Restricted cash, primarily related to funding provisions of our insurance program, increased approximately $0.3 million during fiscal 2014.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $84.1 million during fiscal 2016. The primary source of cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2016 was the $485.0 million principal amount of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2021 (the Notes\u201d) issued in a private placement in September 2015. We used $277.5 million of the net proceeds from the Notes issuance to fund the redemption of our 7.125% senior subordinated notes. Furthermore, in connection with the offering of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with counterparties for a total cost of approximately $115.8 million. We also entered into separately negotiated warrant transactions with the same counterparties, and received proceeds of approximately $74.7 million from the sale of these warrants. See Note 10, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of these debt transactions. During fiscal 2016, net repayments on the revolving facility under our credit agreement were $95.3 million and net borrowings on the term loan facilities under our credit agreement were $196.3 million. Additionally, we paid approximately $16.4 million in total debt issuance costs in connection with the amendments of our credit agreement and our issuance of the Notes during fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased 2,511,578 shares of our common stock in open market transactions, at an average price of $67.69 per share, for approximately $170.0 million. In addition, during fiscal 2016 we received $2.7 million from the exercise of stock options and received excess tax benefits of $13.0 million, primarily from the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted share units. We withheld shares and paid $12.6 million to tax authorities in order to meet the payroll tax withholding obligations on restricted share units that vested during fiscal 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $11.2 million during fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2015, borrowings under our credit agreement, net of repayments, were $68.2 million. Additionally, in fiscal 2015, we paid $3.9 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the amendment of our credit agreement. We also paid a $1.0 million obligation related to a business acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 1,669,924 shares of our common stock in open market transactions for approximately $87.1 million, an average price of $52.19 per share. Additionally, we received $8.9 million from the exercise of stock options and received excess tax benefits of $8.4 million primarily from the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted share units during fiscal 2015. We withheld shares and paid $4.7 million to tax authorities in order to meet payroll tax withholdings obligations on restricted share units that vested during fiscal 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $9.0 million during fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014, we received $14.6 million from the exercise of stock options and $3.0 million of excess tax benefits primarily from the exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted share units during fiscal 2014. Additionally, net revolving borrowings under our credit agreement were $14.0 million, partially offset by principal payments on the term loan under our credit agreement of $7.8 million. Additionally, we paid a $1.0 million obligation related to a business acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased 360,900 shares of our common stock in open market transactions, at an average price of $27.71 per share, for approximately $10.0 million. We withheld shares and paid $3.8 million to tax authorities in order to meet payroll tax withholdings obligations on restricted share units that vested during fiscal 2014.\nCompliance with Credit Agreement and Indenture. We are party to a credit agreement with the various lenders named therein, dated as of December 3, 2012 (as amended as of June 17, 2016, May 20, 2016, April 24, 2015 and September 9, 2015), that matures on April 24, 2020. The credit agreement provides for a $450.0 million revolving facility, $350.0 million in aggregate term loan facilities, and contains a sublimit of $200.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. Subject to certain conditions, the credit agreement provides us with the ability to enter into one or more incremental facilities, either by increasing the revolving commitments under the credit agreement and/or in the form of term loans, up to the greater of (i) $150.0 million and (ii) an amount such that, after giving effect to such incremental facility on a pro forma basis (assuming that the amount of the incremental commitments are fully drawn and funded), the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio does not exceed 2.25 to 1.00. The consolidated senior secured leverage ratio is the ratio of our consolidated senior secured indebtedness to our trailing twelve-month consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), as defined by the credit agreement. The incremental facilities can be in the form of revolving commitments under the credit agreement and/or in the form of term loans. Payments under the credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries and secured by the equity interests of the substantial majority of our subsidiaries.\nBorrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at rates described below based upon our consolidated leverage ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated total funded debt to our trailing twelve month consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit agreement. In addition, we incur certain fees for unused balances and letters of credit at rates described below, also based upon our consolidated leverage ratio:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings - Eurodollar Rate Loans\n</td> <td>1.25% - 2.00% plus LIBOR\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings - Base Rate Loans\n</td> <td>0.25% - 1.00% plus administrative agent's base rate(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused Revolver Commitment\n</td> <td>0.25% - 0.40%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby Letters of Credit\n</td> <td>1.25% - 2.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Letters of Credit\n</td> <td>0.625% - 1.00%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The agent's base rate is described in the credit agreement as the highest of (i) the administrative agent's prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) the Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin.\nThe weighted average interest rates and fees for balances under the credit agreement as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015 were as follows:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Rate End of Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>July 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 25, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings - Term loan facilities\n</td> <td>2.49%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.94%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings - Revolving facility(1)\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.02%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby Letters of Credit\n</td> <td>2.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.75%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused Revolver\n</td> <td>0.40%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.35%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility as of July 30, 2016.\nThe credit agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00, as measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. It provides for certain increases to this ratio in connection with permitted acquisitions on the terms and conditions specified in the credit agreement. In addition, the credit agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio, which is the ratio of our trailing twelve-month consolidated EBITDA to our consolidated interest expense, as defined by the credit agreement, of not less than 3.00 to 1.00, as measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. At July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of our credit agreement and had additional borrowing availability in the revolving facility of $392.4 million and $300.3 million, respectively, as determined by the most restrictive covenants.\nContractual Obligations. The following table sets forth our outstanding contractual obligations as of July 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 1 - 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 3 - 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Greater than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.75% convertible senior notes due September 2021\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit agreement - revolving borrowings\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit agreement - term loan facilities\n</td> <td>13,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>285,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed interest payments on long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>3,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>19,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employment agreements\n</td> <td>12,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase and other contractual obligations(2)\n</td> <td>23,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>491,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>961,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes interest payments on our $485.0 million principal amount of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2021 outstanding and excludes any interest payments on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of July 30, 2016 consisted of $346.3 million outstanding under our term loan facilities.\n(2) Purchase and other contractual obligations primarily represent obligations under agreements to purchase vehicles and equipment that have not been received as of July 30, 2016. We have excluded contractual obligations under the multi-employer defined pension plans that cover certain of our employees, as these obligations are determined based on our future union employee payrolls, which cannot be reliably determined as of July 30, 2016.\nOur consolidated balance sheet as of July 30, 2016 includes a long-term liability of approximately $52.8 million for accrued insurance claims. This liability has been excluded from the above table as the timing of payments is uncertain.\nThe liability for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions was $2.4 million and $2.3 million as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, respectively, and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. This amount has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions with the relevant tax authorities.\nPerformance Bonds and Guarantees - We have obligations under performance and other surety contract bonds related to certain of our customer contracts. Performance bonds generally provide a customer with the right to obtain payment and/or performance from the issuer of the bond if we fail to perform our contractual obligations. As of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, we had $165.8 million and $294.9 million of outstanding performance and other surety contract bonds, respectively. The estimated cost to complete projects secured by our outstanding performance and other surety contract bonds was approximately $45.8 million as of July 30, 2016. Additionally, we have periodically guaranteed certain obligations of our subsidiaries, including obligations in connection with obtaining state contractor licenses and leasing real property and equipment.\nLetters of Credit - We have standby letters of credit issued under our credit agreement as part of our insurance program. These letters of credit collateralize our obligations to our insurance carriers in connection with the settlement of potential claims. As of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, we had $57.6 million and $54.4 million, respectively, outstanding standby letters of credit issued under our credit agreement.\nBacklog. Our backlog consists of the estimated uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contractual agreements with our customers and totaled $6.031 billion and $3.680 billion at July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, respectively. The increase in backlog primarily relates to new awards. We expect to complete 38.5% of the July 30, 2016 backlog during the next twelve months. Our backlog estimates represent amounts under master service agreements and other contractual agreements for services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts and are based on contract terms, our historical experience with customers and, more generally, our experience in similar procurements. The significant majority of our backlog estimates comprise services under master service agreements and long-term contracts.\nRevenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change because of project accelerations, contract cancellations, or delays due to various factors, including, but not limited to, commercial issues such as permitting, engineering changes, incremental documentation requirements, difficult job site conditions, and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue to be realized in different periods or in different amounts from those originally reflected in backlog. In many\ninstances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract. While we did not experience any material cancellations during fiscal 2016, 2015, or 2014, many of our customers may cancel our contracts upon notice regardless of whether or not we are in default. The amount of backlog related to uncompleted projects in which a provision for estimated losses was recorded is not material.\nBacklog is not a measure defined by United States generally accepted accounting principles; however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn May 2013, CertusView Technologies, LLC ( CertusView\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, filed suit against S & N Communications, Inc. and S&N Locating Services, LLC (together, S&N\u201d) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging infringement of certain United States patents. In January 2015, the District Court granted S&N's motion for judgment on the pleadings for failure to claim patent-eligible subject matter, and entered final judgment on those claims the same day. CertusView filed a Notice of Appeal in February 2015 with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In May 2015, the District Court reopened the case to allow S&N to proceed with inequitable conduct counterclaims. In July 2015, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal in that court pending resolution of proceedings in the District Court. A bench trial in the District Court on the inequitable conduct counterclaims whereby S&N was seeking additional grounds to find the patents unenforceable took place in March 2016 and post-trial briefs were filed with the District Court in April 2016. In August 2016, the District Court ruled against S&N and in favor of CertusView on the inequitable conduct counterclaims and entered final judgment. Subsequent to the judgment being entered, on August 24, 2016, S&N filed a motion requesting the District Court make a finding that the suit was an exceptional case and award S&N recovery of its attorney fees. It is too early to evaluate the likelihood of an outcome to this motion and CertusView intends to vigorously defend itself.\nFrom time to time, we are party to various other claims and legal proceedings. It is the opinion of management, based on information available at this time, that such other pending claims or proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1, Accounting Policies, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements.", "summary": "- This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, as well as Part I, Item 1, Business, and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n- We are a leading provider of specialty contracting services throughout the United States and in Canada.\n- Our subsidiary companies provide program management, engineering, construction, maintenance, and installation services for telecommunications providers, underground facility locating services for various utilities, including telecommunications providers, and other construction and maintenance services for electric and gas utilities.\n- We provide the labor, tools and equipment necessary to design, engineer, locate, maintain, expand, install and upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure of our customers.\n- Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers in each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 accounting for approximately 69.7%, 61.1% and 58.3% of our total revenues, respectively.\n- We generally possess multiple agreements with each of our significant customers.", "item_7_tables": "Table 24: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AT&T Inc.\n</td> <td>24.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CenturyLink, Inc.\n</td> <td>14.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comcast Corporation\n</td> <td>13.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Verizon Communications Inc.\n</td> <td>11.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charter Communications, Inc.(1)\n</td> <td>6.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Windstream Corporation\n</td> <td>5.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 25: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminal Growth Rate Range\n</td> <td>2.0% -

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, as well as Part I, Item 1, Business, and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntroduction\nWe are a leading provider of specialty contracting services throughout the United States and in Canada. Our subsidiary companies provide program management, engineering, construction, maintenance, and installation services for telecommunications providers, underground facility locating services for various utilities, including telecommunications providers, and other construction and maintenance services for electric and gas utilities. We provide the labor, tools and equipment necessary to design, engineer, locate, maintain, expand, install and upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure of our customers.\nSignificant developments in consumer applications within the telecommunications industry, including advanced digital and video service offerings, continue to increase the demand for greater capacity and enhanced reliability from our customers' wireline and wireless networks. Telecommunications providers outsource a significant portion of their engineering, construction, maintenance, and installation requirements, driving demand for our services.\nTelecommunications network operators are increasingly deploying fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers and businesses in order to respond to consumer demand, competitive realities, and public policy support. Several large telephone companies have pursued fiber-to-the-premise and fiber-to-the-node initiatives to compete actively with cable operators. Some telephone companies, which have previously deployed fiber-to-the-node architectures, have definitively transitioned to fiber-to-the-home architectures, while others are beginning to provision video over their fiber-to-the-node architectures. Cable companies continue to increase the speeds of their services to residential customers and to deploy fiber to business customers with increasing urgency. Many industry participants are deploying networks designed to provision 1 gigabit speeds to individual consumers and some have articulated plans to deploy speeds beyond 1-gigabit.\nOpportunities exist to improve rural networks as a result of Phase II of the Connect America Fund. This six-year program, administered by the Federal Communications Commission, will provide $1.676 billion in funding per year to price cap carriers and others to expand and support broadband deployments in rural areas. In aggregate, our current customers, including several of our top ten customers, have accepted over $1.496 billion in funding per year under this program. New projects resulting from the Connect America Fund Phase II are in planning, engineering, and construction. These projects are deploying fiber deeper into rural networks, and more are expected as new multi-year opportunities emerge. These opportunities also include fixed wireless deployments. We expect this program to contribute to demand for services in our industry.\nSignificant demand for wireless broadband is driven by the proliferation of smart phones and other mobile data devices. Wireless carriers are actively spending on their networks to respond to the significant increase in wireless data traffic, to upgrade network technologies to improve performance and efficiency, and to consolidate disparate technology platforms. As the demand for mobile broadband grows, the amount of wireless traffic that must be backhauled\u201d over customers' fiber networks increases and, as a result, carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites and small cells. These trends are driving demand for our services and the increasing wireless data traffic is prompting further wireline deployments.\nThe cyclical nature of the industry we serve may affect demand for our services. The capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers, and the related timing of approvals and seasonal spending patterns, influence our revenues and results of operations. The business demands of our customers and the demands of their consumers, the introduction of new communication technologies, the physical maintenance needs of customer infrastructure, the actions of our government and the FCC, and overall economic conditions may affect the capital expenditures and maintenance budgets of our telecommunications\ncustomers. Changes in our mix of customers, contracts, and business activities, as well as changes in the general level of construction activity also drive variations in revenues and results of operations.\nCustomer Relationships and Contractual Arrangements\nWe have established relationships with many leading telecommunications providers, including telephone companies, cable television multiple system operators, wireless carriers, telecommunication equipment and infrastructure providers, and electric and gas utilities. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers in each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 accounting for approximately 69.7%, 61.1% and 58.3% of our total revenues, respectively. The following reflects the percentage of total revenue from customers who contributed at least 2.5% to our total revenue during fiscal 2016, 2015, or 2014:\n\n(1) For comparison purposes in the above table, revenues from Charter Communications, Inc., Time Warner Cable Inc., and Bright House Networks, LLC have been combined for periods prior to their May 2016 merger.\nIn addition, another customer contributed 6.2%, 5.6%, and 3.2% to our total revenue during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nWe generally possess multiple agreements with each of our significant customers. To the extent that such agreements specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the customer's ability to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, the performance of work with the customer's own employees, and the use of other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility. In most cases, a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience with written notice. Historically, multi-year master service agreements have been awarded primarily through a competitive bidding process, however, we occasionally are able to extend these agreements through negotiations. Revenues from multi-year master service agreements were approximately 61.4% during fiscal 2016, and 65.2% during each of fiscal 2015 and 2014.\nWe provide the remainder of our services pursuant to contracts for specific projects. These contracts may be long-term (with terms greater than one year) or short-term (with terms generally three to four months in duration) and often include customary retainage provisions under which the customer may withhold 5% to 10% of the invoiced amounts pending project completion. Revenues from long-term contracts for specific projects were 19.6%, 14.7%, and 13.7%, as a percentage of total contract revenues during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. We regularly review opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify, acquire, and successfully integrate companies.\nFiscal 2016 - During August 2015, we acquired TelCom Construction, Inc. and an affiliate (together, TelCom\u201d). The purchase price was $48.8 million paid in cash. TelCom, based in Clearwater, Minnesota, provides construction and maintenance services for telecommunications providers throughout the United States. This acquisition expands our geographical presence within our existing customer base. During July 2016, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with the wireless network deployment and wireline operations of Goodman Networks Incorporated ( Goodman\u201d) for a cash purchase price of $107.5 million, subject to working capital adjustments. The total cash transaction consideration paid was $102.8 million after a preliminary working capital adjustment of $4.7 million. The acquired operations\nprovide wireless construction services in a number of markets, including Texas, Georgia, and Southern California. The acquisition reinforces our wireless construction resources and expands our geographical presence within our existing customer base. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we acquired NextGen Telecom Services Group, Inc. ( NextGen\u201d) for $5.6 million, net of cash acquired. NextGen provides construction and maintenance services for telecommunications providers in the Northeastern United States.\nWith respect to the Goodman acquisition, $22.5 million of the purchase price was placed into an escrow account, $2.5 million of which is available for working capital adjustments and $20.0 million of which is available to us for indemnification obligations of the seller. Of the $20.0 million available for indemnification obligations, $10.0 million will be released to the seller upon the occurrence of certain conditions, but in no event earlier than the twelve-month anniversary of the closing date. The remaining $10.0 million will be released to the seller when the seller satisfies certain conditions with respect to a dispute with the state of Texas over a sales tax liability of approximately $31.7 million (the Sales Tax Liability\u201d). Under the purchase agreement, Goodman has retained responsibility for this Sales Tax Liability. Should Goodman not resolve this matter, the state may assert that we are a successor to the operations and seek to recover from us. In such event we would seek indemnification for recovery from Goodman, including from the funds contained in the escrow account, for any amount we pay.\nFiscal 2015 - During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we acquired Hewitt Power & Communications, Inc. ( Hewitt\u201d) for $8.0 million, net of cash acquired. Hewitt provides specialty contracting services primarily for telecommunications providers in the Southeastern United States. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we acquired the assets of two cable installation contractors for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we acquired Moll's Utility Services, LLC ( Moll's\u201d) for $6.5 million, net of cash acquired. Moll's provides specialty contracting services primarily for utilities in the Midwest United States. We also acquired the assets of Venture Communications Group, LLC ( Venture\u201d) for $15.6 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Venture provides specialty contracting services primarily for telecommunications providers in the Midwest and Southeastern United States.\nFiscal 2014 - During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired a telecommunications specialty construction contractor in Canada for $0.7 million. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired Watts Brothers Cable Construction, Inc. ( Watts Brothers\u201d) for $16.4 million. Watts Brothers provides specialty contracting services primarily for telecommunications providers in the Midwest and Southeastern United States.\nUnderstanding Our Results of Operations\nThe following information is presented in order for the reader to better understand certain factors impacting our results of operations and profitability, and should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below as well as Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues. We perform a majority of our services under master service agreements and other agreements that contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discrete pricing for individual tasks. Revenue is recognized under these arrangements based on units-of-delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed. The remainder of our services are performed under contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting as more fully described within Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below.\nCost of Earned Revenues. Cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts, including costs for direct labor provided by employees, services by independent subcontractors, operation of capital equipment (excluding depreciation), direct materials, insurance costs, and other direct costs. For claims within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), workers' compensation, and employee group health.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses, including performance-based compensation and stock-based compensation, legal, consulting and professional fees, information technology and development costs, provision for or recoveries of bad debt expense, acquisition and integration costs of businesses acquired, and other costs not directly related to the provision of our services under customer contracts. We incur information technology and development costs primarily to support and enhance our operating efficiency. To protect our rights, we have filed for patents on certain of our innovations. Our executive management team and the senior management of our subsidiaries perform substantially all of our sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Our property and equipment primarily consist of vehicles, equipment and machinery, and computer hardware and software. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. In addition, we have intangible assets, including customer relationships, contract backlog, trade names, and non-compete intangibles, which we amortize over the estimated useful lives. We recognize amortization of customer relationship intangibles and acquired contract backlog intangibles on an accelerated basis as a function of the expected economic benefit. We recognize amortization of our other finite-lived intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment. Loss on debt extinguishment for fiscal 2016 includes pre-tax charges related to the redemption of our 7.125% senior subordinated notes (the 7.125% Notes\u201d), including the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs on the 7.125% Notes.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, consists of interest incurred on outstanding variable rate and fixed rate debt and certain other obligations. Interest expense also includes non-cash amortization of our convertible senior notes debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs. See Note 10, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the non-cash amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net, primarily consists of gains or losses from sales of fixed assets. Other income, net during fiscal 2016 also includes immaterial discount fees related to a customer-sponsored vendor payment program in which we participate. Under this program, accounts receivable are collected on an expedited basis pursuant to a non-recourse sale of the receivables to a bank partner of the customer. The program significantly reduces the time required to collect that customer's receivables.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations. Our revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, extended periods of adverse weather, which are more likely to occur during the winter season, impact our operations during our second and third fiscal quarters. In addition, a disproportionate percentage of paid holidays fall within our second fiscal quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Because of these factors, we are most likely to experience reduced revenue and profitability during our second and third fiscal quarters.\nWe experience quarterly variations in revenues and results of operations as a result of other factors as well. Such factors include fluctuations in insurance expense due to changes in claims experience and actuarial assumptions, variances in incentive pay and stock-based compensation expense as a result of operating performance and vesting provisions, and changes in the employer portion of payroll taxes, including unemployment taxes, as a result of reaching statutory limits. Other factors that may contribute to quarterly variations in results of operations include other income recognized as a result of the timing and levels of capital assets sold during the period, income tax expense attributable to levels of taxable earnings, and the impact of disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock option expenses.\nAccordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal period.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions require the use of judgment as to the likelihood of various future outcomes and, as a result, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nWe have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The impact of these policies affects our reported and expected financial results. We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies herein.\nOther significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below, are also important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion.\nRevenue Recognition. We perform a majority of our services under master service agreements and other agreements that contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discrete pricing for individual tasks. We recognize revenue under these arrangements based on units-of-delivery as each unit is completed. The remainder of our services, representing less than 5% of our contract revenues during fiscal 2016 and less than 10% of our contract revenues during each of fiscal 2015 and 2014, are performed under contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting. Revenue is recognized under these arrangements based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. For contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of completion, we accrue the entire amount of a contract loss at the time the loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. During each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, there was no material impact to our results of operations due to changes in contract estimates.\nThere were no material amounts of unapproved change orders or claims recognized during each of fiscal 2016, 2015, or 2014. The current asset Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The current liability Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on uncollected balances. Management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable balances each period. This analysis considers the aging of account balances, historical bad debt experience, changes in customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, customer payment activity, and other relevant factors. Should any of these factors change, the estimate made by management may also change, which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts. We recognize an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that a receivable is not collectible and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations.\nAccrued Insurance Claims. For claims within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), workers' compensation, and employee group health. We have established reserves that we believe to be adequate based on current evaluations and our experience with these types of claims. A liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is determined with the assistance of an actuary and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as accrued insurance claims. The effect on our financial statements is generally limited to the amount needed to satisfy our insurance deductibles or retentions. The liability for total accrued insurance claims and related processing costs was $89.7 million and $87.3 million as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, respectively, and included incurred but not reported losses of approximately $44.5 million and $39.4 million, respectively. Insurance recoveries/receivables related to accrued claims as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015 was $5.7 million and $9.5 million, respectively, of which $5.7 million and $8.9 million, respectively, was included in non-current other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. As of July 25, 2015, $0.6 million of insurance recoveries/receivables was included in other current assets.\nWe estimate the liability for claims based on facts, circumstances, and historical experience. Recorded loss reserves are not discounted even though they will not be paid until sometime in the future. Factors affecting the determination of the expected cost for existing and incurred but not reported claims include, but are not limited to, the magnitude and quantity of future claims, the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations.\nWith regard to losses occurring in fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016, we retain the risk of loss of up to $1.0 million on a per-occurrence basis for automobile liability, general liability, and workers' compensation. We have maintained this same level of retention for fiscal 2017. These retention amounts are applicable to all of the states in which we operate, except with respect to workers' compensation insurance in two states in which we participate in state-sponsored insurance funds. Aggregate stop-loss coverage for automobile liability, general liability, and workers' compensation claims was $84.6 million for fiscal 2016 and is $103.7 million for fiscal 2017.\nWe are party to a stop-loss agreement for losses under our employee group health plan. For calendar years 2014 and 2015, we retained the risk of loss up to the first $250,000 of claims per participant as well as an annual aggregate amount. With regard to losses occurring in calendar year 2016, we retain the risk of loss, on an annual basis, up to the first $400,000 of claims per participant as well as an annual aggregate amount.\nStock-Based Compensation. The Company has certain stock-based compensation plans under which it grants stock-based awards, including stock options, restricted share units, and performance share units to attract, retain, and reward talented employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have granted stock-based awards under\nour 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2012 Plan\u201d), 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2003 Plan\u201d) and 2007 Non-Employee Directors Equity Plan ( 2007 Directors Plan\u201d and, together with the 2012 Plan and 2003 Plan, the Plans\u201d). Our policy is to issue new shares to satisfy equity awards under the Plans. The total number of shares available for grant under the Plans as of July 30, 2016 was 1,023,162.\nCompensation expense for stock-based awards is based on fair value at the measurement date and fluctuates over time as a result of the vesting period of the stock-based awards and our performance, as measured by criteria set forth in the performance-based awards. This expense is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and the amount of expense ultimately recognized depends on the number of awards that actually vest. For performance-based restricted share units ( Performance RSUs\u201d), we evaluate compensation expense quarterly and recognize expense for performance-based awards only if we determine it is probable that the performance measures for the awards will be met. In the event we determine it is no longer probable that we will achieve certain performance measures for the awards, the associated stock-based compensation expense that we had previously recognized is reversed in the period such a determination is made. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense may vary from fiscal year to fiscal year.\nThe fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock options generally vest ratably over a four-year period and are exercisable over a period of up to ten years. The fair value of time-based restricted share units ( RSUs\u201d) and Performance RSUs is estimated on the date of grant and is generally equal to the closing stock price on that date. RSUs and Performance RSUs are settled in one share of our common stock upon vesting. RSUs vest ratably over a period of four years. Performance RSUs vest over a period of three years from the date of grant if certain performance measures are achieved. The performance measures for target awards are based on our fiscal year operating earnings (adjusted for certain amounts) as a percentage of contract revenues and our fiscal year operating cash flow level. Additionally, certain Performance RSU awards include three-year performance measures that, if met, result in supplemental shares being awarded. The three-year performance measures required to earn supplemental awards are more difficult to achieve than those required to earn annual target awards and are based on our three-year cumulative operating earnings (adjusted for certain amounts) as a percentage of contract revenues and our three-year cumulative operating cash flow level.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate for the tax jurisdictions where we operate primarily as the result of the impact of non-deductible and non-taxable items and tax credits recognized in relation to pre-tax results. Measurement of our tax position is based on the applicable statutes, federal and state case law, and our interpretations of tax regulations. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all relevant factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, we would adjust the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC Topic 740\u201d), we recognize tax benefits in the amount that we deem more likely than not will be realized upon ultimate settlement of any tax uncertainty. Tax positions that fail to qualify for recognition are recognized in the period in which the more-likely-than-not standard has been reached, when the tax positions are resolved with the respective taxing authority or when the statute of limitations for tax examination has expired. We recognize applicable interest related to tax amounts in interest expense and penalties within general and administrative expenses.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we adopted new IRS regulations for capitalizing and deducting costs incurred to acquire, produce, or improve tangible property. The new regulations did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nContingencies and Litigation. In the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in certain legal proceedings. Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 450, Contingencies ( ASC Topic 450\u201d) requires an estimated loss from a loss contingency be accrued by a charge to operating results if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. If only a range of probable loss can be determined, we accrue for our best estimate within the range for the contingency. In those cases where none of the estimates within the range is better than another, we accrue for the amount representing the low end of the range in accordance with ASC Topic 450. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending contingencies and litigation and revise our estimates as applicable. Revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations.\nAdditionally, if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected, it would result in a charge to operating results when determined.\nBusiness Combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price of each business acquired is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on information regarding their respective fair values on the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the separately identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. We determine the fair values used in purchase price allocations for intangible assets based on historical data, estimated discounted future cash flows, contract backlog amounts, if applicable, and expected royalty rates for trademarks and trade names, as well as certain other information. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires a number of judgments and is subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available. Additional information, which existed as of the acquisition date but unknown to us at that time, may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date. Adjustments in the purchase price allocation may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill and intangible assets. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. The results of operations of businesses acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from their dates of acquisition.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. As of July 30, 2016, we had $310.2 million of goodwill, $4.7 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets and $193.2 million of finite-lived intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. As of July 25, 2015, we had $271.7 million of goodwill, $4.7 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets and $116.2 million of finite-lived intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. The increase in goodwill during fiscal 2016 is primarily the result of preliminary purchase price allocations associated with businesses acquired in fiscal 2016. The increase in net intangible assets is a result of businesses acquired during fiscal 2016, partially offset by amortization of intangibles during fiscal 2016. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe account for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC Topic 350\u201d). Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, or more frequently if events occur that would indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill at the reporting unit level. Each of our operating segments with goodwill represents a reporting unit for the purpose of assessing impairment. If we determine the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized and reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we review finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability is determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition. Should an asset not be recoverable, an impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If we determine the fair value of an asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred.\nWe use judgment in assessing whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired. Estimates of fair value are based on our projection of revenues, operating costs, and cash flows taking into consideration historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived equally from the income approach and the market approach valuation methodologies. The income approach uses the discounted cash flow method and the market approach uses the guideline company method. Changes in our judgments and projections could result in significantly different estimates of fair value, potentially resulting in impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets. The inputs used for fair value measurements of the reporting units and other related indefinite-lived intangible assets are the lowest level (Level 3) inputs.\nOur goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand and the level of overall economic activity including, in particular, construction and housing activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects during times of slowing economic conditions. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers may also cause results to vary. These factors may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the Company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units could decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.\nWe evaluate current operating results, including any losses, in the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The estimates and assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties. Changes in judgments and estimates could result in significantly different estimates of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in impairments of goodwill or intangible assets of the reporting units. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.\nWe performed our annual impairment assessment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 and concluded that no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset was indicated at any reporting unit for any of the years. Qualitative assessments on reporting units that comprise a substantial portion of our consolidated goodwill balance and on our indefinite-lived intangible asset were performed. A qualitative assessment includes evaluating all identified events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset for the purpose of determining whether it is more likely than not that these assets are impaired. We consider various factors while performing qualitative assessments, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, financial performance of the reporting units, changes in market capitalization, and any other specific reporting unit considerations. These qualitative assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value exceeded carrying value for those reporting units. For the remaining reporting units, we performed the first step of the quantitative analysis described in ASC Topic 350. Under the income approach, the key valuation assumptions used in determining the fair value estimates of our reporting units for each annual test were (a) a discount rate based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for certain risks for the reporting units; (b) terminal value based on terminal growth rates; and (c) seven expected years of cash flow before the terminal value. The table below outlines certain assumptions in each of our fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 annual quantitative impairment analyses:\n\nThe discount rate reflects risks inherent within each reporting unit operating individually. These risks are greater than the risks inherent in the Company as a whole. The fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 analyses used the same discount rate and included consideration of market inputs such as the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, industry premium, and cost of debt, among other assumptions. The changes in these inputs from fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 had offsetting impacts and the discount rate remained at 11.5%. We believe the assumptions used in the impairment analysis each year are reflective of the risks inherent in the business models of our reporting units and within our industry. Under the market approach, the guideline company method develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies. Key valuation assumptions and valuation multiples used in determining the fair value estimates of our reporting units rely on (a) the selection of similar companies; (b) obtaining estimates of forecast revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the similar companies; and (c) selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics.\nWe determined that the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values in the fiscal 2016 annual assessment. Management determined that significant changes were not likely in the factors considered to estimate fair value, and analyzed the impact of such changes were they to occur. Specifically, if there was a 25% decrease in the fair value of any of the reporting units due to a decline in their discounted cash flows resulting from lower operating performance, the conclusion of the assessment would remain unchanged. Additionally, if the discount rate applied in the fiscal 2016 impairment analysis had been 100 basis points higher than estimated for each of the reporting units, and all other assumptions were held constant, the conclusion of the assessment would remain unchanged and there would be no impairment of goodwill. As of July 30, 2016, we believe the goodwill is recoverable for all of the reporting units; however, there can be no assurances that goodwill may not be impaired in future periods.\nCertain of our reporting units also have other intangible assets, including customer relationships, contract backlog, trade names, and non-compete intangibles. As of July 30, 2016, we believe that the carrying amounts of these intangible assets are recoverable. However, if adverse events were to occur or circumstances were to change indicating that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable, the assets would be reviewed for impairment and the assets could be impaired.\nOutlook\nSignificant developments in consumer applications continue to increase the demands for greater capacity and enhanced reliability from the wireline and wireless networks of our customers. A proliferation of technological developments has been made possible by improved networks and their underlying fiber connections. Faster broadband connections are enabling the creation of other industries in which products and services rely on robust network connections for advanced functionality. Telecommunications providers will continue to expand their network capabilities to meet the demand of their consumers, driving demand for our services as these providers outsource a significant portion of their engineering, construction, maintenance, and installation requirements.\nTelecommunications network operators are increasingly deploying fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers and businesses in order to respond to consumer demand, competitive realities, and public policy support. Fiber deployments have enabled cable companies to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services. Additionally, fiber deployments are enabling video services for local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high-speed data services. Several large telephone companies have pursued fiber-to-the-premise and fiber-to-the-node initiatives to compete actively with cable operators. Some telephone companies, which have previously deployed fiber-to-the-node architectures, have definitively transitioned to fiber-to-the-home architectures, while others are beginning to provision video over their fiber-to-the-node architectures. Further, many industry participants are deploying networks designed to provision 1-gigabit speeds to individual consumers and some have articulated plans to deploy speeds beyond 1-gigabit. Cable companies continue to increase the speeds of their services to residential customers and to deploy fiber to business customers with increasing urgency. Often these services to businesses are provided over fiber optic cables using metro Ethernet\u201d technology. The commercial geographies targeted by cable companies for network deployments generally require incremental fiber optic cable deployment and, as a result, require our services. These long-term initiatives and the possibility that other industry participants may pursue similar strategies create opportunities for us.\nWe expect the continued expansion of networks into areas of the U.S. that are currently unserved or underserved by high-speed broadband. Phase II of the Connect America Fund has been established to improve rural networks. This six-year program, administered by the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC\u201d), will provide $1.676 billion in funding per year to price cap carriers and others to expand and support broadband deployments in rural areas. In aggregate, our current customers, including several of our top ten customers, have accepted over $1.496 billion in funding per year under this program. New projects resulting from the Connect America Fund II are in planning, engineering, and construction. These projects are deploying fiber deeper into rural networks, and more are expected as new multi-year opportunities emerge. These opportunities also include fixed wireless deployments. We expect this program to contribute to demand for services in our industry.\nSignificant demand for wireless broadband is driven by the proliferation of smart phones and other mobile data devices. To respond to this demand, and other advances in technology, wireless carriers are upgrading their networks to 4G technologies and contemplating next generation mobile solutions such as small cells and 5G technologies. Wireless carriers are actively spending on their networks to respond to the explosion in wireless data traffic, to upgrade network technologies to improve performance and efficiency, and to consolidate disparate technology platforms. These initiatives present long-term opportunities for us with the wireless service providers we serve. Further, the demand for mobile broadband has increased bandwidth requirements on the wired networks of our customers. As the demand for mobile broadband grows, the amount of wireless traffic that must be backhauled\u201d over customers' fiber networks increases and, as a result, carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites and small cells. These trends are also driving the demand for our services and the increasing wireless data traffic is prompting further wireline deployments.\nSignificant consolidation and merger activity among telecommunications providers can also provide increased demand for our services as networks are integrated. As a result of recent merger activity, several of our large customers have committed to the FCC to expand and increase broadband network capabilities. These customer activities may further create a competitive response that will drive long-term demand for our services.\nOverall economic activity, including in particular construction and housing activity, also contributes to the demand for our services. Within the context of the current economy, we believe the latest trends and developments support our industry outlook. We will continue to closely monitor the effects that changes in economic and market conditions may have on our customers and our business and we will continue to manage those areas of the business we can control.\nResults of Operations\nThe results of operations of businesses acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from their dates of acquisition. The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated and the amounts as a percentage of revenue (totals may not add due to rounding) (dollars in millions):\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in July. As a result, each fiscal year consists of either 52 weeks or 53 weeks of operations (with the additional week of operations occurring in the fourth quarter). Fiscal 2016 consisted of 53 weeks of operations. Fiscal 2015 and 2014 each consisted of 52 weeks of operations. Fiscal 2017 will consist of 52 weeks of operations.\nYear Ended July 30, 2016 Compared to Year Ended July 25, 2015\nRevenues. Revenues increased to $2.673 billion during fiscal 2016 from $2.022 billion during fiscal 2015. Revenues increased in the current period primarily from services for customers deploying 1-gigabit networks, new awards with significant customers, and revenues generated by businesses acquired during fiscal 2016 and 2015. Additionally, fiscal 2016 included an additional week of operations as a result of our fiscal calendar.\nDuring fiscal 2016 and 2015, total revenues of $159.0 million and $17.7 million, respectively, were generated by businesses that were not owned for the full year in both the current and prior fiscal years. Excluding these amounts, revenues increased by approximately $508.9 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Revenues increased by approximately $224.9 million for a significant telecommunications customer improving its network and by approximately $139.7 million for a large telecommunications customer primarily for increased activity for services performed under new awards. Revenues increased for a leading cable multiple system operator by approximately $102.8 million from installation, maintenance and construction services, including services to provision fiber to small and medium businesses as well as network improvements. Further, revenues increased by approximately $69.3 million for services performed for a telecommunications customer in connection with rural services. Revenues also increased for services performed on a customer's fiber network by approximately $54.5 million. Partially offsetting these increases, revenues related to stimulus work on projects funded in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 declined by $41.5 million during fiscal 2016 as the program was completed. In addition, revenues declined by $31.5 million for a customer where we were providing fiber construction on their end customer's network. All other customers, on a combined basis, had net decreases in revenues of $9.3 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.\nThe percentage of our revenue by customer type from telecommunications, underground facility locating, and electric and gas utilities and other customers, was approximately 90.7%, 5.9%, and 3.4%, respectively, for fiscal 2016, compared to 90.0%, 6.2%, and 3.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2015.\nCosts of Earned Revenues. Costs of earned revenues increased to $2.084 billion during fiscal 2016, compared to $1.593 billion during fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to a higher level of operations during fiscal 2016, including the operating costs of businesses acquired during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 as well as an additional week of operations during fiscal 2016 as a result of our fiscal calendar. The primary components of the increase were a $410.5 million aggregate increase in direct labor and subcontractor costs, $46.3 million increase in direct material costs, $13.0 million net increase in equipment rental, maintenance and fuel costs, and $20.5 million net increase in other direct costs.\nCosts of earned revenues as a percentage of contract revenue decreased 0.8% during fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015. Direct material costs and other direct costs combined decreased 2.2% of contract revenue primarily as a result of operating leverage on our increased level of operations, mix of work, and from lower fuel prices. Partially offsetting these decreases, labor and subcontractor costs increased 1.4% of contract revenue for fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in labor and subcontractor costs as a percentage of contract revenue primarily resulted from changes in work type mix and costs incurred to expand operations for several large customer programs, including the impact on productivity. Additionally, during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we experienced a more pronounced seasonal impact from the businesses acquired during calendar year 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $217.1 million, or 8.1% of contract revenue during fiscal 2016, compared to $178.7 million, or 8.8% of contract revenue, during fiscal 2015. The increase in total general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2016 primarily resulted from increased payroll and performance-based compensation costs, costs of businesses acquired in fiscal 2016 and 2015, and increased technology and facilities costs as we expanded our operations. We recognized approximately $0.7 million of acquisition costs during fiscal 2016 in connection with a business acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Additionally, stock-based compensation increased to $16.8 million during fiscal 2016, compared to $13.9 million during fiscal 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenue is due to operating leverage on our increased level of operations.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $124.9 million and $96.0 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, and totaled 4.7% of contract revenue during each fiscal year. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during fiscal 2016 is primarily a result of the addition of fixed assets during fiscal 2016 and 2015 and incremental expense of businesses acquired in fiscal 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense was $19.4 million and $16.7 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net was $34.7 million and $27.0 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense includes approximately $14.7 million for the non-cash amortization of debt discount associated with our convertible senior notes during fiscal 2016. Excluding this amortization, interest expense, net decreased to $20.0 million during fiscal 2016 primarily due to a lower interest coupon rate on the convertible senior notes issued in September 2015 compared to the previously outstanding 7.125% Notes. See Note 10, Debt, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's debt transactions.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment. In connection with the redemption of our 7.125% Notes, we incurred a pre-tax charge for early extinguishment of debt of approximately $16.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This charge is comprised of: (i) $4.9 million for the present value of the interest payments for the period from the redemption date of October 15, 2015 through January 15, 2016, (ii) $6.5 million for the excess of the present value of the redemption price over the carrying value of the 7.125% Notes, and (iii) $4.9 million for the write-off of deferred financing charges related to the fees incurred in connection with the issuance of the 7.125% Notes.\nOther Income, Net. Other income was $10.4 million and $8.3 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in other income, net is primarily a function of the number of assets sold and prices obtained for those assets during fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015. Other income, net during fiscal 2016 also includes immaterial discount fees related to a customer-sponsored vendor payment program in which we participate. Under this program, accounts receivable are collected on an expedited basis pursuant to a non-recourse sale of the receivables to a bank partner of the customer. The program significantly reduces the time required to collect that customer's receivables.\nIncome Taxes. The following table presents our income tax provision and effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):\n\nFluctuations in our effective income tax rate were primarily attributable to the difference in income tax rates from state to state, non-deductible and non-taxable items, disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock option exercises, and production-related tax deductions recognized in relation to our pre-tax results during the periods. The decrease in our effective income tax rate during the current year period, as compared to the prior year period, is primarily due to increased production-related tax deductions recognized in relation to higher pre-tax results in the current period and a lesser impact of non-deductible items. We had total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $2.4 million and $2.3 million as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, respectively, which, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.\nNet Income. Net income was $128.7 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $84.3 million for fiscal 2015.\nYear Ended July 25, 2015 Compared to Year Ended July 26, 2014\nRevenues. Revenues increased to $2.022 billion during fiscal 2015 from $1.812 billion during fiscal 2014. Revenues increased in fiscal 2015 from services for customers deploying 1-gigabit networks and from new awards with significant customers. Additionally, work performed during fiscal 2015 was significantly less impacted by weather conditions as compared to fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2015, total revenues of $40.4 million were generated by businesses acquired during fiscal 2015 as well as during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014, total revenues of $2.8 million were generated by businesses acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Excluding amounts from these businesses that were not owned for the full year in both fiscal years, revenues increased by approximately $173.1 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Revenues increased for a significant customer investing in improvements to its networks by approximately $56.3 million. Revenues also increased for services performed on a customer's fiber network by approximately $55.1 million. In addition, revenues increased for a leading cable multiple system operator by approximately $48.2 million from maintenance and construction services, including services to provision fiber to small and medium businesses as well as network improvements. Other increases in revenue include increases of approximately $39.9 million for a customer for which we are performing fiber construction services on their end customer's network and increases of approximately $24.0 million for a large telecommunications customer investing in improvements to its network. Partially offsetting these increases, revenues related to stimulus work on projects funded in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 declined by approximately $61.4 million during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014, as the program was completed. Furthermore, revenues for a cable multiple system operator declined $17.9 million. All other customers, on a combined basis, had net increases in revenues of $28.9 million during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014.\nThe percentage of our revenue by customer type from telecommunications, underground facility locating, and electric and gas utilities and other customers, was approximately 90.0%, 6.2%, and 3.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2015, compared to 88.2%, 7.0% and 4.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2014.\nCosts of Earned Revenues. Costs of earned revenues increased to $1.593 billion during fiscal 2015, compared to $1.475 billion during fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to a higher level of operations during fiscal 2015, including the operating costs of businesses acquired during fiscal 2015 and 2014. The primary components of the increase were a $102.4 million aggregate increase in direct labor and subcontractor costs, $16.1 million increase in direct material costs, and $8.8 million increase in other direct costs, including insurance claim expense. These increases were partially offset by a $9.1 million aggregate decrease from lower fuel consumption and lower fuel prices during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014.\nCosts of earned revenues as a percentage of contract revenue decreased 2.6% during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was partially due to higher productivity resulting from the mix of work performed and better weather conditions during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2015, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2014. Adverse weather conditions during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2014 negatively impacted productivity and margins during those periods. Labor and subcontractor costs represented a lower percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2015 and decreased 1.0% as a percentage of\ncontract revenue, compared to fiscal 2014, as a result of improved operating efficiency based on the mix of work performed. In addition, costs decreased 0.7% from lower fuel consumption and lower fuel prices. Direct material costs decreased 0.2% as a percentage of contract revenue and other direct costs decreased 0.7% as a percentage of contract revenue, compared to fiscal 2014, as a result of improved operating leverage on our increased level of operations.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $178.7 million, or 8.8% as a percentage of contract revenue, during fiscal 2015, compared to $161.9 million, or 8.9% as a percentage of contract revenue, during fiscal 2014. The increase in total general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2015 resulted from increased payroll and performance-based compensation costs, higher legal and other professional fees, and the costs of businesses acquired in fiscal 2015 and 2014. Additionally, stock-based compensation increased to $13.9 million during fiscal 2015, from $12.6 million during fiscal 2014. Stock-based compensation recognized in fiscal 2014 for Performance RSUs was lower than fiscal 2015 because the Company did not fully achieve the performance goals set forth for the fiscal 2014 performance period.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased to $96.0 million during fiscal 2015, from $92.8 million during fiscal 2014, and totaled 4.7% and 5.1% of contract revenue, respectively. The increase in depreciation expense, arising from the addition of fixed assets during fiscal 2015 and depreciation from businesses acquired in fiscal 2015 and 2014, was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense. Amortization expense decreased to $16.7 million during fiscal 2015 from $18.3 million during fiscal 2014. The decrease in amortization expense was a result of certain contract backlog intangible assets of the telecommunications infrastructure services subsidiaries acquired from Quanta Services, Inc. becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net was $27.0 million and $26.8 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase for fiscal 2015 reflects higher debt balances outstanding for a longer time period during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The additional cost on incremental debt was partially offset by lower interest rates on the outstanding balances as a result of the amendment of our credit agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net was $8.3 million and $11.2 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in other income was primarily a function of the number of assets sold and prices obtained for those assets during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014.\nIncome Taxes. The following table presents our income tax provision and effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, as well as Part I, Item 1, Business, and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntroduction\nWe are a leading provider of specialty contracting services throughout the United States and in Canada. Our subsidiary companies provide program management, engineering, construction, maintenance, and installation services for telecommunications providers, underground facility locating services for various utilities, including telecommunications providers, and other construction and maintenance services for electric and gas utilities. We provide the labor, tools and equipment necessary to design, engineer, locate, maintain, expand, install and upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure of our customers.\nSignificant developments in consumer applications within the telecommunications industry, including advanced digital and video service offerings, continue to increase the demand for greater capacity and enhanced reliability from our customers' wireline and wireless networks. Telecommunications providers outsource a significant portion of their engineering, construction, maintenance, and installation requirements, driving demand for our services.\nTelecommunications network operators are increasingly deploying fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers and businesses in order to respond to consumer demand, competitive realities, and public policy support. Several large telephone companies have pursued fiber-to-the-premise and fiber-to-the-node initiatives to compete actively with cable operators. Some telephone companies, which have previously deployed fiber-to-the-node architectures, have definitively transitioned to fiber-to-the-home architectures, while others are beginning to provision video over their fiber-to-the-node architectures. Cable companies continue to increase the speeds of their services to residential customers and to deploy fiber to business customers with increasing urgency. Many industry participants are deploying networks designed to provision 1 gigabit speeds to individual consumers and some have articulated plans to deploy speeds beyond 1-gigabit.\nOpportunities exist to improve rural networks as a result of Phase II of the Connect America Fund. This six-year program, administered by the Federal Communications Commission, will provide $1.676 billion in funding per year to price cap carriers and others to expand and support broadband deployments in rural areas. In aggregate, our current customers, including several of our top ten customers, have accepted over $1.496 billion in funding per year under this program. New projects resulting from the Connect America Fund Phase II are in planning, engineering, and construction. These projects are deploying fiber deeper into rural networks, and more are expected as new multi-year opportunities emerge. These opportunities also include fixed wireless deployments. We expect this program to contribute to demand for services in our industry.\nSignificant demand for wireless broadband is driven by the proliferation of smart phones and other mobile data devices. Wireless carriers are actively spending on their networks to respond to the significant increase in wireless data traffic, to upgrade network technologies to improve performance and efficiency, and to consolidate disparate technology platforms. As the demand for mobile broadband grows, the amount of wireless traffic that must be backhauled\u201d over customers' fiber networks increases and, as a result, carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites and small cells. These trends are driving demand for our services and the increasing wireless data traffic is prompting further wireline deployments.\nThe cyclical nature of the industry we serve may affect demand for our services. The capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers, and the related timing of approvals and seasonal spending patterns, influence our revenues and results of operations. The business demands of our customers and the demands of their consumers, the introduction of new communication technologies, the physical maintenance needs of customer infrastructure, the actions of our government and the FCC, and overall economic conditions may affect the capital expenditures and maintenance budgets of our telecommunications\ncustomers. Changes in our mix of customers, contracts, and business activities, as well as changes in the general level of construction activity also drive variations in revenues and results of operations.\nCustomer Relationships and Contractual Arrangements\nWe have established relationships with many leading telecommunications providers, including telephone companies, cable television multiple system operators, wireless carriers, telecommunication equipment and infrastructure providers, and electric and gas utilities. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers in each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 accounting for approximately 69.7%, 61.1% and 58.3% of our total revenues, respectively. The following reflects the percentage of total revenue from customers who contributed at least 2.5% to our total revenue during fiscal 2016, 2015, or 2014:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AT&T Inc.\n</td> <td>24.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CenturyLink, Inc.\n</td> <td>14.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comcast Corporation\n</td> <td>13.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Verizon Communications Inc.\n</td> <td>11.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charter Communications, Inc.(1)\n</td> <td>6.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Windstream Corporation\n</td> <td>5.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) For comparison purposes in the above table, revenues from Charter Communications, Inc., Time Warner Cable Inc., and Bright House Networks, LLC have been combined for periods prior to their May 2016 merger.\nIn addition, another customer contributed 6.2%, 5.6%, and 3.2% to our total revenue during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nWe generally possess multiple agreements with each of our significant customers. To the extent that such agreements specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the customer's ability to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, the performance of work with the customer's own employees, and the use of other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility. In most cases, a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience with written notice. Historically, multi-year master service agreements have been awarded primarily through a competitive bidding process, however, we occasionally are able to extend these agreements through negotiations. Revenues from multi-year master service agreements were approximately 61.4% during fiscal 2016, and 65.2% during each of fiscal 2015 and 2014.\nWe provide the remainder of our services pursuant to contracts for specific projects. These contracts may be long-term (with terms greater than one year) or short-term (with terms generally three to four months in duration) and often include customary retainage provisions under which the customer may withhold 5% to 10% of the invoiced amounts pending project completion. Revenues from long-term contracts for specific projects were 19.6%, 14.7%, and 13.7%, as a percentage of total contract revenues during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. We regularly review opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify, acquire, and successfully integrate companies.\nFiscal 2016 - During August 2015, we acquired TelCom Construction, Inc. and an affiliate (together, TelCom\u201d). The purchase price was $48.8 million paid in cash. TelCom, based in Clearwater, Minnesota, provides construction and maintenance services for telecommunications providers throughout the United States. This acquisition expands our geographical presence within our existing customer base. During July 2016, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with the wireless network deployment and wireline operations of Goodman Networks Incorporated ( Goodman\u201d) for a cash purchase price of $107.5 million, subject to working capital adjustments. The total cash transaction consideration paid was $102.8 million after a preliminary working capital adjustment of $4.7 million. The acquired operations\nprovide wireless construction services in a number of markets, including Texas, Georgia, and Southern California. The acquisition reinforces our wireless construction resources and expands our geographical presence within our existing customer base. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we acquired NextGen Telecom Services Group, Inc. ( NextGen\u201d) for $5.6 million, net of cash acquired. NextGen provides construction and maintenance services for telecommunications providers in the Northeastern United States.\nWith respect to the Goodman acquisition, $22.5 million of the purchase price was placed into an escrow account, $2.5 million of which is available for working capital adjustments and $20.0 million of which is available to us for indemnification obligations of the seller. Of the $20.0 million available for indemnification obligations, $10.0 million will be released to the seller upon the occurrence of certain conditions, but in no event earlier than the twelve-month anniversary of the closing date. The remaining $10.0 million will be released to the seller when the seller satisfies certain conditions with respect to a dispute with the state of Texas over a sales tax liability of approximately $31.7 million (the Sales Tax Liability\u201d). Under the purchase agreement, Goodman has retained responsibility for this Sales Tax Liability. Should Goodman not resolve this matter, the state may assert that we are a successor to the operations and seek to recover from us. In such event we would seek indemnification for recovery from Goodman, including from the funds contained in the escrow account, for any amount we pay.\nFiscal 2015 - During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we acquired Hewitt Power & Communications, Inc. ( Hewitt\u201d) for $8.0 million, net of cash acquired. Hewitt provides specialty contracting services primarily for telecommunications providers in the Southeastern United States. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we acquired the assets of two cable installation contractors for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we acquired Moll's Utility Services, LLC ( Moll's\u201d) for $6.5 million, net of cash acquired. Moll's provides specialty contracting services primarily for utilities in the Midwest United States. We also acquired the assets of Venture Communications Group, LLC ( Venture\u201d) for $15.6 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Venture provides specialty contracting services primarily for telecommunications providers in the Midwest and Southeastern United States.\nFiscal 2014 - During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired a telecommunications specialty construction contractor in Canada for $0.7 million. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired Watts Brothers Cable Construction, Inc. ( Watts Brothers\u201d) for $16.4 million. Watts Brothers provides specialty contracting services primarily for telecommunications providers in the Midwest and Southeastern United States.\nUnderstanding Our Results of Operations\nThe following information is presented in order for the reader to better understand certain factors impacting our results of operations and profitability, and should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below as well as Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues. We perform a majority of our services under master service agreements and other agreements that contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discrete pricing for individual tasks. Revenue is recognized under these arrangements based on units-of-delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed. The remainder of our services are performed under contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting as more fully described within Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below.\nCost of Earned Revenues. Cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts, including costs for direct labor provided by employees, services by independent subcontractors, operation of capital equipment (excluding depreciation), direct materials, insurance costs, and other direct costs. For claims within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), workers' compensation, and employee group health.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses, including performance-based compensation and stock-based compensation, legal, consulting and professional fees, information technology and development costs, provision for or recoveries of bad debt expense, acquisition and integration costs of businesses acquired, and other costs not directly related to the provision of our services under customer contracts. We incur information technology and development costs primarily to support and enhance our operating efficiency. To protect our rights, we have filed for patents on certain of our innovations. Our executive management team and the senior management of our subsidiaries perform substantially all of our sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Our property and equipment primarily consist of vehicles, equipment and machinery, and computer hardware and software. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. In addition, we have intangible assets, including customer relationships, contract backlog, trade names, and non-compete intangibles, which we amortize over the estimated useful lives. We recognize amortization of customer relationship intangibles and acquired contract backlog intangibles on an accelerated basis as a function of the expected economic benefit. We recognize amortization of our other finite-lived intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment. Loss on debt extinguishment for fiscal 2016 includes pre-tax charges related to the redemption of our 7.125% senior subordinated notes (the 7.125% Notes\u201d), including the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs on the 7.125% Notes.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, consists of interest incurred on outstanding variable rate and fixed rate debt and certain other obligations. Interest expense also includes non-cash amortization of our convertible senior notes debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs. See Note 10, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the non-cash amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net, primarily consists of gains or losses from sales of fixed assets. Other income, net during fiscal 2016 also includes immaterial discount fees related to a customer-sponsored vendor payment program in which we participate. Under this program, accounts receivable are collected on an expedited basis pursuant to a non-recourse sale of the receivables to a bank partner of the customer. The program significantly reduces the time required to collect that customer's receivables.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations. Our revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, extended periods of adverse weather, which are more likely to occur during the winter season, impact our operations during our second and third fiscal quarters. In addition, a disproportionate percentage of paid holidays fall within our second fiscal quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Because of these factors, we are most likely to experience reduced revenue and profitability during our second and third fiscal quarters.\nWe experience quarterly variations in revenues and results of operations as a result of other factors as well. Such factors include fluctuations in insurance expense due to changes in claims experience and actuarial assumptions, variances in incentive pay and stock-based compensation expense as a result of operating performance and vesting provisions, and changes in the employer portion of payroll taxes, including unemployment taxes, as a result of reaching statutory limits. Other factors that may contribute to quarterly variations in results of operations include other income recognized as a result of the timing and levels of capital assets sold during the period, income tax expense attributable to levels of taxable earnings, and the impact of disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock option expenses.\nAccordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal period.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions require the use of judgment as to the likelihood of various future outcomes and, as a result, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nWe have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The impact of these policies affects our reported and expected financial results. We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies herein.\nOther significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below, are also important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion.\nRevenue Recognition. We perform a majority of our services under master service agreements and other agreements that contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discrete pricing for individual tasks. We recognize revenue under these arrangements based on units-of-delivery as each unit is completed. The remainder of our services, representing less than 5% of our contract revenues during fiscal 2016 and less than 10% of our contract revenues during each of fiscal 2015 and 2014, are performed under contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting. Revenue is recognized under these arrangements based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. For contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of completion, we accrue the entire amount of a contract loss at the time the loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. During each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, there was no material impact to our results of operations due to changes in contract estimates.\nThere were no material amounts of unapproved change orders or claims recognized during each of fiscal 2016, 2015, or 2014. The current asset Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The current liability Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on uncollected balances. Management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable balances each period. This analysis considers the aging of account balances, historical bad debt experience, changes in customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, customer payment activity, and other relevant factors. Should any of these factors change, the estimate made by management may also change, which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts. We recognize an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that a receivable is not collectible and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations.\nAccrued Insurance Claims. For claims within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), workers' compensation, and employee group health. We have established reserves that we believe to be adequate based on current evaluations and our experience with these types of claims. A liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is determined with the assistance of an actuary and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as accrued insurance claims. The effect on our financial statements is generally limited to the amount needed to satisfy our insurance deductibles or retentions. The liability for total accrued insurance claims and related processing costs was $89.7 million and $87.3 million as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, respectively, and included incurred but not reported losses of approximately $44.5 million and $39.4 million, respectively. Insurance recoveries/receivables related to accrued claims as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015 was $5.7 million and $9.5 million, respectively, of which $5.7 million and $8.9 million, respectively, was included in non-current other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. As of July 25, 2015, $0.6 million of insurance recoveries/receivables was included in other current assets.\nWe estimate the liability for claims based on facts, circumstances, and historical experience. Recorded loss reserves are not discounted even though they will not be paid until sometime in the future. Factors affecting the determination of the expected cost for existing and incurred but not reported claims include, but are not limited to, the magnitude and quantity of future claims, the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations.\nWith regard to losses occurring in fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016, we retain the risk of loss of up to $1.0 million on a per-occurrence basis for automobile liability, general liability, and workers' compensation. We have maintained this same level of retention for fiscal 2017. These retention amounts are applicable to all of the states in which we operate, except with respect to workers' compensation insurance in two states in which we participate in state-sponsored insurance funds. Aggregate stop-loss coverage for automobile liability, general liability, and workers' compensation claims was $84.6 million for fiscal 2016 and is $103.7 million for fiscal 2017.\nWe are party to a stop-loss agreement for losses under our employee group health plan. For calendar years 2014 and 2015, we retained the risk of loss up to the first $250,000 of claims per participant as well as an annual aggregate amount. With regard to losses occurring in calendar year 2016, we retain the risk of loss, on an annual basis, up to the first $400,000 of claims per participant as well as an annual aggregate amount.\nStock-Based Compensation. The Company has certain stock-based compensation plans under which it grants stock-based awards, including stock options, restricted share units, and performance share units to attract, retain, and reward talented employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have granted stock-based awards under\nour 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2012 Plan\u201d), 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2003 Plan\u201d) and 2007 Non-Employee Directors Equity Plan ( 2007 Directors Plan\u201d and, together with the 2012 Plan and 2003 Plan, the Plans\u201d). Our policy is to issue new shares to satisfy equity awards under the Plans. The total number of shares available for grant under the Plans as of July 30, 2016 was 1,023,162.\nCompensation expense for stock-based awards is based on fair value at the measurement date and fluctuates over time as a result of the vesting period of the stock-based awards and our performance, as measured by criteria set forth in the performance-based awards. This expense is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and the amount of expense ultimately recognized depends on the number of awards that actually vest. For performance-based restricted share units ( Performance RSUs\u201d), we evaluate compensation expense quarterly and recognize expense for performance-based awards only if we determine it is probable that the performance measures for the awards will be met. In the event we determine it is no longer probable that we will achieve certain performance measures for the awards, the associated stock-based compensation expense that we had previously recognized is reversed in the period such a determination is made. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense may vary from fiscal year to fiscal year.\nThe fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock options generally vest ratably over a four-year period and are exercisable over a period of up to ten years. The fair value of time-based restricted share units ( RSUs\u201d) and Performance RSUs is estimated on the date of grant and is generally equal to the closing stock price on that date. RSUs and Performance RSUs are settled in one share of our common stock upon vesting. RSUs vest ratably over a period of four years. Performance RSUs vest over a period of three years from the date of grant if certain performance measures are achieved. The performance measures for target awards are based on our fiscal year operating earnings (adjusted for certain amounts) as a percentage of contract revenues and our fiscal year operating cash flow level. Additionally, certain Performance RSU awards include three-year performance measures that, if met, result in supplemental shares being awarded. The three-year performance measures required to earn supplemental awards are more difficult to achieve than those required to earn annual target awards and are based on our three-year cumulative operating earnings (adjusted for certain amounts) as a percentage of contract revenues and our three-year cumulative operating cash flow level.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate for the tax jurisdictions where we operate primarily as the result of the impact of non-deductible and non-taxable items and tax credits recognized in relation to pre-tax results. Measurement of our tax position is based on the applicable statutes, federal and state case law, and our interpretations of tax regulations. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all relevant factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, we would adjust the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC Topic 740\u201d), we recognize tax benefits in the amount that we deem more likely than not will be realized upon ultimate settlement of any tax uncertainty. Tax positions that fail to qualify for recognition are recognized in the period in which the more-likely-than-not standard has been reached, when the tax positions are resolved with the respective taxing authority or when the statute of limitations for tax examination has expired. We recognize applicable interest related to tax amounts in interest expense and penalties within general and administrative expenses.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we adopted new IRS regulations for capitalizing and deducting costs incurred to acquire, produce, or improve tangible property. The new regulations did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nContingencies and Litigation. In the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in certain legal proceedings. Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 450, Contingencies ( ASC Topic 450\u201d) requires an estimated loss from a loss contingency be accrued by a charge to operating results if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. If only a range of probable loss can be determined, we accrue for our best estimate within the range for the contingency. In those cases where none of the estimates within the range is better than another, we accrue for the amount representing the low end of the range in accordance with ASC Topic 450. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending contingencies and litigation and revise our estimates as applicable. Revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations.\nAdditionally, if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected, it would result in a charge to operating results when determined.\nBusiness Combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price of each business acquired is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on information regarding their respective fair values on the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the separately identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. We determine the fair values used in purchase price allocations for intangible assets based on historical data, estimated discounted future cash flows, contract backlog amounts, if applicable, and expected royalty rates for trademarks and trade names, as well as certain other information. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires a number of judgments and is subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available. Additional information, which existed as of the acquisition date but unknown to us at that time, may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date. Adjustments in the purchase price allocation may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill and intangible assets. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. The results of operations of businesses acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from their dates of acquisition.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. As of July 30, 2016, we had $310.2 million of goodwill, $4.7 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets and $193.2 million of finite-lived intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. As of July 25, 2015, we had $271.7 million of goodwill, $4.7 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets and $116.2 million of finite-lived intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. The increase in goodwill during fiscal 2016 is primarily the result of preliminary purchase price allocations associated with businesses acquired in fiscal 2016. The increase in net intangible assets is a result of businesses acquired during fiscal 2016, partially offset by amortization of intangibles during fiscal 2016. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe account for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC Topic 350\u201d). Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, or more frequently if events occur that would indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill at the reporting unit level. Each of our operating segments with goodwill represents a reporting unit for the purpose of assessing impairment. If we determine the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized and reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we review finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability is determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition. Should an asset not be recoverable, an impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If we determine the fair value of an asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred.\nWe use judgment in assessing whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired. Estimates of fair value are based on our projection of revenues, operating costs, and cash flows taking into consideration historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived equally from the income approach and the market approach valuation methodologies. The income approach uses the discounted cash flow method and the market approach uses the guideline company method. Changes in our judgments and projections could result in significantly different estimates of fair value, potentially resulting in impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets. The inputs used for fair value measurements of the reporting units and other related indefinite-lived intangible assets are the lowest level (Level 3) inputs.\nOur goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand and the level of overall economic activity including, in particular, construction and housing activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects during times of slowing economic conditions. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers may also cause results to vary. These factors may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the Company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units could decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.\nWe evaluate current operating results, including any losses, in the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The estimates and assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties. Changes in judgments and estimates could result in significantly different estimates of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in impairments of goodwill or intangible assets of the reporting units. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.\nWe performed our annual impairment assessment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 and concluded that no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset was indicated at any reporting unit for any of the years. Qualitative assessments on reporting units that comprise a substantial portion of our consolidated goodwill balance and on our indefinite-lived intangible asset were performed. A qualitative assessment includes evaluating all identified events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset for the purpose of determining whether it is more likely than not that these assets are impaired. We consider various factors while performing qualitative assessments, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, financial performance of the reporting units, changes in market capitalization, and any other specific reporting unit considerations. These qualitative assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value exceeded carrying value for those reporting units. For the remaining reporting units, we performed the first step of the quantitative analysis described in ASC Topic 350. Under the income approach, the key valuation assumptions used in determining the fair value estimates of our reporting units for each annual test were (a) a discount rate based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for certain risks for the reporting units; (b) terminal value based on terminal growth rates; and (c) seven expected years of cash flow before the terminal value. The table below outlines certain assumptions in each of our fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 annual quantitative impairment analyses:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminal Growth Rate Range\n</td> <td>2.0% - 3.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5% - 2.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5% - 3.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>11.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe discount rate reflects risks inherent within each reporting unit operating individually. These risks are greater than the risks inherent in the Company as a whole. The fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 analyses used the same discount rate and included consideration of market inputs such as the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, industry premium, and cost of debt, among other assumptions. The changes in these inputs from fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 had offsetting impacts and the discount rate remained at 11.5%. We believe the assumptions used in the impairment analysis each year are reflective of the risks inherent in the business models of our reporting units and within our industry. Under the market approach, the guideline company method develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies. Key valuation assumptions and valuation multiples used in determining the fair value estimates of our reporting units rely on (a) the selection of similar companies; (b) obtaining estimates of forecast revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the similar companies; and (c) selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics.\nWe determined that the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values in the fiscal 2016 annual assessment. Management determined that significant changes were not likely in the factors considered to estimate fair value, and analyzed the impact of such changes were they to occur. Specifically, if there was a 25% decrease in the fair value of any of the reporting units due to a decline in their discounted cash flows resulting from lower operating performance, the conclusion of the assessment would remain unchanged. Additionally, if the discount rate applied in the fiscal 2016 impairment analysis had been 100 basis points higher than estimated for each of the reporting units, and all other assumptions were held constant, the conclusion of the assessment would remain unchanged and there would be no impairment of goodwill. As of July 30, 2016, we believe the goodwill is recoverable for all of the reporting units; however, there can be no assurances that goodwill may not be impaired in future periods.\nCertain of our reporting units also have other intangible assets, including customer relationships, contract backlog, trade names, and non-compete intangibles. As of July 30, 2016, we believe that the carrying amounts of these intangible assets are recoverable. However, if adverse events were to occur or circumstances were to change indicating that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable, the assets would be reviewed for impairment and the assets could be impaired.\nOutlook\nSignificant developments in consumer applications continue to increase the demands for greater capacity and enhanced reliability from the wireline and wireless networks of our customers. A proliferation of technological developments has been made possible by improved networks and their underlying fiber connections. Faster broadband connections are enabling the creation of other industries in which products and services rely on robust network connections for advanced functionality. Telecommunications providers will continue to expand their network capabilities to meet the demand of their consumers, driving demand for our services as these providers outsource a significant portion of their engineering, construction, maintenance, and installation requirements.\nTelecommunications network operators are increasingly deploying fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers and businesses in order to respond to consumer demand, competitive realities, and public policy support. Fiber deployments have enabled cable companies to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services. Additionally, fiber deployments are enabling video services for local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high-speed data services. Several large telephone companies have pursued fiber-to-the-premise and fiber-to-the-node initiatives to compete actively with cable operators. Some telephone companies, which have previously deployed fiber-to-the-node architectures, have definitively transitioned to fiber-to-the-home architectures, while others are beginning to provision video over their fiber-to-the-node architectures. Further, many industry participants are deploying networks designed to provision 1-gigabit speeds to individual consumers and some have articulated plans to deploy speeds beyond 1-gigabit. Cable companies continue to increase the speeds of their services to residential customers and to deploy fiber to business customers with increasing urgency. Often these services to businesses are provided over fiber optic cables using metro Ethernet\u201d technology. The commercial geographies targeted by cable companies for network deployments generally require incremental fiber optic cable deployment and, as a result, require our services. These long-term initiatives and the possibility that other industry participants may pursue similar strategies create opportunities for us.\nWe expect the continued expansion of networks into areas of the U.S. that are currently unserved or underserved by high-speed broadband. Phase II of the Connect America Fund has been established to improve rural networks. This six-year program, administered by the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC\u201d), will provide $1.676 billion in funding per year to price cap carriers and others to expand and support broadband deployments in rural areas. In aggregate, our current customers, including several of our top ten customers, have accepted over $1.496 billion in funding per year under this program. New projects resulting from the Connect America Fund II are in planning, engineering, and construction. These projects are deploying fiber deeper into rural networks, and more are expected as new multi-year opportunities emerge. These opportunities also include fixed wireless deployments. We expect this program to contribute to demand for services in our industry.\nSignificant demand for wireless broadband is driven by the proliferation of smart phones and other mobile data devices. To respond to this demand, and other advances in technology, wireless carriers are upgrading their networks to 4G technologies and contemplating next generation mobile solutions such as small cells and 5G technologies. Wireless carriers are actively spending on their networks to respond to the explosion in wireless data traffic, to upgrade network technologies to improve performance and efficiency, and to consolidate disparate technology platforms. These initiatives present long-term opportunities for us with the wireless service providers we serve. Further, the demand for mobile broadband has increased bandwidth requirements on the wired networks of our customers. As the demand for mobile broadband grows, the amount of wireless traffic that must be backhauled\u201d over customers' fiber networks increases and, as a result, carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites and small cells. These trends are also driving the demand for our services and the increasing wireless data traffic is prompting further wireline deployments.\nSignificant consolidation and merger activity among telecommunications providers can also provide increased demand for our services as networks are integrated. As a result of recent merger activity, several of our large customers have committed to the FCC to expand and increase broadband network capabilities. These customer activities may further create a competitive response that will drive long-term demand for our services.\nOverall economic activity, including in particular construction and housing activity, also contributes to the demand for our services. Within the context of the current economy, we believe the latest trends and developments support our industry outlook. We will continue to closely monitor the effects that changes in economic and market conditions may have on our customers and our business and we will continue to manage those areas of the business we can control.\nResults of Operations\nThe results of operations of businesses acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from their dates of acquisition.

As a result, each fiscal year consists of either 52 weeks or 53 weeks of operations (with the additional week of operations occurring in the fourth quarter). Fiscal 2016 consisted of 53 weeks of operations. Fiscal 2015 and 2014 each consisted of 52 weeks of operations. Fiscal 2017 will consist of 52 weeks of operations.\nYear Ended July 30, 2016 Compared to Year Ended July 25, 2015\nRevenues. Revenues increased to $2.673 billion during fiscal 2016 from $2.022 billion during fiscal 2015. Revenues increased in the current period primarily from services for customers deploying 1-gigabit networks, new awards with significant customers, and revenues generated by businesses acquired during fiscal 2016 and 2015. Additionally, fiscal 2016 included an additional week of operations as a result of our fiscal calendar.\nDuring fiscal 2016 and 2015, total revenues of $159.0 million and $17.7 million, respectively, were generated by businesses that were not owned for the full year in both the current and prior fiscal years. Excluding these amounts, revenues increased by approximately $508.9 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Revenues increased by approximately $224.9 million for a significant telecommunications customer improving its network and by approximately $139.7 million for a large telecommunications customer primarily for increased activity for services performed under new awards. Revenues increased for a leading cable multiple system operator by approximately $102.8 million from installation, maintenance and construction services, including services to provision fiber to small and medium businesses as well as network improvements. Further, revenues increased by approximately $69.3 million for services performed for a telecommunications customer in connection with rural services. Revenues also increased for services performed on a customer's fiber network by approximately $54.5 million. Partially offsetting these increases, revenues related to stimulus work on projects funded in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 declined by $41.5 million during fiscal 2016 as the program was completed. In addition, revenues declined by $31.5 million for a customer where we were providing fiber construction on their end customer's network. All other customers, on a combined basis, had net decreases in revenues of $9.3 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.\nThe percentage of our revenue by customer type from telecommunications, underground facility locating, and electric and gas utilities and other customers, was approximately 90.7%, 5.9%, and 3.4%, respectively, for fiscal 2016, compared to 90.0%, 6.2%, and 3.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2015.\nCosts of Earned Revenues. Costs of earned revenues increased to $2.084 billion during fiscal 2016, compared to $1.593 billion during fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to a higher level of operations during fiscal 2016, including the operating costs of businesses acquired during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 as well as an additional week of operations during fiscal 2016 as a result of our fiscal calendar. The primary components of the increase were a $410.5 million aggregate increase in direct labor and subcontractor costs, $46.3 million increase in direct material costs, $13.0 million net increase in equipment rental, maintenance and fuel costs, and $20.5 million net increase in other direct costs.\nCosts of earned revenues as a percentage of contract revenue decreased 0.8% during fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015. Direct material costs and other direct costs combined decreased 2.2% of contract revenue primarily as a result of operating leverage on our increased level of operations, mix of work, and from lower fuel prices. Partially offsetting these decreases, labor and subcontractor costs increased 1.4% of contract revenue for fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in labor and subcontractor costs as a percentage of contract revenue primarily resulted from changes in work type mix and costs incurred to expand operations for several large customer programs, including the impact on productivity. Additionally, during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we experienced a more pronounced seasonal impact from the businesses acquired during calendar year 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $217.1 million, or 8.1% of contract revenue during fiscal 2016, compared to $178.7 million, or 8.8% of contract revenue, during fiscal 2015. The increase in total general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2016 primarily resulted from increased payroll and performance-based compensation costs, costs of businesses acquired in fiscal 2016 and 2015, and increased technology and facilities costs as we expanded our operations. We recognized approximately $0.7 million of acquisition costs during fiscal 2016 in connection with a business acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Additionally, stock-based compensation increased to $16.8 million during fiscal 2016, compared to $13.9 million during fiscal 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenue is due to operating leverage on our increased level of operations.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $124.9 million and $96.0 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, and totaled 4.7% of contract revenue during each fiscal year. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during fiscal 2016 is primarily a result of the addition of fixed assets during fiscal 2016 and 2015 and incremental expense of businesses acquired in fiscal 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense was $19.4 million and $16.7 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net was $34.7 million and $27.0 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense includes approximately $14.7 million for the non-cash amortization of debt discount associated with our convertible senior notes during fiscal 2016. Excluding this amortization, interest expense, net decreased to $20.0 million during fiscal 2016 primarily due to a lower interest coupon rate on the convertible senior notes issued in September 2015 compared to the previously outstanding 7.125% Notes. See Note 10, Debt, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's debt transactions.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment. In connection with the redemption of our 7.125% Notes, we incurred a pre-tax charge for early extinguishment of debt of approximately $16.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This charge is comprised of: (i) $4.9 million for the present value of the interest payments for the period from the redemption date of October 15, 2015 through January 15, 2016, (ii) $6.5 million for the excess of the present value of the redemption price over the carrying value of the 7.125% Notes, and (iii) $4.9 million for the write-off of deferred financing charges related to the fees incurred in connection with the issuance of the 7.125% Notes.\nOther Income, Net. Other income was $10.4 million and $8.3 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in other income, net is primarily a function of the number of assets sold and prices obtained for those assets during fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015. Other income, net during fiscal 2016 also includes immaterial discount fees related to a customer-sponsored vendor payment program in which we participate. Under this program, accounts receivable are collected on an expedited basis pursuant to a non-recourse sale of the receivables to a bank partner of the customer. The program significantly reduces the time required to collect that customer's receivables.\nIncome Taxes. The following table presents our income tax provision and effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFluctuations in our effective income tax rate were primarily attributable to the difference in income tax rates from state to state, non-deductible and non-taxable items, disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock option exercises, and production-related tax deductions recognized in relation to our pre-tax results during the periods. The decrease in our effective income tax rate during the current year period, as compared to the prior year period, is primarily due to increased production-related tax deductions recognized in relation to higher pre-tax results in the current period and a lesser impact of non-deductible items. We had total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $2.4 million and $2.3 million as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, respectively, which, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.\nNet Income. Net income was $128.7 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $84.3 million for fiscal 2015.\nYear Ended July 25, 2015 Compared to Year Ended July 26, 2014\nRevenues. Revenues increased to $2.022 billion during fiscal 2015 from $1.812 billion during fiscal 2014. Revenues increased in fiscal 2015 from services for customers deploying 1-gigabit networks and from new awards with significant customers. Additionally, work performed during fiscal 2015 was significantly less impacted by weather conditions as compared to fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2015, total revenues of $40.4 million were generated by businesses acquired during fiscal 2015 as well as during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014, total revenues of $2.8 million were generated by businesses acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Excluding amounts from these businesses that were not owned for the full year in both fiscal years, revenues increased by approximately $173.1 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Revenues increased for a significant customer investing in improvements to its networks by approximately $56.3 million. Revenues also increased for services performed on a customer's fiber network by approximately $55.1 million. In addition, revenues increased for a leading cable multiple system operator by approximately $48.2 million from maintenance and construction services, including services to provision fiber to small and medium businesses as well as network improvements. Other increases in revenue include increases of approximately $39.9 million for a customer for which we are performing fiber construction services on their end customer's network and increases of approximately $24.0 million for a large telecommunications customer investing in improvements to its network. Partially offsetting these increases, revenues related to stimulus work on projects funded in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 declined by approximately $61.4 million during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014, as the program was completed. Furthermore, revenues for a cable multiple system operator declined $17.9 million. All other customers, on a combined basis, had net increases in revenues of $28.9 million during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014.\nThe percentage of our revenue by customer type from telecommunications, underground facility locating, and electric and gas utilities and other customers, was approximately 90.0%, 6.2%, and 3.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2015, compared to 88.2%, 7.0% and 4.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2014.\nCosts of Earned Revenues. Costs of earned revenues increased to $1.593 billion during fiscal 2015, compared to $1.475 billion during fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to a higher level of operations during fiscal 2015, including the operating costs of businesses acquired during fiscal 2015 and 2014. The primary components of the increase were a $102.4 million aggregate increase in direct labor and subcontractor costs, $16.1 million increase in direct material costs, and $8.8 million increase in other direct costs, including insurance claim expense. These increases were partially offset by a $9.1 million aggregate decrease from lower fuel consumption and lower fuel prices during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014.\nCosts of earned revenues as a percentage of contract revenue decreased 2.6% during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was partially due to higher productivity resulting from the mix of work performed and better weather conditions during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2015, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2014. Adverse weather conditions during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2014 negatively impacted productivity and margins during those periods. Labor and subcontractor costs represented a lower percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2015 and decreased 1.0% as a percentage of\ncontract revenue, compared to fiscal 2014, as a result of improved operating efficiency based on the mix of work performed. In addition, costs decreased 0.7% from lower fuel consumption and lower fuel prices. Direct material costs decreased 0.2% as a percentage of contract revenue and other direct costs decreased 0.7% as a percentage of contract revenue, compared to fiscal 2014, as a result of improved operating leverage on our increased level of operations.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $178.7 million, or 8.8% as a percentage of contract revenue, during fiscal 2015, compared to $161.9 million, or 8.9% as a percentage of contract revenue, during fiscal 2014. The increase in total general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2015 resulted from increased payroll and performance-based compensation costs, higher legal and other professional fees, and the costs of businesses acquired in fiscal 2015 and 2014. Additionally, stock-based compensation increased to $13.9 million during fiscal 2015, from $12.6 million during fiscal 2014. Stock-based compensation recognized in fiscal 2014 for Performance RSUs was lower than fiscal 2015 because the Company did not fully achieve the performance goals set forth for the fiscal 2014 performance period.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased to $96.0 million during fiscal 2015, from $92.8 million during fiscal 2014, and totaled 4.7% and 5.1% of contract revenue, respectively. The increase in depreciation expense, arising from the addition of fixed assets during fiscal 2015 and depreciation from businesses acquired in fiscal 2015 and 2014, was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense. Amortization expense decreased to $16.7 million during fiscal 2015 from $18.3 million during fiscal 2014. The decrease in amortization expense was a result of certain contract backlog intangible assets of the telecommunications infrastructure services subsidiaries acquired from Quanta Services, Inc. becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net was $27.0 million and $26.8 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase for fiscal 2015 reflects higher debt balances outstanding for a longer time period during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The additional cost on incremental debt was partially offset by lower interest rates on the outstanding balances as a result of the amendment of our credit agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net was $8.3 million and $11.2 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in other income was primarily a function of the number of assets sold and prices obtained for those assets during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014.\nIncome Taxes.
