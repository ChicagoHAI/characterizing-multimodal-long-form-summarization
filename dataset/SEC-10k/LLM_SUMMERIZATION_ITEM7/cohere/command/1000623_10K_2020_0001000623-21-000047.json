Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the selected financial data included in Part II, Item 6, \"Selected Financial Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes various forward-looking statements about our markets, the demand for our products and our future prospects. These statements are based on certain assumptions that we consider reasonable. For information about risks and exposures relating to us and our business, you should read the sections entitled \"Factors That May Affect Future Results,\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and \"Forward Looking Statements\" at the end of this Item 7. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to \"SWM,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" or similar terms include Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with an understanding of our recent performance, our financial condition and our prospects. The following will be discussed and analyzed:\n\u2022 SUMMARY;\n\u2022 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES;\n\u2022 RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS;\n\u2022 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS;\n\u2022 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES;\n\u2022 OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES;\n\u2022 OUTLOOK; and\n\u2022 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\nCOVID-19 Overview\nAs a result of global economic and social disruption caused by the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d), the Company's sales, manufacturing operations, profitability, and cash flow have been, and may continue to be, impacted. This is an uncertain period with events and circumstances changing frequently, and while senior management is meeting regularly to address all aspects of the pandemic, the magnitude and duration of economic disruption is difficult to predict. This overview is intended to provide management's view of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the Company in 2020 and projected future impacts to assist investors in understanding these developments. These comments contain forward looking statements about operations, financial performance and liquidity, and are current as of December 31, 2020. Further details about the risks and impacts discussed in the section below can be found in the forward-looking statements and Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\".\nHealth and Safety. We maintain a primary commitment to the health of our global teams. As such, the Company has reviewed and modified our standard operating procedures to reflect the increased needs from the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to reassess our safety practices as developments occur and new information becomes available. We have reviewed all work responsibilities and those employees who are able have been encouraged to work remotely. At operating sites, we have increased our health and safety protocols. These protocols include a stepped-up focus and employee education on hygiene and sterilization procedures. We have implemented social distancing requirements and staggered schedules where appropriate. We have also increased guidelines for all employees on how to safely handle potential infections, including temperature checks prior to entering the site and self-quarantine/return to work requirements.\nEnd-markets and sales. SWM serves a variety of end-markets around the world, each with unique demand dynamics. Management believes many of the Company's end-markets have been and will remain relatively insulated from COVID-19-related economic challenges; however, some end-markets have been negatively affected by decreased demand, particularly transportation. In addition, sales results in 2020 have, and may continue to demonstrate, some volatility from potential inventory builds as customers manage inventories and safety stocks to protect against future potential supply chain disruptions.\nTobacco (EP) - The Company's largest single end-market is the tobacco industry, which has not been materially affected by the pandemic, given the consumer staple nature of the industry. The company believes some customers have increased their inventory levels to minimize supply chain impacts of potential future COVID-19 related disruptions.\nMedical (AMS) - The Company's medical products are largely used in finger bandages, diagnostic test strips, and hospital-setting products, and management believes sales of these products are not sensitive to COVID-19-related economic weakness.\nFiltration (AMS) - The Company serves water and other filtration markets, and management believes these products are generally less sensitive to economic volatility than typical industrial goods. Air filtration products have seen accelerated demand in 2020 due to heightened focus on air quality and attempts to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\nTransportation (AMS) - The Company's primary products are aftermarket automotive paint protection films, which management believes can deliver steady long-term growth due to increasing global consumer adoption of these products. In 2020, however, this category faced pronounced temporary near-term negative impacts, beginning late in the first quarter through most of the third quarter, as a result of significant auto industry disruption and consumer purchasing behaviors as a result of COVID-19. However, late in the third quarter of and throughout the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company's transportation sales began to improve significantly.\nInfrastructure & Construction (AMS) - The Company's key products service highway development, residential construction, oil and gas site services and various other industrial projects which must move soil and require erosion and sediment control. Management believes these end-markets have been impacted by local self-distancing regulations that may affect the construction industry, but these end markets could be positively supported by a potential increase in infrastructure spending if governments provide stimulus funding to reinvigorate economic activities.\nIndustrial (AMS & EP) - The Company's products service a broad range of applications, some of which are considered to be sensitive to economic activity and associated impacts of COVID-19, while other applications have delivered growth in 2020.\nManufacturing & Operations. Beyond the potential general demand impacts described above, the Company's operations have been moderately affected by external supply chain and customer-driven disruptions as well as within the Company's manufacturing footprint. During the initial onset of the epidemic, the Company temporarily shut down manufacturing operations and/or total operations at certain sites to implement enhanced safety and hygiene procedures or to respond to temporary government orders. Where possible, the Company continued to ship products from inventories on hand, and the financial impact of these disruptions did not have a material impact on the Company's full year results. At present, all facilities are operational. Furthermore, there have been only isolated and temporary customer shutdowns, and the Company is maintaining active dialogue with all key customers and suppliers regarding supply chain and production planning. The Company's primary raw materials remain readily available in the global marketplace and no significant procurement challenges have risen. Many of the Company's products in our AMS segment have been deemed essential\u201d (e.g., filtration and medical) by local governments and thus the production facilities are not expected to have further shutdowns unless local governments mandate temporary closure or there are additional health and safety concerns beyond the current circumstances.\nFinancial Results Impacts & Outlook. During the first quarter, the Company generally performed above internal expectations despite moderate COVID-19 related impacts, the most significant of which was the reduced sales of transportation films sold into China. However early signs of additional COVID-19 demand disruption led to the Company withdrawing its 2020 financial guidance in May in an abundance of caution (please refer to first quarter 2020 earnings press release and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 6, 2020 for additional commentary). During the second and third quarters, the Company's results, primarily in the AMS segment, were impacted due to softer demand in several regions as a result of decreased customer ordering beginning in March 2020 when the pandemic\nimpact spread globally and cases dramatically increased. Subsequently, the Company saw strong sales growth in the fourth quarter as certain key AMS end-markets such as transportation, filtration, and infrastructure and construction showed strong growth. For the full year, the company remained profitable and generated operating cash flow slightly higher than 2019 levels.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company conducted extensive sensitivity analyses on the potential 2020 financial impacts, particularly on cash flow and liquidity. These sensitivity tests included a range of outcomes from demand-only disruption, to multi-week shutdowns across our manufacturing footprint with all sales, production, and shipping halted. Given the recent financial results, coupled with management's belief that a meaningful escalation of manufacturing disruptions is unlikely, the Company's operating cash flows, cash on hand, and credit facility availability, are expected to provide ample liquidity to support the Company's operating needs and financial obligations, including cash dividend to stockholders.\nThe Company also continues to actively assess the credit worthiness of its customers in the context of the potential business disruptions from COVID-19 but has not yet seen evidence of a material change to its ability to collect accounts receivable balances.\nLiquidity & Debt Overview. The Company had $593.3 million of total debt, $54.7 million of cash, and undrawn capacity on its revolving credit facility of $445.0 million at the end of 2020. Net leverage was 2.3x at the end of 2020, versus a maximum covenant ratio of 4.5x per the terms of the credit facility, though covenants contain an acquisition-related provision, allowing net leverage to reach 5.0x throughout 2020. The Company's nearest debt maturity is the revolving credit facility which is due in 2023. Please refer to liquidity and capital resources section for additional detail.\nSUMMARY\nIn 2020, SWM reported net income of $83.8 million on total net sales of $1,074.4 million. Compared to the prior year, net sales increased $51.6 million, due primarily to incremental sales from the March 2020 Tekra acquisition of $77.3 million. The acquisition growth was offset by low single-digit sales declines in EP and AMS (excluding Tekra). Within AMS (excluding Tekra), Medical sales were up double-digits, while Filtration and Industrial sales were up modestly. Transportation and Infrastructure and Construction each declined, as they were more impacted by COVID-19 related demand disruptions, though each grew during the fourth quarter, with particularly strong growth in transportation.\nNet income decreased to $83.8 million in 2020 compared to $85.8 million in 2019. Outside of typical business drivers, several large one-time items affect the year-over-year comparison. In 2020, the most significant expense included $11.7 million of restructuring, impairment, and other expenses related to the shut-down of the Spotswood, New Jersey facility. In 2019, these one-time items included $6.6 million (after- tax) of expenses related to Brazil tax assessments.\nCash provided by operations was $161.6 million in 2020 up from $160.3 million in 2019. Other uses and proceeds of cash during 2020 included $169.3 million consideration to acquire Tekra, $47.4 million net in proceeds from long debt issuances and repayments, $55.0 million in cash dividends paid to SWM stockholders and $33.3 million of capital spending including capitalized software.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe disclose those accounting policies that we consider to be significant in determining the amounts to be utilized for communicating our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the first note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities reported and disclosure of contingencies. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the estimates and judgments made for each of the following items and our accounting for and presentation of these items in the accompanying financial statements:\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The complexity of our global structure requires technical expertise in determining the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions and consolidated income tax expense.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss).\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"), states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. We (1) record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and (2) adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted into law effective January 1, 2018. The new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected the Company, and include but are not limited to a one-time deemed repatriation tax on post-1986 accumulated earnings and profits of the foreign subsidiary undistributed earnings ( transition tax\u201d), a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a new deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (\"FDII\"), and a new provision designed to tax Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) of foreign subsidiaries effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the GILTI provision, the FASB issued Staff Q&A Topic 740, No. 5 Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income\u201d requiring an entity to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense only. We have elected to account for GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. Management makes certain judgments in interpreting the manner in which complex key provisions of the Tax Act should be applied and in the determination of income tax expense and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe have two main sources of revenue: product sales and materials conversion. We recognize product sales revenues when control of a product is transferred to the customer. For the majority of product sales, transfer of control occurs when the products are shipped from one of our manufacturing facilities to the customer. The cost of delivering finished goods to our customers is recorded as a component of cost of products sold. Those costs include the amounts paid to a third party to deliver the finished goods. Any freight costs billed to and paid by a customer are included in net sales. We also provide services to customers through the conversion of customer-owned raw materials into processed finished goods. In these transactions, we generally recognize revenue as processing is completed.\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied, which generally occurs when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Generally, we consider collectability of amounts due under a contract to be probable upon inception of a sale based on an evaluation of the credit worthiness of each customer. If collectability is not considered to be probable, we defer recognition of revenue on satisfied performance obligations until the uncertainty is resolved. Any variable consideration, such as discounts or price concessions, is set forth in the terms of the contract at inception and is included in the assessment of the transaction price at the outset of the arrangement. The transaction price is allocated to the individual performance obligations due under the contract based on the relative stand-alone fair value of the performance obligations identified in the contract. We typically use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations.\nWe do not typically include extended payment terms or significant financing components in our contracts with customers. Certain product sales contracts may include cash-based incentives (volume rebates or credits), which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts at least quarterly based on the expected forecast quantities to be provided to customers and reduce revenues recognized accordingly. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense in the period incurred. We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. As a practical expedient, we treat shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the good transfers as fulfillment activities, and therefore, does not account for shipping and handling costs as a separate performance obligation.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nWe accrue an estimated loss by taking a charge to income when the likelihood that a future event, such as a legal proceeding, will result in a loss or the incurrence of a liability is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, and our cash flows.\nFor further information, please see \"Litigation\" in Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" and Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Valuation\nCertain of our manufacturing processes are capital intensive; as a result, we make substantial investments in property, plant and equipment which are recorded at cost. Net property, plant and equipment comprised 21% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Production machines and related equipment are not subject to substantial\ntechnological changes rendering them obsolete and are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of 10 to 20 years. When indications of impairment exist, we assess the likelihood of recovering the cost of long-lived assets based on our expectation of future profitability and undiscounted cash flow of the related asset group. These factors, along with management's plans with respect to the operations, are considered in assessing the recoverability of property, plant and equipment. Changes in management's estimates and plans could significantly impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of excess capacity in the tobacco-related papers industry and increased purchased material and operating costs experienced in the last several years, competitive selling prices for certain of our products are not sufficient to cover our costs with a reasonable margin. Such competitive pressures have resulted in downtime of certain paper machines and, in some cases, accelerated depreciation or impairment of certain equipment, and employee severance. We have also incurred restructuring costs in our AMS segment in pursuit of synergies from integrating our acquisitions. In recent years, we have restructured our operations to improve our competitiveness and profitability. As a result, we incurred significant charges related to asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and employee severances.\nManagement continues to evaluate how to operate our production facilities more effectively. Further restructuring actions are possible that might require additional impairments or accelerated depreciation of some equipment.\nBusiness Combinations\nAccounting for business combinations requires us to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed (\"net assets\") at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair values are based upon quoted market prices and widely accepted valuation techniques, which require significant estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill, based on new information obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of net assets acquired, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated financial statements. See Note 5. Business Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nInvestments in Equity Affiliates\nInvestments in companies which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence and that, in general, are at least 20 percent-owned by us, are stated at cost plus equity in undistributed net income. These investments are evaluated for impairment when warranted. An impairment loss would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary. In judging \"other than temporary,\" we consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the equity company investment has been less than the carrying amount, the near-term and longer-term operating and financial prospects of the equity company, and our longer-term intent of retaining the investment in the equity company. See Note 9. Joint Ventures, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGoodwill and Unamortized Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Fair value of a reporting unit is typically based upon estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or market-based comparables. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, then an analysis will be performed to\ncompare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. An impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount over its implied fair value. After an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis. The annual impairment tests performed on October 1, 2020 and 2019 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be indicated when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset are less than its carrying amount. An impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the fair value (based on discounted future cash flows) and the carrying amount of the asset. Estimated useful lives range from 10 to 23 years for customer relationships and 4 to 20 years for developed technology, patents and other intangible assets. Certain trade names are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not amortized. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment following a method similar to the impairment testing for Goodwill. Testing of these assets is performed annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. The annual impairment tests performed on October 1, 2020 and 2019 did not indicate any impairment of intangible assets.\nRECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a discussion regarding recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see \"Recently adopted Accounting Pronouncements\" included in Note 2.

The increase of $66.3 million or 13.9% included the benefit from the Tekra acquisition (closed March 13, 2020), and gains in medical, filtration, and industrial end-markets. Medical sales were driven by higher demand for facemask materials and specialty hospital products. Filtration sales increased slightly with strong air filtration growth offset by mild softness in other areas. Industrial sales grew due to gains in packaging films and materials for wind turbine manufacturing. Those increases were partially offset by declines in transportation and infrastructure and construction sales driven by COVID-19 related pressures, however both end-markets rebounded in the fourth quarter, particularly transportation, moderating the full year declines. Excluding Tekra, AMS sales declined 2.3%.\nThe EP segment net sales were $530.9 million for 2020 compared to $545.6 million during 2019. The decrease of $14.7 million, or 2.7%, was primarily the result of the volume decline due to the continued strategic de-emphasis of non-tobacco volumes and tobacco industry attrition, which offset positive price/mix impact benefiting from a higher mix of high-value cigarette, Heat-not-Burn, and battery separator papers and a smaller proportion of lower-margin non-tobacco volumes.\nGross Profit\n(dollars in millions)\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Net Sales </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,074.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,022.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold </td> <td>766.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>732.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>308.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>290.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $18.3 million, or 6.3%, to $308.3 million from $290.0 million in the prior year. AMS gross profit increased by $9.5 million, primarily due to the incremental gross profits from the acquired Tekra business and lower input costs partially offset by declines in transportation and infrastructure and construction sales. In the EP segment, gross profit increased by $8.9 million, primarily due to positive price/mix impacts, cost reduction initiatives, lower input costs, and favorable impact of foreign currency movements, partially offset by $4.9 million of other restructuring-related charges in Cost of products, of which $2.0 million was to write down the value of certain spare parts and consignment inventories to estimated net realizable\nvalue and $2.9 million, resulting from the acceleration of depreciation and amortization for machinery and equipment.\nThe $4.9 million of other restructuring-related charges related to the decision to shut down the Spotswood, New Jersey facility and shift the production of paper made there to the Company's other facilities.

$11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $8.2 million.\nIn the AMS segment, restructuring and impairment expense of $0.5 million in the 2020 period related to severance accruals as a result of department realignments.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, restructuring expense included $6.7 million in the EP segment relating to severance and other accruals as a result of the decision to shut down the Spotswood, New Jersey facility.\nThe EP segment also recognized $4.6 million of restructuring expenses in 2020 primarily related to severance accruals at our manufacturing operations in France and Poland. These restructuring charges relate to ongoing cost optimization initiatives to remain competitive within the EP segment.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, restructuring and impairment expenses consisted of $1.1 million in impairment charges at our U.S. and Chinese manufacturing facilities related to our AMS segment, as well as $2.6 million in severance accruals for employees at our U.S., Brazilian and French manufacturing operations related to the EP segment.\nOperating Profit\n(dollars in millions)\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Return on Net Sales </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advanced Materials & Structures </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Engineered Papers </td> <td>116.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated expenses </td> <td>(52.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating profit was $128.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $134.0 million during the prior year.\nThe AMS segment's operating profit in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $64.8 million compared to $64.3 million in the prior year period, up 1%, which reflected incremental operating profits from the Tekra acquisition partially offset by higher purchase accounting expenses related to the Tekra acquisition.\nThe EP segment's operating profit in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $116.8 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 2.0%, from $119.2 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to $16.2 million of restructuring and impairment expenses and other restructuring related charges of which $11.7 million was related to the shut-down of the Spotswood, New Jersey facility as discussed above, partially offset by positive price/mix impacts, cost structure improvements, lower raw material costs and favorable currency movements mostly from lower local currency operating costs in Brazil.\nUnallocated expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020 were $52.8 million, up $3.3 million, or 6.7%, from the $49.5 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the result of transaction expenses associated with the Tekra acquisition, and third-party consulting costs.\nNon-Operating Expenses, Net\nInterest expense was $30.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $5.6 million from $36.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due mainly to $7.1 million of non-recurring interest expense related to Brazil tax assessments in the year of 2019. Interest expense on debt was up $1.5 million primarily due to incremental debt related to the Tekra acquisition.\nThe weighted average effective interest rate on our debt facilities was approximately 4.02% and 4.42% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOther expense, net was $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 unchanged versus the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nAn $18.4 million and $15.2 million provision for income taxes in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulted in an effective tax rate of 18.9% compared with 15.7% in the prior year. The Company's effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% due to varying tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions and a year over year $4.2 million reduction due to the one-time Brazil ICMS litigation accrual in 2019.\nIncome (Loss) from Equity Affiliates\nIncome from equity affiliates, net of income taxes, was $4.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with income of $4.1 million during the prior year, and reflects the results of operations of CTM and CTS.\nNet Income and Income per Share\nNet income in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $83.8 million, or $2.66 per diluted share, compared with $85.8 million, or $2.76 per diluted share, during the prior year period.\nFor a comparison of the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2020.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nA major factor in our liquidity and capital resource planning is our generation of cash flow from operations, which is sensitive to changes in the mix of products sold, volume and pricing of our products, as well as changes in our production volumes, costs and working capital. Our liquidity is supplemented by funds available under our revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that is used as either operating conditions or strategic opportunities warrant.\nCash Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2020, $39.4 million of our $54.7 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital, including cash on-hand, cash generated from operations and our existing credit facilities, will be sufficient to finance our continued operations and growth strategy.\nWe generally fund our capital projects using cash on-hand, cash generated from operations and our existing credit facilities, including the Credit Agreement, as defined below in \"Debt Instruments and Related Covenants.\"\nCash Provided by Operations\nNet cash provided by operations was $161.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $160.3 million in the prior year.\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net operating working capital of $232.3 million including cash and cash equivalents of $54.7 million, compared with net operating working capital of $271.8 million including cash and cash equivalents of $103.0 million as of December 31, 2019. These changes primarily reflect the impact of the Tekra acquisition and increases in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nIn 2020, net changes in operating working capital decreased cash flow by $5.7 million. In 2019, net changes in operating working capital decreased cash flow by $1.8 million. The most significant working capital related cash outflow item was related to higher accounts receivable, as a result of strong Q4 organic sales.\nCash Used for Investing\nCash used for investing activities during 2020 was $203.1 million and consisted primarily of the net $169.3 million consideration to acquire Tekra. Capital spending including capitalized software totaled $33.3 million, down $0.8 million. In response to COVID-19 related impacts to certain end-markets, management continues to monitor cash flow trends and has deferred some discretionary capital spending originally planned for 2020.\nCash used for investing activities during 2019 was $14.8 million and consisted primarily of cash paid for capital spending partially offset by proceeds from the sale of RTL Philippines assets.\nCapital Spending\nCapital spending including capitalized software was $33.3 million, and $34.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020 and 2019 capital spending was primarily related to support growth in filtration and transportation on AMS manufacturing facilities in China, the development of new products, the rebuild of certain paper manufacturing lines, and IT infrastructure.\nWe incur capital spending as necessary to meet legal requirements and otherwise in connection with the protection of the environment at our facilities in the U.S., United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China and Poland. For these purposes, we expect to incur capital expenditures of less than $1.0 million in each of 2021 and 2022, of which no material amount is expected to be the result of environmental fines or settlements. The foregoing capital expenditures are not expected to reduce our ability to invest in other appropriate and necessary capital projects and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCash Used for Financing Activities\nDuring 2020, financing activities consisted primarily of $212.7 million proceeds from borrowings under the revolving credit facility, primarily to fund the Tekra acquisition, net repayments on borrowings of $165.3 million, cash dividends of $55.0 million paid to SWM stockholders and share repurchases of $1.0 million.\nDuring 2019, financing activities consisted primarily of net repayments on borrowings of $80.5 million, cash dividends of $54.4 million paid to SWM stockholders and share repurchases of $0.9 million.\nDividend Payments\nWe have declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock every fiscal quarter since the second quarter of 1996. On February 18, 2021, we announced a cash dividend of $0.44 per share payable on March 26, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 12, 2021. The covenants contained in our Indenture and Credit Agreement, each, as defined below in \"Debt Instruments and Related Covenants,\" require that we maintain certain financial ratios, as disclosed in Note 14. Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, none of which under normal business conditions materially limit our ability to pay such dividends. We will continue to assess our dividend policy in light of our overall strategy, cash generation, debt levels and ongoing requirements for cash to fund operations and to pursue possible strategic opportunities.\nShare Repurchases\nIn 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 27,779 shares and 25,297 shares, respectively, of our common stock at a cost of $1.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively, for the value of employees' stock-based compensation share awards surrendered to satisfy their personal statutory income tax withholding obligations.\nDebt Instruments and Related Covenants\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Instruments and Related Covenants ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in short-term debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from issuances of long-term debt </td> <td>212.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments on long-term debt </td> <td>(165.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(99.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net proceeds (repayments) from borrowings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(80.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet proceeds from borrowings were $47.4 million during 2020.\nOn February 10, 2021 we amended our existing Credit Agreement to provide for an additional Term Loan Facility Term Loan B\u201d which provides for additional capacity of $350 million.

Other than potential borrowings under the Term Loan B, the Company does not expect to incur any significant additional borrowings during 2021.\nCredit Agreement\nOn September 25, 2018, the Company entered into a $700.0 million credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which replaced the Company's previous senior secured credit facilities and provides for a five-year $500.0 million revolving line of credit (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a seven-year $200.0 million bank term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d). Subject to certain conditions, including the absence of a default or event of default under the Credit Agreement, the Company may request incremental loans to be extended under the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility so long as the Company is in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement and the aggregate of such increases does not exceed $400.0 million. See Note 14. Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (i) 1.75% in excess of a reserve adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or (ii) 0.75% in excess of an alternative base rate. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will initially bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (i) 2.00% in excess of a reserve adjusted LIBOR rate or (ii) 1.00% in excess of an alternative base rate. The Term Loan amortizes at the rate of 1.0% per year and will mature on September 25, 2025. Unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement was $445.0 million as of December 31, 2020. We also had availability under our bank overdraft facilities and lines of credit of $6.7 million as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the Indenture and Credit Agreement at December 31, 2020. With the current level of borrowing and forecasted results, we expect to remain in compliance with our Credit Agreement financial covenants.\nOur total debt to capital ratios, as calculated under the Credit Agreement, at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were 47.7% and 47.6%, respectively.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn September 25, 2018, the Company closed a private offering of $350.0 million of 6.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company's existing and future wholly-owned subsidiaries that is a borrower under or that guarantees obligations under the Credit Agreement, as defined below, or that guarantees certain other indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the Indenture\u201d), dated as of September 25, 2018, by and among the Company, the guarantors listed therein and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that interest on the Notes will accrue from September 25, 2018 and is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2019, and the Notes mature on October 1, 2026.\nThe Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time on or after October 1, 2021, at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Prior to October 1, 2021, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole\u201d premium as set forth in the Indenture. The Company may redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes on or prior to October 1, 2021 with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106.875% of the principal amount of the Notes. If the Company sells certain assets or consummates certain change of control transactions, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes, subject to certain conditions.\nFor a comparison of liquidity and capital resources and the Company's cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nOTHER FACTORS AFFECTING LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table represents our future contractual cash requirements for the next five years and thereafter for our long-term debt obligations and other commitments ($ in millions):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments due for the years ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current debt (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (2)\n</td> <td>593.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>344.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt interest (3)\n</td> <td>160.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring obligations (4)\n</td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum operating lease\npayments (5)\n</td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations -

Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(2) Long-term debt excludes debt issuance costs of $3.3 million and $6.1 million in unamortized discount on the senior unsecured notes; see additional information regarding long-term debt in Note 14. Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(3) The amounts reflected in debt interest are based upon the short-term and long-term scheduled principal maturities and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2020. Where specific maturities are not stated, such as for an overdraft line-of-credit, a repayment date coinciding with the end of the year was used for purposes of these calculations. With respect to our variable-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2020, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our debt interest obligation by $4.4 million in 2021, taking into account the effect of the interest rate hedge transactions the Company has entered into as of December 31, 2020. For more information regarding our outstanding debt and associated interest rates, as well as hedging strategies in place which serve to fix the interest rate on a large portion of our debt, see Note 14. Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(4) Restructuring obligations are more fully discussed in Note 13. Restructuring and Impairment Activities, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(5) Minimum operating lease payments relate to our future minimum obligations under non-cancelable operating leases having an initial or remaining term in excess of one year as of December 31, 2020.\n(6) Purchase obligations for raw materials include our calcium carbonate purchase agreement at our plant in Quimperl\u00e9, France, in which a vendor operates an on-site calcium carbonate plant and our plant has minimum purchase quantities. See Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(7) Purchase obligations for energy include obligations under agreements with (1) an energy co-generation supplier at our plants in Quimperl\u00e9, France and Spay, France, to supply steam for which our plants have minimum purchase commitments, (2) a natural gas supplier to supply and distribute 100% of the natural gas needs of our three French plants, (3) an electricity supplier to supply and distribute the electricity needs of our three French plants, (4) an energy supplier to supply a constant supply of electricity for our Pirahy plant in Brazil, (5) an energy supplier to supply natural gas for our Pirahy plant in Brazil and (6) an energy supplier has a contract to provide biomass at our Spay, France facility for the next two years. See Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(8) On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Act into law, which requires a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Companies may elect to pay the tax over eight years based on an installment schedule outlined in the Tax Act. We have made this election and have reflected our transition tax due by year as a contractual obligation. See Note. 17. Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(9) Other contractual obligations relate to commitments for capital projects. Other contractual obligations exclude $2.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions for which there is no contractual obligation. We had no other long-term liabilities as defined for purposes of this disclosure by the SEC as of December 31, 2020.\n(10) Other contractual obligations do not include any amounts for our pension obligations. The pension obligations are funded by our separate pension trusts, which held $135.2 million in assets at December 31, 2020. The combined projected benefit obligation (\"PBO\") of our U.S. and French pension plans was underfunded by $25.7 million and $24.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We make contributions to our pension trusts based on many factors including regulatory guidelines, investment returns of the trusts and availability of cash for pension contributions versus other priorities. We expect 2020 funding to be in compliance with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. For information regarding our long-term pension obligations and trust assets, see Note 18. Postretirement and Other Benefits, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(11) Other contractual obligations do not include any amounts for our postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits. Such payments are dependent upon our retirees incurring costs and filing claims; therefore, future payments are uncertain. Our net payments under these plans were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Based on this past experience, we currently expect our share of the net payments during 2021 to be insignificant.\nOUTLOOK\nFor the AMS segment, we expect our growth outlook to be driven by macro factors affecting our served end-markets, including filtration, transportation, infrastructure and construction, medical, and industrial, as well as industry demand for many of our key applications. We expect water and other specialty filtration applications, surface protection products within transportation, and our products for infrastructure and construction end-markets to deliver growth exceeding GDP, or other global growth benchmarks, over the long-term due to the relative strong demand for the specific products we provide. Generally, we believe that our sales into the industrial and medical end-markets will perform relatively in line with long-term broad economic growth in the U.S. and to some extent Europe and China. However, the Company's medical sales demonstrated strong growth in 2020, and could continue to outpace the broader economy, due to increased demand for certain products related to COVID-19. Excluding potential impacts from raw material price movements, the Company generally projects profit growth in the AMS segment as a result of expected organic sales growth. For the EP segment, we expect our performance to be driven by macro factors, such as the expected long-term trend of reduced cigarette consumption and foreign exchange movements, and the potential regulatory changes in the tobacco industry such as approvals of various new reduced-risk tobacco products or tax-related price increases.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to the safe harbor created by that Act and other legal protections.

This is an uncertain period with events and circumstances changing frequently, and while senior management is meeting regularly to address all aspects of the pandemic, the magnitude and duration of economic disruption is difficult to predict. This overview is intended to provide management's view of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the Company in 2020 and projected future impacts to assist investors in understanding these developments. These comments contain forward looking statements about operations, financial performance and liquidity, and are current as of December 31, 2020. Further details about the risks and impacts discussed in the section below can be found in the forward-looking statements and Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\".\nHealth and Safety. We maintain a primary commitment to the health of our global teams. As such, the Company has reviewed and modified our standard operating procedures to reflect the increased needs from the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to reassess our safety practices as developments occur and new information becomes available. We have reviewed all work responsibilities and those employees who are able have been encouraged to work remotely. At operating sites, we have increased our health and safety protocols. These protocols include a stepped-up focus and employee education on hygiene and sterilization procedures. We have implemented social distancing requirements and staggered schedules where appropriate. We have also increased guidelines for all employees on how to safely handle potential infections, including temperature checks prior to entering the site and self-quarantine/return to work requirements.\nEnd-markets and sales. SWM serves a variety of end-markets around the world, each with unique demand dynamics. Management believes many of the Company's end-markets have been and will remain relatively insulated from COVID-19-related economic challenges; however, some end-markets have been negatively affected by decreased demand, particularly transportation. In addition, sales results in 2020 have, and may continue to demonstrate, some volatility from potential inventory builds as customers manage inventories and safety stocks to protect against future potential supply chain disruptions.\nTobacco (EP) - The Company's largest single end-market is the tobacco industry, which has not been materially affected by the pandemic, given the consumer staple nature of the industry. The company believes some customers have increased their inventory levels to minimize supply chain impacts of potential future COVID-19 related disruptions.\nMedical (AMS) - The Company's medical products are largely used in finger bandages, diagnostic test strips, and hospital-setting products, and management believes sales of these products are not sensitive to COVID-19-related economic weakness.\nFiltration (AMS) - The Company serves water and other filtration markets, and management believes these products are generally less sensitive to economic volatility than typical industrial goods. Air filtration products have seen accelerated demand in 2020 due to heightened focus on air quality and attempts to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\nTransportation (AMS) - The Company's primary products are aftermarket automotive paint protection films, which management believes can deliver steady long-term growth due to increasing global consumer adoption of these products. In 2020, however, this category faced pronounced temporary near-term negative impacts, beginning late in the first quarter through most of the third quarter, as a result of significant auto industry disruption and consumer purchasing behaviors as a result of COVID-19. However, late in the third quarter of and throughout the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company's transportation sales began to improve significantly.\nInfrastructure & Construction (AMS) - The Company's key products service highway development, residential construction, oil and gas site services and various other industrial projects which must move soil and require erosion and sediment control. Management believes these end-markets have been impacted by local self-distancing regulations that may affect the construction industry, but these end markets could be positively supported by a potential increase in infrastructure spending if governments provide stimulus funding to reinvigorate economic activities.\nIndustrial (AMS & EP) - The Company's products service a broad range of applications, some of which are considered to be sensitive to economic activity and associated impacts of COVID-19, while other applications have delivered growth in 2020.\nManufacturing & Operations. Beyond the potential general demand impacts described above, the Company's operations have been moderately affected by external supply chain and customer-driven disruptions as well as within the Company's manufacturing footprint. During the initial onset of the epidemic, the Company temporarily shut down manufacturing operations and/or total operations at certain sites to implement enhanced safety and hygiene procedures or to respond to temporary government orders. Where possible, the Company continued to ship products from inventories on hand, and the financial impact of these disruptions did not have a material impact on the Company's full year results. At present, all facilities are operational. Furthermore, there have been only isolated and temporary customer shutdowns, and the Company is maintaining active dialogue with all key customers and suppliers regarding supply chain and production planning. The Company's primary raw materials remain readily available in the global marketplace and no significant procurement challenges have risen. Many of the Company's products in our AMS segment have been deemed essential\u201d (e.g., filtration and medical) by local governments and thus the production facilities are not expected to have further shutdowns unless local governments mandate temporary closure or there are additional health and safety concerns beyond the current circumstances.\nFinancial Results Impacts & Outlook. During the first quarter, the Company generally performed above internal expectations despite moderate COVID-19 related impacts, the most significant of which was the reduced sales of transportation films sold into China. However early signs of additional COVID-19 demand disruption led to the Company withdrawing its 2020 financial guidance in May in an abundance of caution (please refer to first quarter 2020 earnings press release and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 6, 2020 for additional commentary). During the second and third quarters, the Company's results, primarily in the AMS segment, were impacted due to softer demand in several regions as a result of decreased customer ordering beginning in March 2020 when the pandemic\nimpact spread globally and cases dramatically increased. Subsequently, the Company saw strong sales growth in the fourth quarter as certain key AMS end-markets such as transportation, filtration, and infrastructure and construction showed strong growth. For the full year, the company remained profitable and generated operating cash flow slightly higher than 2019 levels.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company conducted extensive sensitivity analyses on the potential 2020 financial impacts, particularly on cash flow and liquidity. These sensitivity tests included a range of outcomes from demand-only disruption, to multi-week shutdowns across our manufacturing footprint with all sales, production, and shipping halted. Given the recent financial results, coupled with management's belief that a meaningful escalation of manufacturing disruptions is unlikely, the Company's operating cash flows, cash on hand, and credit facility availability, are expected to provide ample liquidity to support the Company's operating needs and financial obligations, including cash dividend to stockholders.\nThe Company also continues to actively assess the credit worthiness of its customers in the context of the potential business disruptions from COVID-19 but has not yet seen evidence of a material change to its ability to collect accounts receivable balances.\nLiquidity & Debt Overview. The Company had $593.3 million of total debt, $54.7 million of cash, and undrawn capacity on its revolving credit facility of $445.0 million at the end of 2020. Net leverage was 2.3x at the end of 2020, versus a maximum covenant ratio of 4.5x per the terms of the credit facility, though covenants contain an acquisition-related provision, allowing net leverage to reach 5.0x throughout 2020. The Company's nearest debt maturity is the revolving credit facility which is due in 2023. Please refer to liquidity and capital resources section for additional detail.\nSUMMARY\nIn 2020, SWM reported net income of $83.8 million on total net sales of $1,074.4 million. Compared to the prior year, net sales increased $51.6 million, due primarily to incremental sales from the March 2020 Tekra acquisition of $77.3 million. The acquisition growth was offset by low single-digit sales declines in EP and AMS (excluding Tekra). Within AMS (excluding Tekra), Medical sales were up double-digits, while Filtration and Industrial sales were up modestly. Transportation and Infrastructure and Construction each declined, as they were more impacted by COVID-19 related demand disruptions, though each grew during the fourth quarter, with particularly strong growth in transportation.\nNet income decreased to $83.8 million in 2020 compared to $85.8 million in 2019. Outside of typical business drivers, several large one-time items affect the year-over-year comparison. In 2020, the most significant expense included $11.7 million of restructuring, impairment, and other expenses related to the shut-down of the Spotswood, New Jersey facility. In 2019, these one-time items included $6.6 million (after- tax) of expenses related to Brazil tax assessments.\nCash provided by operations was $161.6 million in 2020 up from $160.3 million in 2019. Other uses and proceeds of cash during 2020 included $169.3 million consideration to acquire Tekra, $47.4 million net in proceeds from long debt issuances and repayments, $55.0 million in cash dividends paid to SWM stockholders and $33.3 million of capital spending including capitalized software.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe disclose those accounting policies that we consider to be significant in determining the amounts to be utilized for communicating our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the first note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities reported and disclosure of contingencies. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the estimates and judgments made for each of the following items and our accounting for and presentation of these items in the accompanying financial statements:\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The complexity of our global structure requires technical expertise in determining the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions and consolidated income tax expense.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss).\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"), states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. We (1) record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and (2) adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted into law effective January 1, 2018. The new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected the Company, and include but are not limited to a one-time deemed repatriation tax on post-1986 accumulated earnings and profits of the foreign subsidiary undistributed earnings ( transition tax\u201d), a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a new deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (\"FDII\"), and a new provision designed to tax Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) of foreign subsidiaries effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the GILTI provision, the FASB issued Staff Q&A Topic 740, No. 5 Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income\u201d requiring an entity to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense only. We have elected to account for GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. Management makes certain judgments in interpreting the manner in which complex key provisions of the Tax Act should be applied and in the determination of income tax expense and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe have two main sources of revenue: product sales and materials conversion. We recognize product sales revenues when control of a product is transferred to the customer. For the majority of product sales, transfer of control occurs when the products are shipped from one of our manufacturing facilities to the customer. The cost of delivering finished goods to our customers is recorded as a component of cost of products sold. Those costs include the amounts paid to a third party to deliver the finished goods. Any freight costs billed to and paid by a customer are included in net sales. We also provide services to customers through the conversion of customer-owned raw materials into processed finished goods. In these transactions, we generally recognize revenue as processing is completed.\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied, which generally occurs when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Generally, we consider collectability of amounts due under a contract to be probable upon inception of a sale based on an evaluation of the credit worthiness of each customer. If collectability is not considered to be probable, we defer recognition of revenue on satisfied performance obligations until the uncertainty is resolved. Any variable consideration, such as discounts or price concessions, is set forth in the terms of the contract at inception and is included in the assessment of the transaction price at the outset of the arrangement. The transaction price is allocated to the individual performance obligations due under the contract based on the relative stand-alone fair value of the performance obligations identified in the contract. We typically use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations.\nWe do not typically include extended payment terms or significant financing components in our contracts with customers. Certain product sales contracts may include cash-based incentives (volume rebates or credits), which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts at least quarterly based on the expected forecast quantities to be provided to customers and reduce revenues recognized accordingly. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense in the period incurred. We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. As a practical expedient, we treat shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the good transfers as fulfillment activities, and therefore, does not account for shipping and handling costs as a separate performance obligation.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nWe accrue an estimated loss by taking a charge to income when the likelihood that a future event, such as a legal proceeding, will result in a loss or the incurrence of a liability is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, and our cash flows.\nFor further information, please see \"Litigation\" in Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" and Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Valuation\nCertain of our manufacturing processes are capital intensive; as a result, we make substantial investments in property, plant and equipment which are recorded at cost. Net property, plant and equipment comprised 21% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Production machines and related equipment are not subject to substantial\ntechnological changes rendering them obsolete and are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of 10 to 20 years. When indications of impairment exist, we assess the likelihood of recovering the cost of long-lived assets based on our expectation of future profitability and undiscounted cash flow of the related asset group. These factors, along with management's plans with respect to the operations, are considered in assessing the recoverability of property, plant and equipment. Changes in management's estimates and plans could significantly impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of excess capacity in the tobacco-related papers industry and increased purchased material and operating costs experienced in the last several years, competitive selling prices for certain of our products are not sufficient to cover our costs with a reasonable margin. Such competitive pressures have resulted in downtime of certain paper machines and, in some cases, accelerated depreciation or impairment of certain equipment, and employee severance. We have also incurred restructuring costs in our AMS segment in pursuit of synergies from integrating our acquisitions. In recent years, we have restructured our operations to improve our competitiveness and profitability. As a result, we incurred significant charges related to asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and employee severances.\nManagement continues to evaluate how to operate our production facilities more effectively. Further restructuring actions are possible that might require additional impairments or accelerated depreciation of some equipment.\nBusiness Combinations\nAccounting for business combinations requires us to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed (\"net assets\") at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair values are based upon quoted market prices and widely accepted valuation techniques, which require significant estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill, based on new information obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of net assets acquired, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated financial statements. See Note 5. Business Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nInvestments in Equity Affiliates\nInvestments in companies which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence and that, in general, are at least 20 percent-owned by us, are stated at cost plus equity in undistributed net income. These investments are evaluated for impairment when warranted. An impairment loss would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary. In judging \"other than temporary,\" we consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the equity company investment has been less than the carrying amount, the near-term and longer-term operating and financial prospects of the equity company, and our longer-term intent of retaining the investment in the equity company. See Note 9. Joint Ventures, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGoodwill and Unamortized Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Fair value of a reporting unit is typically based upon estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or market-based comparables. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, then an analysis will be performed to\ncompare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. An impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount over its implied fair value. After an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis. The annual impairment tests performed on October 1, 2020 and 2019 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be indicated when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset are less than its carrying amount. An impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the fair value (based on discounted future cash flows) and the carrying amount of the asset. Estimated useful lives range from 10 to 23 years for customer relationships and 4 to 20 years for developed technology, patents and other intangible assets. Certain trade names are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not amortized. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment following a method similar to the impairment testing for Goodwill. Testing of these assets is performed annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. The annual impairment tests performed on October 1, 2020 and 2019 did not indicate any impairment of intangible assets.\nRECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a discussion regarding recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see \"Recently adopted Accounting Pronouncements\" included in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(1) Results during the year ended December 31, 2020 include Tekra from the March 13, 2020 acquisition date to December 31, 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNet Sales\n(dollars in millions)\n\nNet sales were $1,074.4 million in 2020 compared with $1,022.8 million in 2019. The increase in net sales consisted of the following (dollars in millions):\n\nAMS segment net sales were $543.5 million for 2020 compared to $477.2 million during 2019. The increase of $66.3 million or 13.9% included the benefit from the Tekra acquisition (closed March 13, 2020), and gains in medical, filtration, and industrial end-markets. Medical sales were driven by higher demand for facemask materials and specialty hospital products. Filtration sales increased slightly with strong air filtration growth offset by mild softness in other areas. Industrial sales grew due to gains in packaging films and materials for wind turbine manufacturing. Those increases were partially offset by declines in transportation and infrastructure and construction sales driven by COVID-19 related pressures, however both end-markets rebounded in the fourth quarter, particularly transportation, moderating the full year declines. Excluding Tekra, AMS sales declined 2.3%.\nThe EP segment net sales were $530.9 million for 2020 compared to $545.6 million during 2019. The decrease of $14.7 million, or 2.7%, was primarily the result of the volume decline due to the continued strategic de-emphasis of non-tobacco volumes and tobacco industry attrition, which offset positive price/mix impact benefiting from a higher mix of high-value cigarette, Heat-not-Burn, and battery separator papers and a smaller proportion of lower-margin non-tobacco volumes.\nGross Profit\n(dollars in millions)\n\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $18.3 million, or 6.3%, to $308.3 million from $290.0 million in the prior year. AMS gross profit increased by $9.5 million, primarily due to the incremental gross profits from the acquired Tekra business and lower input costs partially offset by declines in transportation and infrastructure and construction sales. In the EP segment, gross profit increased by $8.9 million, primarily due to positive price/mix impacts, cost reduction initiatives, lower input costs, and favorable impact of foreign currency movements, partially offset by $4.9 million of other restructuring-related charges in Cost of products, of which $2.0 million was to write down the value of certain spare parts and consignment inventories to estimated net realizable\nvalue and $2.9 million, resulting from the acceleration of depreciation and amortization for machinery and equipment.\nThe $4.9 million of other restructuring-related charges related to the decision to shut down the Spotswood, New Jersey facility and shift the production of paper made there to the Company's other facilities. See Note 13. Restructuring and Impairment Activities, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNonmanufacturing Expenses\n(dollars in millions)\n\nNonmanufacturing expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $15.3 million, or 10.0%, to $167.6 million from $152.3 million in the prior year due primarily to incremental expenses of the acquired Tekra business and transaction expenses associated with the Tekra acquisition, as well as third-party consulting expenses.\nRestructuring and Impairment Expense\n(dollars in millions)\n\nThe Company incurred total restructuring and impairment expense of $11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $8.2 million.\nIn the AMS segment, restructuring and impairment expense of $0.5 million in the 2020 period related to severance accruals as a result of department realignments.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, restructuring expense included $6.7 million in the EP segment relating to severance and other accruals as a result of the decision to shut down the Spotswood, New Jersey facility.\nThe EP segment also recognized $4.6 million of restructuring expenses in 2020 primarily related to severance accruals at our manufacturing operations in France and Poland. These restructuring charges relate to ongoing cost optimization initiatives to remain competitive within the EP segment.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, restructuring and impairment expenses consisted of $1.1 million in impairment charges at our U.S. and Chinese manufacturing facilities related to our AMS segment, as well as $2.6 million in severance accruals for employees at our U.S., Brazilian and French manufacturing operations related to the EP segment.\nOperating Profit\n(dollars in millions)\n\nOperating profit was $128.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $134.0 million during the prior year.\nThe AMS segment's operating profit in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $64.8 million compared to $64.3 million in the prior year period, up 1%, which reflected incremental operating profits from the Tekra acquisition partially offset by higher purchase accounting expenses related to the Tekra acquisition.\nThe EP segment's operating profit in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $116.8 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 2.0%, from $119.2 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to $16.2 million of restructuring and impairment expenses and other restructuring related charges of which $11.7 million was related to the shut-down of the Spotswood, New Jersey facility as discussed above, partially offset by positive price/mix impacts, cost structure improvements, lower raw material costs and favorable currency movements mostly from lower local currency operating costs in Brazil.\nUnallocated expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020 were $52.8 million, up $3.3 million, or 6.7%, from the $49.5 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the result of transaction expenses associated with the Tekra acquisition, and third-party consulting costs.\nNon-Operating Expenses, Net\nInterest expense was $30.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $5.6 million from $36.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due mainly to $7.1 million of non-recurring interest expense related to Brazil tax assessments in the year of 2019. Interest expense on debt was up $1.5 million primarily due to incremental debt related to the Tekra acquisition.\nThe weighted average effective interest rate on our debt facilities was approximately 4.02% and 4.42% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOther expense, net was $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 unchanged versus the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nAn $18.4 million and $15.2 million provision for income taxes in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulted in an effective tax rate of 18.9% compared with 15.7% in the prior year. The Company's effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% due to varying tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions and a year over year $4.2 million reduction due to the one-time Brazil ICMS litigation accrual in 2019.\nIncome (Loss) from Equity Affiliates\nIncome from equity affiliates, net of income taxes, was $4.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with income of $4.1 million during the prior year, and reflects the results of operations of CTM and CTS.\nNet Income and Income per Share\nNet income in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $83.8 million, or $2.66 per diluted share, compared with $85.8 million, or $2.76 per diluted share, during the prior year period.\nFor a comparison of the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2020.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nA major factor in our liquidity and capital resource planning is our generation of cash flow from operations, which is sensitive to changes in the mix of products sold, volume and pricing of our products, as well as changes in our production volumes, costs and working capital. Our liquidity is supplemented by funds available under our revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that is used as either operating conditions or strategic opportunities warrant.\nCash Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2020, $39.4 million of our $54.7 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital, including cash on-hand, cash generated from operations and our existing credit facilities, will be sufficient to finance our continued operations and growth strategy.\nWe generally fund our capital projects using cash on-hand, cash generated from operations and our existing credit facilities, including the Credit Agreement, as defined below in \"Debt Instruments and Related Covenants.\"\nCash Provided by Operations\nNet cash provided by operations was $161.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $160.3 million in the prior year.\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net operating working capital of $232.3 million including cash and cash equivalents of $54.7 million, compared with net operating working capital of $271.8 million including cash and cash equivalents of $103.0 million as of December 31, 2019. These changes primarily reflect the impact of the Tekra acquisition and increases in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nIn 2020, net changes in operating working capital decreased cash flow by $5.7 million. In 2019, net changes in operating working capital decreased cash flow by $1.8 million. The most significant working capital related cash outflow item was related to higher accounts receivable, as a result of strong Q4 organic sales.\nCash Used for Investing\nCash used for investing activities during 2020 was $203.1 million and consisted primarily of the net $169.3 million consideration to acquire Tekra. Capital spending including capitalized software totaled $33.3 million, down $0.8 million. In response to COVID-19 related impacts to certain end-markets, management continues to monitor cash flow trends and has deferred some discretionary capital spending originally planned for 2020.\nCash used for investing activities during 2019 was $14.8 million and consisted primarily of cash paid for capital spending partially offset by proceeds from the sale of RTL Philippines assets.\nCapital Spending\nCapital spending including capitalized software was $33.3 million, and $34.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020 and 2019 capital spending was primarily related to support growth in filtration and transportation on AMS manufacturing facilities in China, the development of new products, the rebuild of certain paper manufacturing lines, and IT infrastructure.\nWe incur capital spending as necessary to meet legal requirements and otherwise in connection with the protection of the environment at our facilities in the U.S., United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China and Poland. For these purposes, we expect to incur capital expenditures of less than $1.0 million in each of 2021 and 2022, of which no material amount is expected to be the result of environmental fines or settlements. The foregoing capital expenditures are not expected to reduce our ability to invest in other appropriate and necessary capital projects and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCash Used for Financing Activities\nDuring 2020, financing activities consisted primarily of $212.7 million proceeds from borrowings under the revolving credit facility, primarily to fund the Tekra acquisition, net repayments on borrowings of $165.3 million, cash dividends of $55.0 million paid to SWM stockholders and share repurchases of $1.0 million.\nDuring 2019, financing activities consisted primarily of net repayments on borrowings of $80.5 million, cash dividends of $54.4 million paid to SWM stockholders and share repurchases of $0.9 million.\nDividend Payments\nWe have declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock every fiscal quarter since the second quarter of 1996. On February 18, 2021, we announced a cash dividend of $0.44 per share payable on March 26, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 12, 2021. The covenants contained in our Indenture and Credit Agreement, each, as defined below in \"Debt Instruments and Related Covenants,\" require that we maintain certain financial ratios, as disclosed in Note 14. Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, none of which under normal business conditions materially limit our ability to pay such dividends. We will continue to assess our dividend policy in light of our overall strategy, cash generation, debt levels and ongoing requirements for cash to fund operations and to pursue possible strategic opportunities.\nShare Repurchases\nIn 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 27,779 shares and 25,297 shares, respectively, of our common stock at a cost of $1.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively, for the value of employees' stock-based compensation share awards surrendered to satisfy their personal statutory income tax withholding obligations.\nDebt Instruments and Related Covenants\n\nNet proceeds from borrowings were $47.4 million during 2020.\nOn February 10, 2021 we amended our existing Credit Agreement to provide for an additional Term Loan Facility Term Loan B\u201d which provides for additional capacity of $350 million. See Note 25. Subsequent Event, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Term Loan B. Other than potential borrowings under the Term Loan B, the Company does not expect to incur any significant additional borrowings during 2021.\nCredit Agreement\nOn September 25, 2018, the Company entered into a $700.0 million credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which replaced the Company's previous senior secured credit facilities and provides for a five-year $500.0 million revolving line of credit (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a seven-year $200.0 million bank term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d). Subject to certain conditions, including the absence of a default or event of default under the Credit Agreement, the Company may request incremental loans to be extended under the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility so long as the Company is in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement and the aggregate of such increases does not exceed $400.0 million. See Note 14. Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (i) 1.75% in excess of a reserve adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or (ii) 0.75% in excess of an alternative base rate. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will initially bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (i) 2.00% in excess of a reserve adjusted LIBOR rate or (ii) 1.00% in excess of an alternative base rate. The Term Loan amortizes at the rate of 1.0% per year and will mature on September 25, 2025. Unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement was $445.0 million as of December 31, 2020. We also had availability under our bank overdraft facilities and lines of credit of $6.7 million as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the Indenture and Credit Agreement at December 31, 2020. With the current level of borrowing and forecasted results, we expect to remain in compliance with our Credit Agreement financial covenants.\nOur total debt to capital ratios, as calculated under the Credit Agreement, at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were 47.7% and 47.6%, respectively.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn September 25, 2018, the Company closed a private offering of $350.0 million of 6.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company's existing and future wholly-owned subsidiaries that is a borrower under or that guarantees obligations under the Credit Agreement, as defined below, or that guarantees certain other indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the Indenture\u201d), dated as of September 25, 2018, by and among the Company, the guarantors listed therein and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that interest on the Notes will accrue from September 25, 2018 and is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2019, and the Notes mature on October 1, 2026.\nThe Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time on or after October 1, 2021, at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Prior to October 1, 2021, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole\u201d premium as set forth in the Indenture. The Company may redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes on or prior to October 1, 2021 with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106.875% of the principal amount of the Notes. If the Company sells certain assets or consummates certain change of control transactions, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes, subject to certain conditions.\nFor a comparison of liquidity and capital resources and the Company's cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nOTHER FACTORS AFFECTING LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table represents our future contractual cash requirements for the next five years and thereafter for our long-term debt obligations and other commitments ($ in millions):\n\n(1) Current debt excludes debt issuance costs", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to \"SWM,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" or similar terms include Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with an understanding of our recent performance, our financial condition and our prospects. The following will be discussed and analyzed:\n\u2022 SUMMARY;\n\u2022 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES;\n\u2022 RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS;\n\u2022 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS;\n\u2022 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES;\n\u2022 OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES;\n\u2022 OUTLOOK; and\n\u2022 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\nCOVID-19 Overview\nAs a result of global economic and social disruption caused by the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d), the Company's sales, manufacturing operations, profitability, and cash flow have been, and may continue to be, impacted. This is an uncertain period with events and circumstances changing frequently, and while senior management is meeting regularly to address all aspects of the pandemic, the magnitude and duration of economic disruption is difficult to predict. This overview is intended to provide management's view of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the Company in 2020 and projected future impacts to assist investors in understanding these developments. These comments contain forward looking statements about operations, financial performance and liquidity, and are current as of December 31, 2020. Further details about the risks and impacts discussed in the section below can be found in the forward-looking statements and Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\".\nHealth and Safety. We maintain a primary commitment to the health of our global teams. As such, the Company has reviewed and modified our standard operating procedures to reflect the increased needs from the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to reassess our safety practices as developments occur and new information becomes available. We have reviewed all work responsibilities and those employees who are able have been encouraged to work remotely. At operating sites, we have increased our health and safety protocols. These protocols include a stepped-up focus and employee education on hygiene and sterilization procedures. We have implemented social distancing requirements and staggered schedules where appropriate. We have also increased guidelines for all employees on how to safely handle potential infections, including temperature checks prior to entering the site and self-quarantine/return to work requirements.\nEnd-markets and sales. SWM serves a variety of end-markets around the world, each with unique demand dynamics. Management believes many of the Company's end-markets have been and will remain relatively insulated from COVID-19-related economic challenges; however, some end-markets have been negatively affected by decreased demand, particularly transportation. In addition, sales results in 2020 have, and may continue to demonstrate, some volatility from potential inventory builds as customers manage inventories and safety stocks to protect against future potential supply chain disruptions.\nTobacco (EP) - The Company's largest single end-market is the tobacco industry, which has not been materially affected by the pandemic, given the consumer staple nature of the industry. The company believes some customers have increased their inventory levels to minimize supply chain impacts of potential future COVID-19 related disruptions.\nMedical (AMS) - The Company's medical products are largely used in finger bandages, diagnostic test strips, and hospital-setting products, and management believes sales of these products are not sensitive to COVID-19-related economic weakness.\nFiltration (AMS) - The Company serves water and other filtration markets, and management believes these products are generally less sensitive to economic volatility than typical industrial goods. Air filtration products have seen accelerated demand in 2020 due to heightened focus on air quality and attempts to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\nTransportation (AMS) - The Company's primary products are aftermarket automotive paint protection films, which management believes can deliver steady long-term growth due to increasing global consumer adoption of these products. In 2020, however, this category faced pronounced temporary near-term negative impacts, beginning late in the first quarter through most of the third quarter, as a result of significant auto industry disruption and consumer purchasing behaviors as a result of COVID-19. However, late in the third quarter of and throughout the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company's transportation sales began to improve significantly.\nInfrastructure & Construction (AMS) - The Company's key products service highway development, residential construction, oil and gas site services and various other industrial projects which must move soil and require erosion and sediment control. Management believes these end-markets have been impacted by local self-distancing regulations that may affect the construction industry, but these end markets could be positively supported by a potential increase in infrastructure spending if governments provide stimulus funding to reinvigorate economic activities.\nIndustrial (AMS & EP) - The Company's products service a broad range of applications, some of which are considered to be sensitive to economic activity and associated impacts of COVID-19, while other applications have delivered growth in 2020.\nManufacturing & Operations. Beyond the potential general demand impacts described above, the Company's operations have been moderately affected by external supply chain and customer-driven disruptions as well as within the Company's manufacturing footprint. During the initial onset of the epidemic, the Company temporarily shut down manufacturing operations and/or total operations at certain sites to implement enhanced safety and hygiene procedures or to respond to temporary government orders. Where possible, the Company continued to ship products from inventories on hand, and the financial impact of these disruptions did not have a material impact on the Company's full year results. At present, all facilities are operational. Furthermore, there have been only isolated and temporary customer shutdowns, and the Company is maintaining active dialogue with all key customers and suppliers regarding supply chain and production planning. The Company's primary raw materials remain readily available in the global marketplace and no significant procurement challenges have risen. Many of the Company's products in our AMS segment have been deemed essential\u201d (e.g., filtration and medical) by local governments and thus the production facilities are not expected to have further shutdowns unless local governments mandate temporary closure or there are additional health and safety concerns beyond the current circumstances.\nFinancial Results Impacts & Outlook. During the first quarter, the Company generally performed above internal expectations despite moderate COVID-19 related impacts, the most significant of which was the reduced sales of transportation films sold into China. However early signs of additional COVID-19 demand disruption led to the Company withdrawing its 2020 financial guidance in May in an abundance of caution (please refer to first quarter 2020 earnings press release and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 6, 2020 for additional commentary). During the second and third quarters, the Company's results, primarily in the AMS segment, were impacted due to softer demand in several regions as a result of decreased customer ordering beginning in March 2020 when the pandemic\nimpact spread globally and cases dramatically increased. Subsequently, the Company saw strong sales growth in the fourth quarter as certain key AMS end-markets such as transportation, filtration, and infrastructure and construction showed strong growth. For the full year, the company remained profitable and generated operating cash flow slightly higher than 2019 levels.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company conducted extensive sensitivity analyses on the potential 2020 financial impacts, particularly on cash flow and liquidity. These sensitivity tests included a range of outcomes from demand-only disruption, to multi-week shutdowns across our manufacturing footprint with all sales, production, and shipping halted. Given the recent financial results, coupled with management's belief that a meaningful escalation of manufacturing disruptions is unlikely, the Company's operating cash flows, cash on hand, and credit facility availability, are expected to provide ample liquidity to support the Company's operating needs and financial obligations, including cash dividend to stockholders.\nThe Company also continues to actively assess the credit worthiness of its customers in the context of the potential business disruptions from COVID-19 but has not yet seen evidence of a material change to its ability to collect accounts receivable balances.\nLiquidity & Debt Overview. The Company had $593.3 million of total debt, $54.7 million of cash, and undrawn capacity on its revolving credit facility of $445.0 million at the end of 2020. Net leverage was 2.3x at the end of 2020, versus a maximum covenant ratio of 4.5x per the terms of the credit facility, though covenants contain an acquisition-related provision, allowing net leverage to reach 5.0x throughout 2020. The Company's nearest debt maturity is the revolving credit facility which is due in 2023. Please refer to liquidity and capital resources section for additional detail.\nSUMMARY\nIn 2020, SWM reported net income of $83.8 million on total net sales of $1,074.4 million. Compared to the prior year, net sales increased $51.6 million, due primarily to incremental sales from the March 2020 Tekra acquisition of $77.3 million. The acquisition growth was offset by low single-digit sales declines in EP and AMS (excluding Tekra). Within AMS (excluding Tekra), Medical sales were up double-digits, while Filtration and Industrial sales were up modestly. Transportation and Infrastructure and Construction each declined, as they were more impacted by COVID-19 related demand disruptions, though each grew during the fourth quarter, with particularly strong growth in transportation.\nNet income decreased to $83.8 million in 2020 compared to $85.8 million in 2019. Outside of typical business drivers, several large one-time items affect the year-over-year comparison. In 2020, the most significant expense included $11.7 million of restructuring, impairment, and other expenses related to the shut-down of the Spotswood, New Jersey facility. In 2019, these one-time items included $6.6 million (after- tax) of expenses related to Brazil tax assessments.\nCash provided by operations was $161.6 million in 2020 up from $160.3 million in 2019. Other uses and proceeds of cash during 2020 included $169.3 million consideration to acquire Tekra, $47.4 million net in proceeds from long debt issuances and repayments, $55.0 million in cash dividends paid to SWM stockholders and $33.3 million of capital spending including capitalized software.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe disclose those accounting policies that we consider to be significant in determining the amounts to be utilized for communicating our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the first note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities reported and disclosure of contingencies. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the estimates and judgments made for each of the following items and our accounting for and presentation of these items in the accompanying financial statements:\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The complexity of our global structure requires technical expertise in determining the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions and consolidated income tax expense.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss).\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"), states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. We (1) record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and (2) adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted into law effective January 1, 2018. The new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected the Company, and include but are not limited to a one-time deemed repatriation tax on post-1986 accumulated earnings and profits of the foreign subsidiary undistributed earnings ( transition tax\u201d), a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a new deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (\"FDII\"), and a new provision designed to tax Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) of foreign subsidiaries effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the GILTI provision, the FASB issued Staff Q&A Topic 740, No. 5 Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income\u201d requiring an entity to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense only. We have elected to account for GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. Management makes certain judgments in interpreting the manner in which complex key provisions of the Tax Act should be applied and in the determination of income tax expense and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe have two main sources of revenue: product sales and materials conversion. We recognize product sales revenues when control of a product is transferred to the customer. For the majority of product sales, transfer of control occurs when the products are shipped from one of our manufacturing facilities to the customer. The cost of delivering finished goods to our customers is recorded as a component of cost of products sold. Those costs include the amounts paid to a third party to deliver the finished goods. Any freight costs billed to and paid by a customer are included in net sales. We also provide services to customers through the conversion of customer-owned raw materials into processed finished goods. In these transactions, we generally recognize revenue as processing is completed.\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied, which generally occurs when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Generally, we consider collectability of amounts due under a contract to be probable upon inception of a sale based on an evaluation of the credit worthiness of each customer. If collectability is not considered to be probable, we defer recognition of revenue on satisfied performance obligations until the uncertainty is resolved. Any variable consideration, such as discounts or price concessions, is set forth in the terms of the contract at inception and is included in the assessment of the transaction price at the outset of the arrangement. The transaction price is allocated to the individual performance obligations due under the contract based on the relative stand-alone fair value of the performance obligations identified in the contract. We typically use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations.\nWe do not typically include extended payment terms or significant financing components in our contracts with customers. Certain product sales contracts may include cash-based incentives (volume rebates or credits), which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts at least quarterly based on the expected forecast quantities to be provided to customers and reduce revenues recognized accordingly. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense in the period incurred. We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. As a practical expedient, we treat shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the good transfers as fulfillment activities, and therefore, does not account for shipping and handling costs as a separate performance obligation.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nWe accrue an estimated loss by taking a charge to income when the likelihood that a future event, such as a legal proceeding, will result in a loss or the incurrence of a liability is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, and our cash flows.\nFor further information, please see \"Litigation\" in Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" and Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Valuation\nCertain of our manufacturing processes are capital intensive; as a result, we make substantial investments in property, plant and equipment which are recorded at cost. Net property, plant and equipment comprised 21% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Production machines and related equipment are not subject to substantial\ntechnological changes rendering them obsolete and are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of 10 to 20 years. When indications of impairment exist, we assess the likelihood of recovering the cost of long-lived assets based on our expectation of future profitability and undiscounted cash flow of the related asset group. These factors, along with management's plans with respect to the operations, are considered in assessing the recoverability of property, plant and equipment. Changes in management's estimates and plans could significantly impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of excess capacity in the tobacco-related papers industry and increased purchased material and operating costs experienced in the last several years, competitive selling prices for certain of our products are not sufficient to cover our costs with a reasonable margin. Such competitive pressures have resulted in downtime of certain paper machines and, in some cases, accelerated depreciation or impairment of certain equipment, and employee severance. We have also incurred restructuring costs in our AMS segment in pursuit of synergies from integrating our acquisitions. In recent years, we have restructured our operations to improve our competitiveness and profitability. As a result, we incurred significant charges related to asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and employee severances.\nManagement continues to evaluate how to operate our production facilities more effectively. Further restructuring actions are possible that might require additional impairments or accelerated depreciation of some equipment.\nBusiness Combinations\nAccounting for business combinations requires us to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed (\"net assets\") at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair values are based upon quoted market prices and widely accepted valuation techniques, which require significant estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill, based on new information obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of net assets acquired, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated financial statements. See Note 5. Business Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nInvestments in Equity Affiliates\nInvestments in companies which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence and that, in general, are at least 20 percent-owned by us, are stated at cost plus equity in undistributed net income. These investments are evaluated for impairment when warranted. An impairment loss would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary. In judging \"other than temporary,\" we consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the equity company investment has been less than the carrying amount, the near-term and longer-term operating and financial prospects of the equity company, and our longer-term intent of retaining the investment in the equity company. See Note 9. Joint Ventures, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGoodwill and Unamortized Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Fair value of a reporting unit is typically based upon estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or market-based comparables. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, then an analysis will be performed to\ncompare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. An impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount over its implied fair value. After an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis. The annual impairment tests performed on October 1, 2020 and 2019 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be indicated when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset are less than its carrying amount. An impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the fair value (based on discounted future cash flows) and the carrying amount of the asset. Estimated useful lives range from 10 to 23 years for customer relationships and 4 to 20 years for developed technology, patents and other intangible assets. Certain trade names are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not amortized. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment following a method similar to the impairment testing for Goodwill.

The increase of $66.3 million or 13.9% included the benefit from the Tekra acquisition (closed March 13, 2020), and gains in medical, filtration, and industrial end-markets. Medical sales were driven by higher demand for facemask materials and specialty hospital products. Filtration sales increased slightly with strong air filtration growth offset by mild softness in other areas. Industrial sales grew due to gains in packaging films and materials for wind turbine manufacturing. Those increases were partially offset by declines in transportation and infrastructure and construction sales driven by COVID-19 related pressures, however both end-markets rebounded in the fourth quarter, particularly transportation, moderating the full year declines. Excluding Tekra, AMS sales declined 2.3%.\nThe EP segment net sales were $530.9 million for 2020 compared to $545.6 million during 2019. The decrease of $14.7 million, or 2.7%, was primarily the result of the volume decline due to the continued strategic de-emphasis of non-tobacco volumes and tobacco industry attrition, which offset positive price/mix impact benefiting from a higher mix of high-value cigarette, Heat-not-Burn, and battery separator papers and a smaller proportion of lower-margin non-tobacco volumes.\nGross Profit\n(dollars in millions)\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Net Sales </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,074.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,022.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold </td> <td>766.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>732.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>308.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>290.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $18.3 million, or 6.3%, to $308.3 million from $290.0 million in the prior year. AMS gross profit increased by $9.5 million, primarily due to the incremental gross profits from the acquired Tekra business and lower input costs partially offset by declines in transportation and infrastructure and construction sales. In the EP segment, gross profit increased by $8.9 million, primarily due to positive price/mix impacts, cost reduction initiatives, lower input costs, and favorable impact of foreign currency movements, partially offset by $4.9 million of other restructuring-related charges in Cost of products, of which $2.0 million was to write down the value of certain spare parts and consignment inventories to estimated net realizable\nvalue and $2.9 million, resulting from the acceleration of depreciation and amortization for machinery and equipment.\nThe $4.9 million of other restructuring-related charges related to the decision to shut down the Spotswood, New Jersey facility and shift the production of paper made there to the Company's other facilities.

of $0.5 million in the 2020 period related to severance accruals as a result of department realignments.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, restructuring expense included $6.7 million in the EP segment relating to severance and other accruals as a result of the decision to shut down the Spotswood, New Jersey facility.\nThe EP segment also recognized $4.6 million of restructuring expenses in 2020 primarily related to severance accruals at our manufacturing operations in France and Poland. These restructuring charges relate to ongoing cost optimization initiatives to remain competitive within the EP segment.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, restructuring and impairment expenses consisted of $1.1 million in impairment charges at our U.S. and Chinese manufacturing facilities related to our AMS segment, as well as $2.6 million in severance accruals for employees at our U.S., Brazilian and French manufacturing operations related to the EP segment.\nOperating Profit\n(dollars in millions)\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Return on Net Sales </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advanced Materials & Structures </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Engineered Papers </td> <td>116.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated expenses </td> <td>(52.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating profit was $128.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $134.0 million during the prior year.\nThe AMS segment's operating profit in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $64.8 million compared to $64.3 million in the prior year period, up 1%, which reflected incremental operating profits from the Tekra acquisition partially offset by higher purchase accounting expenses related to the Tekra acquisition.\nThe EP segment's operating profit in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $116.8 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 2.0%, from $119.2 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to $16.2 million of restructuring and impairment expenses and other restructuring related charges of which $11.7 million was related to the shut-down of the Spotswood, New Jersey facility as discussed above, partially offset by positive price/mix impacts, cost structure improvements, lower raw material costs and favorable currency movements mostly from lower local currency operating costs in Brazil.\nUnallocated expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020 were $52.8 million, up $3.3 million, or 6.7%, from the $49.5 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the result of transaction expenses associated with the Tekra acquisition, and third-party consulting costs.\nNon-Operating Expenses, Net\nInterest expense was $30.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $5.6 million from $36.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due mainly to $7.1 million of non-recurring interest expense related to Brazil tax assessments in the year of 2019. Interest expense on debt was up $1.5 million primarily due to incremental debt related to the Tekra acquisition.\nThe weighted average effective interest rate on our debt facilities was approximately 4.02% and 4.42% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOther expense, net was $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 unchanged versus the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nAn $18.4 million and $15.2 million provision for income taxes in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulted in an effective tax rate of 18.9% compared with 15.7% in the prior year. The Company's effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% due to varying tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions and a year over year $4.2 million reduction due to the one-time Brazil ICMS litigation accrual in 2019.\nIncome (Loss) from Equity Affiliates\nIncome from equity affiliates, net of income taxes, was $4.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with income of $4.1 million during the prior year, and reflects the results of operations of CTM and CTS.\nNet Income and Income per Share\nNet income in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $83.8 million, or $2.66 per diluted share, compared with $85.8 million, or $2.76 per diluted share, during the prior year period.\nFor a comparison of the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2020.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nA major factor in our liquidity and capital resource planning is our generation of cash flow from operations, which is sensitive to changes in the mix of products sold, volume and pricing of our products, as well as changes in our production volumes, costs and working capital. Our liquidity is supplemented by funds available under our revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that is used as either operating conditions or strategic opportunities warrant.\nCash Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2020, $39.4 million of our $54.7 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital, including cash on-hand, cash generated from operations and our existing credit facilities, will be sufficient to finance our continued operations and growth strategy.\nWe generally fund our capital projects using cash on-hand, cash generated from operations and our existing credit facilities, including the Credit Agreement, as defined below in \"Debt Instruments and Related Covenants.\"\nCash Provided by Operations\nNet cash provided by operations was $161.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $160.3 million in the prior year.\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net operating working capital of $232.3 million including cash and cash equivalents of $54.7 million, compared with net operating working capital of $271.8 million including cash and cash equivalents of $103.0 million as of December 31, 2019. These changes primarily reflect the impact of the Tekra acquisition and increases in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nIn 2020, net changes in operating working capital decreased cash flow by $5.7 million. In 2019, net changes in operating working capital decreased cash flow by $1.8 million. The most significant working capital related cash outflow item was related to higher accounts receivable, as a result of strong Q4 organic sales.\nCash Used for Investing\nCash used for investing activities during 2020 was $203.1 million and consisted primarily of the net $169.3 million consideration to acquire Tekra. Capital spending including capitalized software totaled $33.3 million, down $0.8 million. In response to COVID-19 related impacts to certain end-markets, management continues to monitor cash flow trends and has deferred some discretionary capital spending originally planned for 2020.\nCash used for investing activities during 2019 was $14.8 million and consisted primarily of cash paid for capital spending partially offset by proceeds from the sale of RTL Philippines assets.\nCapital Spending\nCapital spending including capitalized software was $33.3 million, and $34.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020 and 2019 capital spending was primarily related to support growth in filtration and transportation on AMS manufacturing facilities in China, the development of new products, the rebuild of certain paper manufacturing lines, and IT infrastructure.\nWe incur capital spending as necessary to meet legal requirements and otherwise in connection with the protection of the environment at our facilities in the U.S., United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China and Poland. For these purposes, we expect to incur capital expenditures of less than $1.0 million in each of 2021 and 2022, of which no material amount is expected to be the result of environmental fines or settlements. The foregoing capital expenditures are not expected to reduce our ability to invest in other appropriate and necessary capital projects and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCash Used for Financing Activities\nDuring 2020, financing activities consisted primarily of $212.7 million proceeds from borrowings under the revolving credit facility, primarily to fund the Tekra acquisition, net repayments on borrowings of $165.3 million, cash dividends of $55.0 million paid to SWM stockholders and share repurchases of $1.0 million.\nDuring 2019, financing activities consisted primarily of net repayments on borrowings of $80.5 million, cash dividends of $54.4 million paid to SWM stockholders and share repurchases of $0.9 million.\nDividend Payments\nWe have declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock every fiscal quarter since the second quarter of 1996. On February 18, 2021, we announced a cash dividend of $0.44 per share payable on March 26, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 12, 2021. The covenants contained in our Indenture and Credit Agreement, each, as defined below in \"Debt Instruments and Related Covenants,\" require that we maintain certain financial ratios, as disclosed in Note 14. Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, none of which under normal business conditions materially limit our ability to pay such dividends. We will continue to assess our dividend policy in light of our overall strategy, cash generation, debt levels and ongoing requirements for cash to fund operations and to pursue possible strategic opportunities.\nShare Repurchases\nIn 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 27,779 shares and 25,297 shares, respectively, of our common stock at a cost of $1.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively, for the value of employees' stock-based compensation share awards surrendered to satisfy their personal statutory income tax withholding obligations.\nDebt Instruments and Related Covenants\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Instruments and Related Covenants ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in short-term debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from issuances of long-term debt </td> <td>212.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments on long-term debt </td> <td>(165.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(99.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net proceeds (repayments) from borrowings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(80.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet proceeds from borrowings were $47.4 million during 2020.\nOn February 10, 2021 we amended our existing Credit Agreement to provide for an additional Term Loan Facility Term Loan B\u201d which provides for additional capacity of $350 million. See Note 25. Subsequent Event, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Term Loan B. Other than potential borrowings under the Term Loan B, the Company does not expect to incur any significant additional borrowings during 2021.\nCredit Agreement\nOn September 25, 2018, the Company entered into a $700.0 million credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which replaced the Company's previous senior secured credit facilities and provides for a five-year $500.0 million revolving line of credit (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a seven-year $200.0 million bank term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d). Subject to certain conditions, including the absence of a default or event of default under the Credit Agreement, the Company may request incremental loans to be extended under the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility so long as the Company is in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement and the aggregate of such increases does not exceed $400.0 million. See Note 14. Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (i) 1.75% in excess of a reserve adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or (ii) 0.75% in excess of an alternative base rate. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will initially bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (i) 2.00% in excess of a reserve adjusted LIBOR rate or (ii) 1.00% in excess of an alternative base rate. The Term Loan amortizes at the rate of 1.0% per year and will mature on September 25, 2025. Unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement was $445.0 million as of December 31, 2020. We also had availability under our bank overdraft facilities and lines of credit of $6.7 million as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the Indenture and Credit Agreement at December 31, 2020. With the current level of borrowing and forecasted results, we expect to remain in compliance with our Credit Agreement financial covenants.\nOur total debt to capital ratios, as calculated under the Credit Agreement, at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were 47.7% and 47.6%, respectively.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn September 25, 2018, the Company closed a private offering of $350.0 million of 6.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company's existing and future wholly-owned subsidiaries that is a borrower under or that guarantees obligations under the Credit Agreement, as defined below, or that guarantees certain other indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the Indenture\u201d), dated as of September 25, 2018, by and among the Company, the guarantors listed therein and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that interest on the Notes will accrue from September 25, 2018 and is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2019, and the Notes mature on October 1, 2026.\nThe Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time on or after October 1, 2021, at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Prior to October 1, 2021, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole\u201d premium as set forth in the Indenture. The Company may redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes on or prior to October 1, 2021 with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106.875% of the principal amount of the Notes. If the Company sells certain assets or consummates certain change of control transactions, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes, subject to certain conditions.\nFor a comparison of liquidity and capital resources and the Company's cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nOTHER FACTORS AFFECTING LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table represents our future contractual cash requirements for the next five years and thereafter for our long-term debt obligations and other commitments ($ in millions):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments due for the years ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current debt (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (2)\n</td> <td>593.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>344.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt interest (3)\n</td> <td>160.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring obligations (4)\n</td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum operating lease\npayments (5)\n</td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations -
