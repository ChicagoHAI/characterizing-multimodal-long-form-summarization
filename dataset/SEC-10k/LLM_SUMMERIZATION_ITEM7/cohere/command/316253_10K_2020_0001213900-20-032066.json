Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSee in this Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 Part 1. Item 1. Business, for Forward Looking Cautionary Statements.\nThe Company's Enzo Clinical Laboratory Services and Enzo Life Sciences Products reporting units, as described below, are affected by different US and global economic conditions which are included in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nWith the coronavirus pandemic affecting people on a regional and global basis, the Company launched a rapid response to market demand for COVID-19 testing products and services. Enzo is delivering testing and lab services to schools, institutions, urgent care facilities, and core multi-state network of medical practices. Furthermore, the Company's GENFLEX\u2122 platform received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July for its proprietary product for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. FDA EUA demonstrates the Company's unique integrated in-house capability in developing low cost, high throughput sensitive detection platforms for COVID-19 as well as other diseases. The Authorization was for a comprehensive platform enabling rapid scalability of testing, including internal use within Enzo's Clinical Lab as well as for the sale of instrumentation, consumables, and reagents to other diagnostic testing customers. The Authorization includes three diverse platforms: Enzo's proprietary GENFLEX\u2122 automated high-throughput platform, a medium-throughput industry standard platform, and Enzo's manual workflow. Launching a COVID-19 test on its proprietary GENFLEX \u2122 molecular diagnostics platform serves as representative of the Company's capabilities as it develops other tests on the platform including an upper respiratory panel, STDs and expanded women's health panels. The Company is well positioned to replicate this success in response to new emerging health issues and needs, including, but not limited to, upper respiratory, sexually transmitted diseases, viral load, and women's health.\nWe are comprised of three operating companies that have evolved out of our core competence: the use of nucleic acids as informational molecules and the use of compounds for immune modulation. These wholly-owned operating companies and the foreign subsidiaries of Enzo Life Sciences conduct their operations through three reportable segments. Below are brief descriptions of each of the three operating segments (see Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements):\nEnzo Clinical Laboratory Services is a regional clinical laboratory serving the greater New York and New Jersey medical communities and expanding into Connecticut. The Company believes having clinical diagnostic services allows us to capitalize first hand on our extensive advanced molecular and cytogenetic capabilities and the broader trends in predictive and personalized diagnostics. We offer a menu of routine and esoteric clinical laboratory tests or procedures used in general patient care by physicians to establish or support a diagnosis, monitor treatment or medication, or search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition. We operate a full-service clinical laboratory in Farmingdale, New York, a network of 34 patient service centers throughout greater New York and New Jersey, a free-standing STAT\u201d or rapid response laboratories in New York City and Connecticut, and a full-service phlebotomy center and an in-house logistics department. Payments for clinical laboratory testing services are made by the Medicare program, healthcare insurers and patients.\nThe Clinical Laboratory Services reporting unit is impacted by various risk factors, including among others, reduced reimbursements from third party payers for testing performed and from recent health care legislation. Despite the growth we have experienced in previous years, there can be no assurance future growth can be achieved. The introduction of new molecular and esoteric tests is expected to increase our revenue per test and could offset impacts from the above factors. The Company anticipates improved profitability with increased service volume.\nEnzo Life Sciences Products manufactures, develops and markets products and tools to life sciences, drug development and clinical research customers world-wide and has amassed a large patent and technology portfolio. Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. is a recognized leader in labeling and detection technologies across research and diagnostic markets. Our strong portfolio of proteins, antibodies, peptides, small molecules, labeling probes, dyes and kits provides life science researchers tools for target identification/validation, high content analysis, gene expression analysis, nucleic acid detection, protein biochemistry and detection, and cellular analysis. We are globally recognized and acknowledged as a leader in manufacturing, in-licensing, and commercialization of over 40,000 products. Our strategic focus is directed to innovative high quality research reagents and kits in the primary key research areas of genomics, immunohistochemistry, immunoassays, cellular analysis, and small molecule chemistry. The segment is an established source for a comprehensive panel of products to scientific experts in the fields of cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, diabetes and obesity, endocrine disorders, infectious and autoimmune disease, hepatotoxicity and renal injury.\nEnzo Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical venture that has developed multiple novel approaches in the areas of gastrointestinal, infectious, ophthalmic and metabolic diseases, many of which are derived from the pioneering work of Enzo Life Sciences. The Company has focused its efforts on developing treatment regimens for diseases and conditions in which current treatment options are ineffective, costly, and/or cause unwanted side effects. This focus has generated a clinical and preclinical pipeline, as well as more than 100 patents and patent applications.\nThe following table summarizes the sources of revenues for the fiscal years

period\u201d refer to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nClinical services revenues for the 2020 period were $49.5 million compared to $51.1 million in the 2019 period, a decrease of $1.6 million or 3%. Revenues for the 2020 period include two CARES Act Relief Payment grants totaling $1.5 million. Due to COVID-19, diagnostic testing volume measured by the total number of accessions for all our testing services decreased 7% period over period, resulting in the 2020 period's revenue decrease. COVID-19 testing services provided in the four months of the 2020 period partially offset the impact of the decline in total testing volume and also contributed to liquidation rate improvement. In the latter part of our third quarter, while accessions had not returned to prior year levels, we started to see accession volume rebound. Due to the addition of COVID-19 testing, accession volume in the month of July 2020 exceeded July 2019 volume. In the normal course of business, estimated collection amounts are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of third party payer billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as issues unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, and require us to consider the potential for adjustments when estimating variable consideration in the recognition of revenue in the period that the related services are rendered. The impact from the Protecting Access to Medicare Act ( PAMA\u201d) continues to negatively impact reimbursements from Medicare and third party payers.\nProduct revenues for the 2020 and 2019 periods were $26.6 million and $30.1 million, respectively. The decrease of $3.5 million or 12% is the result of the policies and initiatives ordered by national and local governments designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. The negative effect of these government policies on our products revenues was greater in the U.S. market than markets in the rest of the world, and began in the latter half of the third quarter of the 2020 period.\nThe cost of Clinical Services was $38.9 million in the 2020 period and $44.2 million in the 2019 period, a decrease of $5.3 million, attributable to the overall decline in testing volume, resulting in reduction in reagent usage and outside reference testing expense. The gross profit margin on Clinical Services revenues, excluding the grants in the 2020 period, was 19.0% in the 2020 period and 13.4% in the 2019 period. In the 2020 period, liquidation rate improvements and the higher margin on COVID-19 testing helped to offset the effect of reduced volumes of our genetics and core testing services.\nThe cost of product revenues was $13.4 million in the 2020 period and $13.7 million in the 2019 period, a decrease of $0.3 million or 2% due to the decrease in revenues. The gross profit margin on products was 49.6% in the 2020 period and 54.4% in the 2019 period, negatively impacted by the decline of higher margin sales in the U.S. market from COVID-19.\nResearch and development expenses were $4.4 million in the 2020 period and $3.2 million in the 2019 period, an increase of $1.2 million or 38%. The increase is entirely attributed to the Clinical Services division for lab developed tests (LDTs) including those based on our proprietary GENFLEX\u2122 platform. During the 2020 period, our research was focused on lab developed tests for the detection of COVID-19 and for the detection of COVID-19 antibodies. Our lab developed test for the detection of COVID-19 was approved under the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority. Other tests based on GENFLEX\u2122 were approved by The New York State Department of Health.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $43.0 million during the 2020 period versus $44.3 million during the 2019 period, a decrease of $1.3 million or 3%. The Clinical Services expense decreased $0.7 million due to cost savings initiatives and lower commissions. The Life Sciences Products expense decreased $1.4 million due to reductions in sales, marketing and administrative salaries and related costs, travel expenses, and intangibles amortization. The other segment increased $0.8 million primarily for higher self-insured healthcare benefit costs and occupancy costs.\nLegal and related expenses were $6.7 million during the 2020 period compared to $3.0 million in the 2019 period, an increase of $3.7 million. During the 2020 period, we incurred $4.1 million for contested proxy costs relating to our February 2020 annual shareholders meeting. Third-party payers, including government programs, may decide to deny payment or recoup payments for testing that they contend was improperly billed or not medically necessary, against their coverage determinations, or for which they believe they have otherwise overpaid (including as a result of their own error), and we may be required to refund payments already received. During the third fiscal quarter of 2019, a significant third-party payer informed us outside of their typical business practice that they believed it overpaid us during certain periods of fiscal 2018. We disputed these claims and sent legal appeal letters to the payer. In the 2020 period, we recorded $0.8 million in legal and related expenses as a result of reduced reimbursements this payer made to us. In the third quarter of the 2020 period, we and the payer entered into a settlement agreement and release whereby the parties agrees that the $0.8 million previously withheld by the payer fully and completely satisfied the dispute. Legal expense associated with other legal activity including costs associated with on-going litigation and contract disputes decreased $1.2 million due to the timing of activities.\nLegal settlements, net were $28.9 million in the 2019 period versus none in the 2020 period. During the 2019 period the Company as plaintiff finalized and executed settlement agreements with Roche ($19.4 million, net), and Hologic Inc. ($9.5 million, net).\nInterest income, net was $0.5 million in the 2020 period and $1.1 million in the 2019 period and represents interest on cash and cash equivalents net of interest expense. During the 2020 period, the amount of investable cash was lower as were interest rates earned on deposits. Due to the actions by the Federal Reserve to cut its target interest rates near zero in response to COVID-19, we expect there will be substantially no interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents for the foreseeable future.\nThe foreign currency revaluation gain recognized by the Life Sciences Products segment during the 2020 period was $0.9 million compared to a loss of $0.7 million in the 2019 period, a favorable variance of $1.6 million. The gain was due to year over year appreciation of the British pound and Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar as of the end of the 2020 period, compared to their year over year depreciation as of the end of the 2019 period.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal year ended July 31, 2019 compared to July 31, 2018\n(in 000s)\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>Comparative Financial Data for the Fiscal Years Ended

services revenues for the 2019 period were $51.1 million compared to $71.1 million in the 2018 period, a decrease of $20.0 million or 28%. Services revenues were negatively affected by lower genetics testing volume approximating $8.8 million, attributable to increased competition. Services revenues were negatively affected by lower reimbursement rates of $9.8 million, of which $6.4 million is attributable to reduced genetics testing reimbursements as a result of an increase in denial rates and changes to medical and procedural requirements, and $3.4 million attributable to reimbursement rate declines from third party payers and the impact from the Protecting Access to Medicare Act ( PAMA\u201d). During the 2019 period, adjustments to estimated collection amounts from third party payers and HMO's also decreased services revenues by $1.4 million. Total diagnostic testing volume measured by the number of accessions decreased approximately 1%. In the normal course of business, estimated collection amounts are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of third party payer billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as issues unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, and require us to consider the potential for adjustments when estimating variable consideration in the recognition of revenue in the period that the related services are rendered.\nProduct revenues for the 2019 and 2018 periods was $30.1 million compared to $29.2 during 2018. The increase of $0.9 million or 3% is due to higher product order volume in the U.S. market, which was partially offset by lower product order volume in the international market and the negative impact of foreign exchange translation. There was no royalty income in the 2019 period as the license agreement expired during the 2018 period. Royalty income in 2018 period was $0.7 million.\nThe cost of Clinical Services during the 2019 period was $44.2 million as compared to $46.0 million in the 2018 period, a decrease of $1.8 million or 4% primarily due to the change in test mix, especially the decline in genetic testing volume. The components of the decrease are $3.1 million from a decrease in outside reference lab genetic testing costs, partially offset by increases in reagent and other test supplies of $0.7 million and compensation related expenses of $0.6 million.\nThe cost of product revenues was $13.7 million in the 2019 period and $14.4 million in the 2018 period, a decrease of $0.6 million or 4% due to due to the mix of products sold and a decrease in compensation expense. The gross profit margin on products was 54.4% in the 2019 period and 51.0% in the 2018 period. The 2019 improvement was due to favorable mix of products sold and lower discounting.\nResearch and development expenses were $3.2 million in the 2019 and 2018 periods. The expense for Life Sciences Products was $2.2 million for the 2019 period and $2.3 million for the 2018 period. The expense for Enzo Therapeutics was $0.9 million in both periods.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $44.3 million during the 2019 period versus $44.5 million during the 2018 period, a decrease of $0.2 million. Clinical Services expense decreased $0.4 million, primarily due to a $0.8 million reduction in outside billing and collections expenses, partially offset by increased costs to nationally market our new molecular diagnostic products for use by other reference labs of approximately $0.2 million, increased information technology costs to support our clients of $0.1 million, and increased office rent and utility costs of $0.1 million. Life Sciences Products expense increased $0.2 million due to higher business development salaries and related costs. Other segment expense remained the same during both periods.\nLegal fee expense was $3.0 million during the 2019 period compared to $5.1 million in the 2018 period, a decrease of $2.1 million due to the timing of legal activity and related costs associated with on-going litigation and contract dispute where the Company is the plaintiff.\nLegal settlements, net were $28.9 million in the 2019 period versus none in the 2018 period. During the 2019 period the Company as plaintiff finalized and executed settlement agreements with Roche ($19.4 million, net), and Hologic Inc. ($9.5 million, net).\nInterest income, net increased $0.2 million in the 2019 period due to increased interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalents.\nThe foreign currency loss incurred by the Life Sciences Products segment during the 2019 period was $0.7 million compared to $0.3 million in the 2018 period, an unfavorable variance of $0.4 million. During the 2019 period, there were greater revaluation losses due to the significant depreciation of the British pound and Euro versus the U.S. dollar compared to that of the 2018 period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt July 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $47.9 million of which $0.9 million was in foreign accounts, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $60.1 million, of which $0.7 million was in foreign accounts at July 31, 2019. It is the Company's current intent to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States, and its current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund its United States operations. The Company had working capital of $36.0 million at July 31, 2020 compared to $65.4 million at July 31, 2019. The decrease in working capital of $29.4 million was primarily due to the recognition of $28.5 million in net loss for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020.\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2020 was approximately $17.2 million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $4.8 million in fiscal 2019, an increase in net cash used in operations of approximately $22.0 million. This increase in net cash used in operating activities in the 2020 period versus 2019 was due to the year over year increase of $31.0 million in net loss, partially by a positive net change in adjustments and operating assets and liabilities of $9.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 was approximately $4.8 million as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2.7 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of approximately $7.5 million. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the 2019 period versus the 2018 period was primarily due to an increase in net income of $12.8 million derived from legal settlements reached in the 2019 period, offset by a net change in adjustments and operating assets and liabilities of $5.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was approximately $2.2 million as compared to $8.1 million in the 2019 period, a decrease of $5.9 million. The decrease in the 2020 period is primarily due to the impact in 2019 of the purchase of a facility in that period. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 was approximately $8.1 million as compared to $1.9 million in the 2018 period, an increase of $6.2 million. The increase in the 2019 period is primarily due to the purchase of our new facility.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020 was approximately $7.0 million as compared to $4.2 million in fiscal 2019. The increase of $2.8 million was primarily due to proceeds from the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loan. The PPP loan bears interest of 1% per annum. All or a portion of the PPP Loan, including interest, could be forgiven by the SBA by applying for forgiveness and providing acceptable documentation that demonstrates the funds were used as required by the terms of forgiveness and in accordance with the SBA's requirements. Due to complexities with respect to loan forgiveness calculations and government pronouncements with respect to expenditure eligibility, we did not recognize any loan forgiveness as of July 31, 2020 and have classified the loan as other short term debt as we expect to earn loan forgiveness on most, if not all of the loan in less than a year. See Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2019 was approximately $4.2 million as compared to cash provided of $0.6 million in fiscal 2018. The 2019 increase of $3.6 million was due to proceeds from a ten year mortgage agreement entered into for the purchase of our new facility, which bears a fixed interest rate of 5.09% per annum and requires monthly mortgage payments of $30. The Company's obligations under the mortgage agreement are secured by the new facility and by a $750 cash collateral deposit with the mortgagee as additional security. This restricted cash is included in other assets as of July 31, 2020. As of July 31, 2020, the Company was not in compliance with a financial ratio covenant related to this mortgage. Effective October 19, 2020, the Company and the mortgagee agreed to a covenant restructure whereby the mortgagee waived the Company's financial ratio covenant for the fiscal period ended July 31, 2020 and modified the mortgage to replace that covenant with a liquidity covenant. The liquidity covenant requires that we own and maintain at all times and throughout the remaining term of the loan at least $25 million of liquid assets, defined as time deposits, money market accounts and obligations issued by the U.S. government or any of its agencies. The cash collateral agreement was also modified to require compliance with the liquidity covenant for two consecutive fiscal years before the collateral is released back to us.\nThe Company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents level, and utilization of the Controlled Equity Offering program if necessary, as disclosed in Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are sufficient for its foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs over at least the next twelve (12) months, although there can be no assurance that future events will not alter such view. Although there can be no assurances, in the event additional capital is required, the Company believes it has the ability to raise additional funds through equity offerings or other sources. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d section of this Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2020, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans.\nEffect of New Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn August 1, 2019, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) on accounting for leases using the modified retrospective method. This new accounting standard requires a lessee to recognize an asset and liability for most leases on its balance sheet. The Company elected the optional transition method that allowed for a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings recorded on August 1, 2019 and did not restate previously reported results in the comparative periods. The Company also elected the package of practical expedients, which among other things, allowed it to carry forward its historical lease classification.\nAs a result of adoption of the new standard, the Company recorded right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of approximately $24.4 million and $25.1 million, respectively as of August 1, 2019. The operating lease liability was determined based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments and the right-of-use asset was determined based on the value of the lease liability, adjusted for deferred rent balances of approximately $0.7 million, which were previously included in accrued expenses. There was no cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. Accounting for the Company's finance leases remains substantially unchanged. The adoption of the new standard did not materially impact the Company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows. The adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in increased qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.\nThe Company elected the package of three practical expedients. As such, the Company did not reassess whether expired or existing contracts are or contain a lease and did not need to reassess the lease classifications or reassess the initial direct costs associated with expired or existing leases. The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient. Further, the land easement practical expedient was not elected as the practical expedient is not applicable to the Company. The Company elected to take the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components of all asset classes entered into or modified after the effective date. For further details, see Note 9 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements\nOn August 1, 2018, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by FASB on revenue recognition using the full retrospective method. This new accounting standard outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. This standard supersedes existing revenue recognition requirements and eliminates most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The core principle of the revenue recognition standard is to require an entity to recognize as revenue the amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to be entitled to when control of goods or services are transferred to its customers.\nAs a result of the Company's adoption of this standard, the majority of the amounts that were historically classified as bad debt expense, primarily related to patient responsibility, are now considered an implicit price concession in determining net revenues from clinical services. Accordingly, the Company reports estimated uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction of the transaction price and therefore as a reduction in net revenues, when historically these amounts were classified and separately reported as a provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The adoption of this standard has no impact on revenues reported for life sciences products. The adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in increased disclosure, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. For further details, see Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe impact of the adoption of the standard on prior period consolidated operations, cash flows and balance sheet is presented in the table below:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended July 31, 2018: </td> <td> </td> <td>As Previously Reported </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Adjustment for New Accounting Standard on Revenue Recognition </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Reclassification of Residual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As Restated </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td> 3,700 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,700 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,455 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,321 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,321 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows July 31, 2018:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,700 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,775 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,915 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consolidated balance sheet July 31, 2018: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accounts receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,523 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,292 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Less: Allowance for doubtful accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,523 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,147 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 1, 2018, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by FASB which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. Adoption of this standard requires that amendments in the update be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. For the foreseeable future, any excess income tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation, which would be recognized as discrete items within income tax expense rather than additional paid in capital, will be offset by an equivalent adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance. Accordingly, adoption of this standard had no impact on our reported operations.\nPronouncements Issued but Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This standard, as amended, changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including trade receivables, from an incurred loss method to a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses. The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adoption of this standard is required for our annual and interim periods beginning August 1, 2023, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe reviewed all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and have concluded they are not applicable or not expected to be significant to the accounting for our operations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has entered into various real estate and equipment operating leases, reagent rental agreements, and employment agreements with certain executive officers. The real estate lease for the Company's Farmingdale Clinical Lab and Research facility is with a related party. See Item 2, Properties, and Note 9 and Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of these leases and obligations.\nManagement is not aware of any material claims, disputes or settled matters concerning third-party reimbursements that would have a material effect on our financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements\u201d as such term is defined in Item 303(a) (4) of Regulation S-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Enzo Biochem, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOn an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to contractual expense, allowance for uncollectible accounts, inventory, intangible assets and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nContingencies\nContingencies are evaluated in accordance with ASC 450-20, Contingencies, and a liability is recorded when the matter is both probable and reasonably estimable. Gain contingencies are evaluated and not recognized until the gain is realizable or realized.\nProduct revenues and royalty income\nProducts revenues consist of the sale of single-use products used in the identification of genomic information and are recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Payment terms for shipments to end-user and distributor customers may range from 30 to 90 days. Any claims for credit or return of goods may be made generally within 30 days of receipt. Revenues are reduced to reflect estimated credits and returns, although historically these adjustments have not been material. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue, while the related shipping and handling costs are reflected in cost of products.\nRoyalty income is based on net sales of the Company's licensed products by a third party. We recognize royalty income in the period the sales occur based on third party evidence received\nRevenues - Clinical laboratory services\nNet revenues in the Company's clinical services business are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions. The services business, which provides clinical testing services, satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenues upon completion of the testing process for a specific patient and reporting to the ordering physician. The Company may also perform clinical testing services for other laboratories and will recognize revenue from those services when reported to the ordering laboratory. The Company estimates the amount of consideration it expects to receive from customer groups using the portfolio approach. These estimates of the expected consideration include the impact of contractual allowances and price concessions on our customer group portfolios consisting of healthcare insurers, government payers, client payers and patients. Contracts with customers in our laboratory services business do not contain a financing component, based on the typically limited period of time between performance of services and collection of consideration. The transaction price includes variable consideration in the form of the contractual allowance and price concessions as well as the collectability of the transaction based on patient intent and ability to pay. The Company uses the expected value method in estimating the amount of the variability included in the transaction price.\nContractual Adjustment\nThe Company's estimate of contractual adjustment is based on significant assumptions and judgments, such as its interpretation of payer reimbursement policies, and bears the risk of change. The estimation process is based on the experience of amounts approved as reimbursable and ultimately settled by payers, versus the corresponding gross amount billed to the respective payers. The contractual adjustment is an estimate that reduces gross revenue based on gross billing rates to amounts expected to be approved and reimbursed. Gross billings are based on a standard fee schedule we set for all third party payers, including Medicare, health maintenance organizations ( HMO's\u201d) and managed care. The Company adjusts the contractual adjustment estimate quarterly, based on its evaluation of current and historical settlement experience with payers, industry reimbursement trends, and other relevant factors. The other relevant factors that affect our contractual adjustment include the monthly and quarterly review of: 1) current gross billings and receivables and reimbursement by payer, 2) current changes in third party arrangements and 3) the growth of in-network provider arrangements and managed care plans specific to our Company.\nOur clinical laboratory services business is primarily dependent upon reimbursement from third-party payers, such as Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and insurers. We are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant changes of reimbursement rates. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage would negatively impact our revenues. The number of individuals covered under managed care contracts or other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future. In addition, Medicare and other government healthcare programs continue to shift to managed care. These trends will continue to reduce our revenues.\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the contractual adjustment percentages, determined using current and historical reimbursement statistics, were approximately 88%, 88% and 85%, respectively, of gross billings. The Company believes a decline in reimbursement rates or a shift to managed care, or similar arrangements may be offset by the positive impact of an increase in the number of tests we perform. However, there can be no assurance that we can increase the number of tests we perform or that if we do increase the number of tests we perform, that we can maintain that higher number of tests performed, or that an increase in the number of tests we perform would result in increased revenue.\nThe Company estimates (by using a sensitivity analysis) that each 1% point change in the contractual adjustment percentage could result in a change in clinical laboratory services revenues of approximately $3.9 million, $4.4 million, and $5.0 million, for the years ended July 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and a change in the net accounts receivable of approximately $0.5 and $0.4 million as of July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur clinical laboratory financial billing system records gross billings using a standard fee schedule for all payers and does not record contractual adjustment by payer at the time of billing. Therefore, we are unable to quantify the effect of contractual adjustment recorded during the current period that relate to revenue recorded in a previous period. However, we can reasonably estimate our monthly contractual adjustment to revenue on a timely basis based on our quarterly review process, which includes:\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>an analysis of industry reimbursement trends; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>an evaluation of third-party reimbursement rates changes and changes in reimbursement arrangements with third-party payers; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>a rolling monthly analysis of current and historical claim settlement and reimbursement experience statistics with payers; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>an analysis of current gross billings and receivables by payer. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which is estimated and recorded in the period of the related revenue.\nThe following is a table of the Company's net accounts receivable by segment. The Clinical Laboratory Services segment's net receivables are detailed by billing category and as a percent to its total net receivables. As of July 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 68% and 63% respectively, of the Company's net accounts receivable relates to its Clinical Laboratory Services business, which operates in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut medical communities. The Life Sciences products segment's accounts receivable includes approximately $1.0 million or 34% and $1.2 million or 32% of foreign receivables as of July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet accounts receivable (in thousands)\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>July 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>July 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Clinical Labs (by billing category) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Third party payers </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Patient self-pay </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Medicare </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>HMO's </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Clinical Labs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Life Sciences </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total accounts receivable - net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payers is critical to its operating performance and cash flows. The primary collection risk lies with uninsured patients or patients for whom primary insurance has paid but a patient portion remains outstanding. The Company also assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact, if any, on the allowance estimates, which involves judgment. The Company believes that the collectability of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes, most notably, those related to obtaining the accurate patient information in order to bill effectively for the services provided. Should circumstances change (e.g. shift in payer mix, decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of receivables), our estimates of net realizable value of receivables could be reduced by a material amount. As of July 31, 2020, approximately 11% of Clinical Labs receivables are from one payer.\nBilling for laboratory services is complicated because of many factors, especially: the differences between our standard gross fee schedule for all payers and the reimbursement rates of the various payers we deal with, disparity of coverage and information requirements among the various payers, and disputes with payers as to which party is responsible for reimbursement.\nThe following tables indicate the Clinical Laboratory Services segment aged gross receivables for the periods indicated by payer group (in thousands), which is prior to adjustment to gross receivables for: 1) contractual adjustment, 2) fully reserved balances not yet written off, and 3) other revenue adjustments.\nTable 60: <table>

the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The liability method requires that any tax benefits recognized for net operating loss carry forwards and other items be reduced by a valuation allowance where it is not more likely than not the benefits will be realized in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under the liability method, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. It is the Company's policy to provide for uncertain tax positions, if any, and the related interest and penalties based upon management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. To the extent the Company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the Company's effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected.\nInventory\nThe Company values inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Work-in-process and finished goods inventories consist of material, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Write downs of inventories to net realizable value are based on a review of inventory quantities on hand and estimated sales forecasts based on sales history and anticipated future demand. Unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and require additional write downs of inventory which would impact our results of operations.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Intangible assets (exclusive of patents), arose primarily from acquisitions, and primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, licenses, and website and database content. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized according to their estimated useful lives, which range from 4 to 15 years. Patents represent capitalized legal costs incurred in pursuing patent applications. When such applications result in an issued patent, the related capitalized costs, if any, are amortized over a ten year period or the life of the patent, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method. The Company reviews its issued patents and pending patent applications, and if it determines to abandon a patent application or that an issued patent no longer has economic value, the unamortized balance in deferred patent costs relating to that patent is immediately expensed.\nThe Company tests goodwill annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it identifies the reporting units and compares the fair value of each of these reporting units to their respective carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is less than its fair value, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, the impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite lives) of an asset or asset group for impairment annually as of the end of the fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. Should indicators of impairment exist, the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of an asset or asset group. The net book value of the long lived asset is adjusted to fair value if its expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than its book value.\nDuring fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, there was no impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets.", "summary": "- The clinical laboratory services market is expected to reach $71.4bn by 2024, driven by an increase in the number of tests required for

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSee in this Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 Part 1. Item 1. Business, for Forward Looking Cautionary Statements.\nThe Company's Enzo Clinical Laboratory Services and Enzo Life Sciences Products reporting units, as described below, are affected by different US and global economic conditions which are included in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nWith the coronavirus pandemic affecting people on a regional and global basis, the Company launched a rapid response to market demand for COVID-19 testing products and services. Enzo is delivering testing and lab services to schools, institutions, urgent care facilities, and core multi-state network of medical practices. Furthermore, the Company's GENFLEX\u2122 platform received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July for its proprietary product for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. FDA EUA demonstrates the Company's unique integrated in-house capability in developing low cost, high throughput sensitive detection platforms for COVID-19 as well as other diseases. The Authorization was for a comprehensive platform enabling rapid scalability of testing, including internal use within Enzo's Clinical Lab as well as for the sale of instrumentation, consumables, and reagents to other diagnostic testing customers. The Authorization includes three diverse platforms: Enzo's proprietary GENFLEX\u2122 automated high-throughput platform, a medium-throughput industry standard platform, and Enzo's manual workflow. Launching a COVID-19 test on its proprietary GENFLEX \u2122 molecular diagnostics platform serves as representative of the Company's capabilities as it develops other tests on the platform including an upper respiratory panel, STDs and expanded women's health panels. The Company is well positioned to replicate this success in response to new emerging health issues and needs, including, but not limited to, upper respiratory, sexually transmitted diseases, viral load, and women's health.\nWe are comprised of three operating companies that have evolved out of our core competence: the use of nucleic acids as informational molecules and the use of compounds for immune modulation. These wholly-owned operating companies and the foreign subsidiaries of Enzo Life Sciences conduct their operations through three reportable segments. Below are brief descriptions of each of the three operating segments (see Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements):\nEnzo Clinical Laboratory Services is a regional clinical laboratory serving the greater New York and New Jersey medical communities and expanding into Connecticut. The Company believes having clinical diagnostic services allows us to capitalize first hand on our extensive advanced molecular and cytogenetic capabilities and the broader trends in predictive and personalized diagnostics. We offer a menu of routine and esoteric clinical laboratory tests or procedures used in general patient care by physicians to establish or support a diagnosis, monitor treatment or medication, or search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition. We operate a full-service clinical laboratory in Farmingdale, New York, a network of 34 patient service centers throughout greater New York and New Jersey, a free-standing STAT\u201d or rapid response laboratories in New York City and Connecticut, and a full-service phlebotomy center and an in-house logistics department. Payments for clinical laboratory testing services are made by the Medicare program, healthcare insurers and patients.\nThe Clinical Laboratory Services reporting unit is impacted by various risk factors, including among others, reduced reimbursements from third party payers for testing performed and from recent health care legislation. Despite the growth we have experienced in previous years, there can be no assurance future growth can be achieved. The introduction of new molecular and esoteric tests is expected to increase our revenue per test and could offset impacts from the above factors. The Company anticipates improved profitability with increased service volume.\nEnzo Life Sciences Products manufactures, develops and markets products and tools to life sciences, drug development and clinical research customers world-wide and has amassed a large patent and technology portfolio. Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. is a recognized leader in labeling and detection technologies across research and diagnostic markets. Our strong portfolio of proteins, antibodies, peptides, small molecules, labeling probes, dyes and kits provides life science researchers tools for target identification/validation, high content analysis, gene expression analysis, nucleic acid detection, protein biochemistry and detection, and cellular analysis. We are globally recognized and acknowledged as a leader in manufacturing, in-licensing, and commercialization of over 40,000 products. Our strategic focus is directed to innovative high quality research reagents and kits in the primary key research areas of genomics, immunohistochemistry, immunoassays, cellular analysis, and small molecule chemistry. The segment is an established source for a comprehensive panel of products to scientific experts in the fields of cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, diabetes and obesity, endocrine disorders, infectious and autoimmune disease, hepatotoxicity and renal injury.\nEnzo Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical venture that has developed multiple novel approaches in the areas of gastrointestinal, infectious, ophthalmic and metabolic diseases, many of which are derived from the pioneering work of Enzo Life Sciences. The Company has focused its efforts on developing treatment regimens for diseases and conditions in which current treatment options are ineffective, costly, and/or cause unwanted side effects. This focus has generated a clinical and preclinical pipeline, as well as more than 100 patents and patent applications.\nThe following table summarizes the sources of revenues for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in $000's and percentages):\n\nResults of Operations\nFiscal year ending July 31, 2020 compared to July 31, 2019\n(in 000s)\nComparative Financial Data for the Fiscal Years Ended July 31,\n\n** not meaningful\nConsolidated Results:\nThe 2020 period\u201d and the 2019 period\u201d refer to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nClinical services revenues for the 2020 period were $49.5 million compared to $51.1 million in the 2019 period, a decrease of $1.6 million or 3%. Revenues for the 2020 period include two CARES Act Relief Payment grants totaling $1.5 million. Due to COVID-19, diagnostic testing volume measured by the total number of accessions for all our testing services decreased 7% period over period, resulting in the 2020 period's revenue decrease. COVID-19 testing services provided in the four months of the 2020 period partially offset the impact of the decline in total testing volume and also contributed to liquidation rate improvement. In the latter part of our third quarter, while accessions had not returned to prior year levels, we started to see accession volume rebound. Due to the addition of COVID-19 testing, accession volume in the month of July 2020 exceeded July 2019 volume. In the normal course of business, estimated collection amounts are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of third party payer billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as issues unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, and require us to consider the potential for adjustments when estimating variable consideration in the recognition of revenue in the period that the related services are rendered. The impact from the Protecting Access to Medicare Act ( PAMA\u201d) continues to negatively impact reimbursements from Medicare and third party payers.\nProduct revenues for the 2020 and 2019 periods were $26.6 million and $30.1 million, respectively. The decrease of $3.5 million or 12% is the result of the policies and initiatives ordered by national and local governments designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. The negative effect of these government policies on our products revenues was greater in the U.S. market than markets in the rest of the world, and began in the latter half of the third quarter of the 2020 period.\nThe cost of Clinical Services was $38.9 million in the 2020 period and $44.2 million in the 2019 period, a decrease of $5.3 million, attributable to the overall decline in testing volume, resulting in reduction in reagent usage and outside reference testing expense. The gross profit margin on Clinical Services revenues, excluding the grants in the 2020 period, was 19.0% in the 2020 period and 13.4% in the 2019 period. In the 2020 period, liquidation rate improvements and the higher margin on COVID-19 testing helped to offset the effect of reduced volumes of our genetics and core testing services.\nThe cost of product revenues was $13.4 million in the 2020 period and $13.7 million in the 2019 period, a decrease of $0.3 million or 2% due to the decrease in revenues. The gross profit margin on products was 49.6% in the 2020 period and 54.4% in the 2019 period, negatively impacted by the decline of higher margin sales in the U.S. market from COVID-19.\nResearch and development expenses were $4.4 million in the 2020 period and $3.2 million in the 2019 period, an increase of $1.2 million or 38%. The increase is entirely attributed to the Clinical Services division for lab developed tests (LDTs) including those based on our proprietary GENFLEX\u2122 platform. During the 2020 period, our research was focused on lab developed tests for the detection of COVID-19 and for the detection of COVID-19 antibodies. Our lab developed test for the detection of COVID-19 was approved under the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority. Other tests based on GENFLEX\u2122 were approved by The New York State Department of Health.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $43.0 million during the 2020 period versus $44.3 million during the 2019 period, a decrease of $1.3 million or 3%. The Clinical Services expense decreased $0.7 million due to cost savings initiatives and lower commissions. The Life Sciences Products expense decreased $1.4 million due to reductions in sales, marketing and administrative salaries and related costs, travel expenses, and intangibles amortization. The other segment increased $0.8 million primarily for higher self-insured healthcare benefit costs and occupancy costs.\nLegal and related expenses were $6.7 million during the 2020 period compared to $3.0 million in the 2019 period, an increase of $3.7 million. During the 2020 period, we incurred $4.1 million for contested proxy costs relating to our February 2020 annual shareholders meeting. Third-party payers, including government programs, may decide to deny payment or recoup payments for testing that they contend was improperly billed or not medically necessary, against their coverage determinations, or for which they believe they have otherwise overpaid (including as a result of their own error), and we may be required to refund payments already received. During the third fiscal quarter of 2019, a significant third-party payer informed us outside of their typical business practice that they believed it overpaid us during certain periods of fiscal 2018. We disputed these claims and sent legal appeal letters to the payer. In the 2020 period, we recorded $0.8 million in legal and related expenses as a result of reduced reimbursements this payer made to us. In the third quarter of the 2020 period, we and the payer entered into a settlement agreement and release whereby the parties agrees that the $0.8 million previously withheld by the payer fully and completely satisfied the dispute. Legal expense associated with other legal activity including costs associated with on-going litigation and contract disputes decreased $1.2 million due to the timing of activities.\nLegal settlements, net were $28.9 million in the 2019 period versus none in the 2020 period. During the 2019 period the Company as plaintiff finalized and executed settlement agreements with Roche ($19.4 million, net), and Hologic Inc. ($9.5 million, net).\nInterest income, net was $0.5 million in the 2020 period and $1.1 million in the 2019 period and represents interest on cash and cash equivalents net of interest expense. During the 2020 period, the amount of investable cash was lower as were interest rates earned on deposits. Due to the actions by the Federal Reserve to cut its target interest rates near zero in response to COVID-19, we expect there will be substantially no interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents for the foreseeable future.\nThe foreign currency revaluation gain recognized by the Life Sciences Products segment during the 2020 period was $0.9 million compared to a loss of $0.7 million in the 2019 period, a favorable variance of $1.6 million. The gain was due to year over year appreciation of the British pound and Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar as of the end of the 2020 period, compared to their year over year depreciation as of the end of the 2019 period.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal year ended July 31, 2019 compared to July 31, 2018\n(in 000s)\n\n** not meaningful\nConsolidated Results:\nThe 2019 period\u201d and the 2018 period\u201d refer to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nClinical services revenues for the 2019 period were $51.1 million compared to $71.1 million in the 2018 period, a decrease of $20.0 million or 28%. Services revenues were negatively affected by lower genetics testing volume approximating $8.8 million, attributable to increased competition. Services revenues were negatively affected by lower reimbursement rates of $9.8 million, of which $6.4 million is attributable to reduced genetics testing reimbursements as a result of an increase in denial rates and changes to medical and procedural requirements, and $3.4 million attributable to reimbursement rate declines from third party payers and the impact from the Protecting Access to Medicare Act ( PAMA\u201d). During the 2019 period, adjustments to estimated collection amounts from third party payers and HMO's also decreased services revenues by $1.4 million. Total diagnostic testing volume measured by the number of accessions decreased approximately 1%. In the normal course of business, estimated collection amounts are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of third party payer billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as issues unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, and require us to consider the potential for adjustments when estimating variable consideration in the recognition of revenue in the period that the related services are rendered.\nProduct revenues for the 2019 and 2018 periods was $30.1 million compared to $29.2 during 2018. The increase of $0.9 million or 3% is due to higher product order volume in the U.S. market, which was partially offset by lower product order volume in the international market and the negative impact of foreign exchange translation. There was no royalty income in the 2019 period as the license agreement expired during the 2018 period. Royalty income in 2018 period was $0.7 million.\nThe cost of Clinical Services during the 2019 period was $44.2 million as compared to $46.0 million in the 2018 period, a decrease of $1.8 million or 4% primarily due to the change in test mix, especially the decline in genetic testing volume. The components of the decrease are $3.1 million from a decrease in outside reference lab genetic testing costs, partially offset by increases in reagent and other test supplies of $0.7 million and compensation related expenses of $0.6 million.\nThe cost of product revenues was $13.7 million in the 2019 period and $14.4 million in the 2018 period, a decrease of $0.6 million or 4% due to due to the mix of products sold and a decrease in compensation expense. The gross profit margin on products was 54.4% in the 2019 period and 51.0% in the 2018 period. The 2019 improvement was due to favorable mix of products sold and lower discounting.\nResearch and development expenses were $3.2 million in the 2019 and 2018 periods. The expense for Life Sciences Products was $2.2 million for the 2019 period and $2.3 million for the 2018 period. The expense for Enzo Therapeutics was $0.9 million in both periods.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $44.3 million during the 2019 period versus $44.5 million during the 2018 period, a decrease of $0.2 million. Clinical Services expense decreased $0.4 million, primarily due to a $0.8 million reduction in outside billing and collections expenses, partially offset by increased costs to nationally market our new molecular diagnostic products for use by other reference labs of approximately $0.2 million, increased information technology costs to support our clients of $0.1 million, and increased office rent and utility costs of $0.1 million. Life Sciences Products expense increased $0.2 million due to higher business development salaries and related costs. Other segment expense remained the same during both periods.\nLegal fee expense was $3.0 million during the 2019 period compared to $5.1 million in the 2018 period, a decrease of $2.1 million due to the timing of legal activity and related costs associated with on-going litigation and contract dispute where the Company is the plaintiff.\nLegal settlements, net were $28.9 million in the 2019 period versus none in the 2018 period. During the 2019 period the Company as plaintiff finalized and executed settlement agreements with Roche ($19.4 million, net), and Hologic Inc. ($9.5 million, net).\nInterest income, net increased $0.2 million in the 2019 period due to increased interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalents.\nThe foreign currency loss incurred by the Life Sciences Products segment during the 2019 period was $0.7 million compared to $0.3 million in the 2018 period, an unfavorable variance of $0.4 million. During the 2019 period, there were greater revaluation losses due to the significant depreciation of the British pound and Euro versus the U.S. dollar compared to that of the 2018 period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt July 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $47.9 million of which $0.9 million was in foreign accounts, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $60.1 million, of which $0.7 million was in foreign accounts at July 31, 2019. It is the Company's current intent to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States, and its current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund its United States operations. The Company had working capital of $36.0 million at July 31, 2020 compared to $65.4 million at July 31, 2019. The decrease in working capital of $29.4 million was primarily due to the recognition of $28.5 million in net loss for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020.\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2020 was approximately $17.2 million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $4.8 million in fiscal 2019, an increase in net cash used in operations of approximately $22.0 million. This increase in net cash used in operating activities in the 2020 period versus 2019 was due to the year over year increase of $31.0 million in net loss, partially by a positive net change in adjustments and operating assets and liabilities of $9.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 was approximately $4.8 million as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2.7 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of approximately $7.5 million. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the 2019 period versus the 2018 period was primarily due to an increase in net income of $12.8 million derived from legal settlements reached in the 2019 period, offset by a net change in adjustments and operating assets and liabilities of $5.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was approximately $2.2 million as compared to $8.1 million in the 2019 period, a decrease of $5.9 million. The decrease in the 2020 period is primarily due to the impact in 2019 of the purchase of a facility in that period. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 was approximately $8.1 million as compared to $1.9 million in the 2018 period, an increase of $6.2 million. The increase in the 2019 period is primarily due to the purchase of our new facility.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020 was approximately $7.0 million as compared to $4.2 million in fiscal 2019. The increase of $2.8 million was primarily due to proceeds from the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loan. The PPP loan bears interest of 1% per annum. All or a portion of the PPP Loan, including interest, could be forgiven by the SBA by applying for forgiveness and providing acceptable documentation that demonstrates the funds were used as required by the terms of forgiveness and in accordance with the SBA's requirements. Due to complexities with respect to loan forgiveness calculations and government pronouncements with respect to expenditure eligibility, we did not recognize any loan forgiveness as of July 31, 2020 and have classified the loan as other short term debt as we expect to earn loan forgiveness on most, if not all of the loan in less than a year. See Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2019 was approximately $4.2 million as compared to cash provided of $0.6 million in fiscal 2018. The 2019 increase of $3.6 million was due to proceeds from a ten year mortgage agreement entered into for the purchase of our new facility, which bears a fixed interest rate of 5.09% per annum and requires monthly mortgage payments of $30. The Company's obligations under the mortgage agreement are secured by the new facility and by a $750 cash collateral deposit with the mortgagee as additional security. This restricted cash is included in other assets as of July 31, 2020. As of July 31, 2020, the Company was not in compliance with a financial ratio covenant related to this mortgage. Effective October 19, 2020, the Company and the mortgagee agreed to a covenant restructure whereby the mortgagee waived the Company's financial ratio covenant for the fiscal period ended July 31, 2020 and modified the mortgage to replace that covenant with a liquidity covenant. The liquidity covenant requires that we own and maintain at all times and throughout the remaining term of the loan at least $25 million of liquid assets, defined as time deposits, money market accounts and obligations issued by the U.S. government or any of its agencies. The cash collateral agreement was also modified to require compliance with the liquidity covenant for two consecutive fiscal years before the collateral is released back to us.\nThe Company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents level, and utilization of the Controlled Equity Offering program if necessary, as disclosed in Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are sufficient for its foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs over at least the next twelve (12) months, although there can be no assurance that future events will not alter such view. Although there can be no assurances, in the event additional capital is required, the Company believes it has the ability to raise additional funds through equity offerings or other sources. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d section of this Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2020, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans.\nEffect of New Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn August 1, 2019, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) on accounting for leases using the modified retrospective method. This new accounting standard requires a lessee to recognize an asset and liability for most leases on its balance sheet. The Company elected the optional transition method that allowed for a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings recorded on August 1, 2019 and did not restate previously reported results in the comparative periods. The Company also elected the package of practical expedients, which among other things, allowed it to carry forward its historical lease classification.\nAs a result of adoption of the new standard, the Company recorded right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of approximately $24.4 million and $25.1 million, respectively as of August 1, 2019. The operating lease liability was determined based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments and the right-of-use asset was determined based on the value of the lease liability, adjusted for deferred rent balances of approximately $0.7 million, which were previously included in accrued expenses. There was no cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. Accounting for the Company's finance leases remains substantially unchanged. The adoption of the new standard did not materially impact the Company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows. The adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in increased qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.\nThe Company elected the package of three practical expedients. As such, the Company did not reassess whether expired or existing contracts are or contain a lease and did not need to reassess the lease classifications or reassess the initial direct costs associated with expired or existing leases. The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient. Further, the land easement practical expedient was not elected as the practical expedient is not applicable to the Company. The Company elected to take the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components of all asset classes entered into or modified after the effective date. For further details, see Note 9 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements\nOn August 1, 2018, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by FASB on revenue recognition using the full retrospective method. This new accounting standard outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. This standard supersedes existing revenue recognition requirements and eliminates most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The core principle of the revenue recognition standard is to require an entity to recognize as revenue the amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to be entitled to when control of goods or services are transferred to its customers.\nAs a result of the Company's adoption of this standard, the majority of the amounts that were historically classified as bad debt expense, primarily related to patient responsibility, are now considered an implicit price concession in determining net revenues from clinical services. Accordingly, the Company reports estimated uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction of the transaction price and therefore as a reduction in net revenues, when historically these amounts were classified and separately reported as a provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The adoption of this standard has no impact on revenues reported for life sciences products. The adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in increased disclosure, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. For further details, see Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe impact of the adoption of the standard on prior period consolidated operations, cash flows and balance sheet is presented in the table below:\n\nOn August 1, 2018, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by FASB which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. Adoption of this standard requires that amendments in the update be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. For the foreseeable future, any excess income tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation, which would be recognized as discrete items within income tax expense rather than additional paid in capital, will be offset by an equivalent adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance. Accordingly, adoption of this standard had no impact on our reported operations.\nPronouncements Issued but Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This standard, as amended, changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including trade receivables, from an incurred loss method to a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses. The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adoption of this standard is required for our annual and interim periods beginning August 1, 2023, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe reviewed all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and have concluded they are not applicable or not expected to be significant to the accounting for our operations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has entered into various real estate and equipment operating leases, reagent rental agreements, and employment agreements with certain executive officers. The real estate lease for the Company's Farmingdale Clinical Lab and Research facility is with a related party. See Item 2, Properties, and Note 9 and Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of these leases and obligations.\nManagement is not aware of any material claims, disputes or settled matters concerning third-party reimbursements that would have a material effect on our financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements\u201d as such term is defined in Item 303(a) (4) of Regulation S-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Enzo Biochem, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOn an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to contractual expense, allowance for uncollectible accounts, inventory, intangible assets and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nContingencies\nContingencies are evaluated in accordance with ASC 450-20, Contingencies, and a liability is recorded when the matter is both probable and reasonably estimable. Gain contingencies are evaluated and not recognized until the gain is realizable or realized.\nProduct revenues and royalty income\nProducts revenues consist of the sale of single-use products used in the identification of genomic information and are recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Payment terms for shipments to end-user and distributor customers may range from 30 to 90 days. Any claims for credit or return of goods may be made generally within 30 days of receipt. Revenues are reduced to reflect estimated credits and returns, although historically these adjustments have not been material. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue, while the related shipping and handling costs are reflected in cost of products.\nRoyalty income is based on net sales of the Company's licensed products by a third party. We recognize royalty income in the period the sales occur based on third party evidence received\nRevenues - Clinical laboratory services\nNet revenues in the Company's clinical services business are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions. The services business, which provides clinical testing services, satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenues upon completion of the testing process for a specific patient and reporting to the ordering physician. The Company may also perform clinical testing services for other laboratories and will recognize revenue from those services when reported to the ordering laboratory. The Company estimates the amount of consideration it expects to receive from customer groups using the portfolio approach. These estimates of the expected consideration include the impact of contractual allowances and price concessions on our customer group portfolios consisting of healthcare insurers, government payers, client payers and patients. Contracts with customers in our laboratory services business do not contain a financing component, based on the typically limited period of time between performance of services and collection of consideration. The transaction price includes variable consideration in the form of the contractual allowance and price concessions as well as the collectability of the transaction based on patient intent and ability to pay. The Company uses the expected value method in estimating the amount of the variability included in the transaction price.\nContractual Adjustment\nThe Company's estimate of contractual adjustment is based on significant assumptions and judgments, such as its interpretation of payer reimbursement policies, and bears the risk of change. The estimation process is based on the experience of amounts approved as reimbursable and ultimately settled by payers, versus the corresponding gross amount billed to the respective payers. The contractual adjustment is an estimate that reduces gross revenue based on gross billing rates to amounts expected to be approved and reimbursed. Gross billings are based on a standard fee schedule we set for all third party payers, including Medicare, health maintenance organizations ( HMO's\u201d) and managed care. The Company adjusts the contractual adjustment estimate quarterly, based on its evaluation of current and historical settlement experience with payers, industry reimbursement trends, and other relevant factors. The other relevant factors that affect our contractual adjustment include the monthly and quarterly review of: 1) current gross billings and receivables and reimbursement by payer, 2) current changes in third party arrangements and 3) the growth of in-network provider arrangements and managed care plans specific to our Company.\nOur clinical laboratory services business is primarily dependent upon reimbursement from third-party payers, such as Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and insurers. We are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant changes of reimbursement rates. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage would negatively impact our revenues. The number of individuals covered under managed care contracts or other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future. In addition, Medicare and other government healthcare programs continue to shift to managed care. These trends will continue to reduce our revenues.\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the contractual adjustment percentages, determined using current and historical reimbursement statistics, were approximately 88%, 88% and 85%, respectively, of gross billings. The Company believes a decline in reimbursement rates or a shift to managed care, or similar arrangements may be offset by the positive impact of an increase in the number of tests we perform. However, there can be no assurance that we can increase the number of tests we perform or that if we do increase the number of tests we perform, that we can maintain that higher number of tests performed, or that an increase in the number of tests we perform would result in increased revenue.\nThe Company estimates (by using a sensitivity analysis) that each 1% point change in the contractual adjustment percentage could result in a change in clinical laboratory services revenues of approximately $3.9 million, $4.4 million, and $5.0 million, for the years ended July 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and a change in the net accounts receivable of approximately $0.5 and $0.4 million as of July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur clinical laboratory financial billing system records gross billings using a standard fee schedule for all payers and does not record contractual adjustment by payer at the time of billing. Therefore, we are unable to quantify the effect of contractual adjustment recorded during the current period that relate to revenue recorded in a previous period. However, we can reasonably estimate our monthly contractual adjustment to revenue on a timely basis based on our quarterly review process, which includes:\n\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which is estimated and recorded in the period of the related revenue.\nThe following is a table of the Company's net accounts receivable by segment. The Clinical Laboratory Services segment's net receivables are detailed by billing category and as a percent to its total net receivables. As of July 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 68% and 63% respectively, of the Company's net accounts receivable relates to its Clinical Laboratory Services business, which operates in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut medical communities. The Life Sciences products segment's accounts receivable includes approximately $1.0 million or 34% and $1.2 million or 32% of foreign receivables as of July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet accounts receivable (in thousands)\n\nThe Company's ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payers is critical to its operating performance and cash flows. The primary collection risk lies with uninsured patients or patients for whom primary insurance has paid but a patient portion remains outstanding. The Company also assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact, if any, on the allowance estimates, which involves judgment. The Company believes that the collectability of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes, most notably, those related to obtaining the accurate patient information in order to bill effectively for the services provided. Should circumstances change (e.g. shift in payer mix, decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of receivables), our estimates of net realizable value of receivables could be reduced by a material amount. As of July 31, 2020, approximately 11% of Clinical Labs receivables are from one payer.\nBilling for laboratory services is complicated because of many factors, especially: the differences between our standard gross fee schedule for all payers and the reimbursement rates of the various payers we deal with, disparity of coverage and information requirements among the various payers, and disputes with payers as to which party is responsible for reimbursement.\nThe following tables indicate the Clinical Laboratory Services segment aged gross receivables for the periods indicated by payer group (in thousands), which is prior to adjustment to gross receivables for: 1) contractual adjustment, 2) fully reserved balances not yet written off, and 3) other revenue adjustments.\n\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSee in this Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 Part 1. Item 1. Business, for Forward Looking Cautionary Statements.\nThe Company's Enzo Clinical Laboratory Services and Enzo Life Sciences Products reporting units, as described below, are affected by different US and global economic conditions which are included in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nWith the coronavirus pandemic affecting people on a regional and global basis, the Company launched a rapid response to market demand for COVID-19 testing products and services. Enzo is delivering testing and lab services to schools, institutions, urgent care facilities, and core multi-state network of medical practices. Furthermore, the Company's GENFLEX\u2122 platform received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July for its proprietary product for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. FDA EUA demonstrates the Company's unique integrated in-house capability in developing low cost, high throughput sensitive detection platforms for COVID-19 as well as other diseases. The Authorization was for a comprehensive platform enabling rapid scalability of testing, including internal use within Enzo's Clinical Lab as well as for the sale of instrumentation, consumables, and reagents to other diagnostic testing customers. The Authorization includes three diverse platforms: Enzo's proprietary GENFLEX\u2122 automated high-throughput platform, a medium-throughput industry standard platform, and Enzo's manual workflow. Launching a COVID-19 test on its proprietary GENFLEX \u2122 molecular diagnostics platform serves as representative of the Company's capabilities as it develops other tests on the platform including an upper respiratory panel, STDs and expanded women's health panels. The Company is well positioned to replicate this success in response to new emerging health issues and needs, including, but not limited to, upper respiratory, sexually transmitted diseases, viral load, and women's health.\nWe are comprised of three operating companies that have evolved out of our core competence: the use of nucleic acids as informational molecules and the use of compounds for immune modulation. These wholly-owned operating companies and the foreign subsidiaries of Enzo Life Sciences conduct their operations through three reportable segments. Below are brief descriptions of each of the three operating segments (see Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements):\nEnzo Clinical Laboratory Services is a regional clinical laboratory serving the greater New York and New Jersey medical communities and expanding into Connecticut. The Company believes having clinical diagnostic services allows us to capitalize first hand on our extensive advanced molecular and cytogenetic capabilities and the broader trends in predictive and personalized diagnostics. We offer a menu of routine and esoteric clinical laboratory tests or procedures used in general patient care by physicians to establish or support a diagnosis, monitor treatment or medication, or search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition. We operate a full-service clinical laboratory in Farmingdale, New York, a network of 34 patient service centers throughout greater New York and New Jersey, a free-standing STAT\u201d or rapid response laboratories in New York City and Connecticut, and a full-service phlebotomy center and an in-house logistics department. Payments for clinical laboratory testing services are made by the Medicare program, healthcare insurers and patients.\nThe Clinical Laboratory Services reporting unit is impacted by various risk factors, including among others, reduced reimbursements from third party payers for testing performed and from recent health care legislation. Despite the growth we have experienced in previous years, there can be no assurance future growth can be achieved. The introduction of new molecular and esoteric tests is expected to increase our revenue per test and could offset impacts from the above factors. The Company anticipates improved profitability with increased service volume.\nEnzo Life Sciences Products manufactures, develops and markets products and tools to life sciences, drug development and clinical research customers world-wide and has amassed a large patent and technology portfolio. Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. is a recognized leader in labeling and detection technologies across research and diagnostic markets. Our strong portfolio of proteins, antibodies, peptides, small molecules, labeling probes, dyes and kits provides life science researchers tools for target identification/validation, high content analysis, gene expression analysis, nucleic acid detection, protein biochemistry and detection, and cellular analysis. We are globally recognized and acknowledged as a leader in manufacturing, in-licensing, and commercialization of over 40,000 products. Our strategic focus is directed to innovative high quality research reagents and kits in the primary key research areas of genomics, immunohistochemistry, immunoassays, cellular analysis, and small molecule chemistry. The segment is an established source for a comprehensive panel of products to scientific experts in the fields of cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, diabetes and obesity, endocrine disorders, infectious and autoimmune disease, hepatotoxicity and renal injury.\nEnzo Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical venture that has developed multiple novel approaches in the areas of gastrointestinal, infectious, ophthalmic and metabolic diseases, many of which are derived from the pioneering work of Enzo Life Sciences. The Company has focused its efforts on developing treatment regimens for diseases and conditions in which current treatment options are ineffective, costly, and/or cause unwanted side effects. This focus has generated a clinical and preclinical pipeline, as well as more than 100 patents and patent applications.\nThe following table summarizes the sources of revenues for the fiscal years

period\u201d refer to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nClinical services revenues for the 2020 period were $49.5 million compared to $51.1 million in the 2019 period, a decrease of $1.6 million or 3%. Revenues for the 2020 period include two CARES Act Relief Payment grants totaling $1.5 million. Due to COVID-19, diagnostic testing volume measured by the total number of accessions for all our testing services decreased 7% period over period, resulting in the 2020 period's revenue decrease. COVID-19 testing services provided in the four months of the 2020 period partially offset the impact of the decline in total testing volume and also contributed to liquidation rate improvement. In the latter part of our third quarter, while accessions had not returned to prior year levels, we started to see accession volume rebound. Due to the addition of COVID-19 testing, accession volume in the month of July 2020 exceeded July 2019 volume. In the normal course of business, estimated collection amounts are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of third party payer billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as issues unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, and require us to consider the potential for adjustments when estimating variable consideration in the recognition of revenue in the period that the related services are rendered. The impact from the Protecting Access to Medicare Act ( PAMA\u201d) continues to negatively impact reimbursements from Medicare and third party payers.\nProduct revenues for the 2020 and 2019 periods were $26.6 million and $30.1 million, respectively. The decrease of $3.5 million or 12% is the result of the policies and initiatives ordered by national and local governments designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. The negative effect of these government policies on our products revenues was greater in the U.S. market than markets in the rest of the world, and began in the latter half of the third quarter of the 2020 period.\nThe cost of Clinical Services was $38.9 million in the 2020 period and $44.2 million in the 2019 period, a decrease of $5.3 million, attributable to the overall decline in testing volume, resulting in reduction in reagent usage and outside reference testing expense. The gross profit margin on Clinical Services revenues, excluding the grants in the 2020 period, was 19.0% in the 2020 period and 13.4% in the 2019 period. In the 2020 period, liquidation rate improvements and the higher margin on COVID-19 testing helped to offset the effect of reduced volumes of our genetics and core testing services.\nThe cost of product revenues was $13.4 million in the 2020 period and $13.7 million in the 2019 period, a decrease of $0.3 million or 2% due to the decrease in revenues. The gross profit margin on products was 49.6% in the 2020 period and 54.4% in the 2019 period, negatively impacted by the decline of higher margin sales in the U.S. market from COVID-19.\nResearch and development expenses were $4.4 million in the 2020 period and $3.2 million in the 2019 period, an increase of $1.2 million or 38%. The increase is entirely attributed to the Clinical Services division for lab developed tests (LDTs) including those based on our proprietary GENFLEX\u2122 platform. During the 2020 period, our research was focused on lab developed tests for the detection of COVID-19 and for the detection of COVID-19 antibodies. Our lab developed test for the detection of COVID-19 was approved under the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority. Other tests based on GENFLEX\u2122 were approved by The New York State Department of Health.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $43.0 million during the 2020 period versus $44.3 million during the 2019 period, a decrease of $1.3 million or 3%. The Clinical Services expense decreased $0.7 million due to cost savings initiatives and lower commissions. The Life Sciences Products expense decreased $1.4 million due to reductions in sales, marketing and administrative salaries and related costs, travel expenses, and intangibles amortization. The other segment increased $0.8 million primarily for higher self-insured healthcare benefit costs and occupancy costs.\nLegal and related expenses were $6.7 million during the 2020 period compared to $3.0 million in the 2019 period, an increase of $3.7 million. During the 2020 period, we incurred $4.1 million for contested proxy costs relating to our February 2020 annual shareholders meeting. Third-party payers, including government programs, may decide to deny payment or recoup payments for testing that they contend was improperly billed or not medically necessary, against their coverage determinations, or for which they believe they have otherwise overpaid (including as a result of their own error), and we may be required to refund payments already received. During the third fiscal quarter of 2019, a significant third-party payer informed us outside of their typical business practice that they believed it overpaid us during certain periods of fiscal 2018. We disputed these claims and sent legal appeal letters to the payer. In the 2020 period, we recorded $0.8 million in legal and related expenses as a result of reduced reimbursements this payer made to us. In the third quarter of the 2020 period, we and the payer entered into a settlement agreement and release whereby the parties agrees that the $0.8 million previously withheld by the payer fully and completely satisfied the dispute. Legal expense associated with other legal activity including costs associated with on-going litigation and contract disputes decreased $1.2 million due to the timing of activities.\nLegal settlements, net were $28.9 million in the 2019 period versus none in the 2020 period. During the 2019 period the Company as plaintiff finalized and executed settlement agreements with Roche ($19.4 million, net), and Hologic Inc. ($9.5 million, net).\nInterest income, net was $0.5 million in the 2020 period and $1.1 million in the 2019 period and represents interest on cash and cash equivalents net of interest expense. During the 2020 period, the amount of investable cash was lower as were interest rates earned on deposits. Due to the actions by the Federal Reserve to cut its target interest rates near zero in response to COVID-19, we expect there will be substantially no interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents for the foreseeable future.\nThe foreign currency revaluation gain recognized by the Life Sciences Products segment during the 2020 period was $0.9 million compared to a loss of $0.7 million in the 2019 period, a favorable variance of $1.6 million. The gain was due to year over year appreciation of the British pound and Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar as of the end of the 2020 period, compared to their year over year depreciation as of the end of the 2019 period.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal year ended July 31, 2019 compared to July 31, 2018\n(in 000s)\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>Comparative Financial Data for the Fiscal Years Ended

services revenues for the 2019 period were $51.1 million compared to $71.1 million in the 2018 period, a decrease of $20.0 million or 28%. Services revenues were negatively affected by lower genetics testing volume approximating $8.8 million, attributable to increased competition. Services revenues were negatively affected by lower reimbursement rates of $9.8 million, of which $6.4 million is attributable to reduced genetics testing reimbursements as a result of an increase in denial rates and changes to medical and procedural requirements, and $3.4 million attributable to reimbursement rate declines from third party payers and the impact from the Protecting Access to Medicare Act ( PAMA\u201d). During the 2019 period, adjustments to estimated collection amounts from third party payers and HMO's also decreased services revenues by $1.4 million. Total diagnostic testing volume measured by the number of accessions decreased approximately 1%. In the normal course of business, estimated collection amounts are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of third party payer billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as issues unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, and require us to consider the potential for adjustments when estimating variable consideration in the recognition of revenue in the period that the related services are rendered.\nProduct revenues for the 2019 and 2018 periods was $30.1 million compared to $29.2 during 2018. The increase of $0.9 million or 3% is due to higher product order volume in the U.S. market, which was partially offset by lower product order volume in the international market and the negative impact of foreign exchange translation. There was no royalty income in the 2019 period as the license agreement expired during the 2018 period. Royalty income in 2018 period was $0.7 million.\nThe cost of Clinical Services during the 2019 period was $44.2 million as compared to $46.0 million in the 2018 period, a decrease of $1.8 million or 4% primarily due to the change in test mix, especially the decline in genetic testing volume. The components of the decrease are $3.1 million from a decrease in outside reference lab genetic testing costs, partially offset by increases in reagent and other test supplies of $0.7 million and compensation related expenses of $0.6 million.\nThe cost of product revenues was $13.7 million in the 2019 period and $14.4 million in the 2018 period, a decrease of $0.6 million or 4% due to due to the mix of products sold and a decrease in compensation expense. The gross profit margin on products was 54.4% in the 2019 period and 51.0% in the 2018 period. The 2019 improvement was due to favorable mix of products sold and lower discounting.\nResearch and development expenses were $3.2 million in the 2019 and 2018 periods. The expense for Life Sciences Products was $2.2 million for the 2019 period and $2.3 million for the 2018 period. The expense for Enzo Therapeutics was $0.9 million in both periods.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $44.3 million during the 2019 period versus $44.5 million during the 2018 period, a decrease of $0.2 million. Clinical Services expense decreased $0.4 million, primarily due to a $0.8 million reduction in outside billing and collections expenses, partially offset by increased costs to nationally market our new molecular diagnostic products for use by other reference labs of approximately $0.2 million, increased information technology costs to support our clients of $0.1 million, and increased office rent and utility costs of $0.1 million. Life Sciences Products expense increased $0.2 million due to higher business development salaries and related costs. Other segment expense remained the same during both periods.\nLegal fee expense was $3.0 million during the 2019 period compared to $5.1 million in the 2018 period, a decrease of $2.1 million due to the timing of legal activity and related costs associated with on-going litigation and contract dispute where the Company is the plaintiff.\nLegal settlements, net were $28.9 million in the 2019 period versus none in the 2018 period. During the 2019 period the Company as plaintiff finalized and executed settlement agreements with Roche ($19.4 million, net), and Hologic Inc. ($9.5 million, net).\nInterest income, net increased $0.2 million in the 2019 period due to increased interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalents.\nThe foreign currency loss incurred by the Life Sciences Products segment during the 2019 period was $0.7 million compared to $0.3 million in the 2018 period, an unfavorable variance of $0.4 million. During the 2019 period, there were greater revaluation losses due to the significant depreciation of the British pound and Euro versus the U.S. dollar compared to that of the 2018 period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt July 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $47.9 million of which $0.9 million was in foreign accounts, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $60.1 million, of which $0.7 million was in foreign accounts at July 31, 2019. It is the Company's current intent to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States, and its current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund its United States operations. The Company had working capital of $36.0 million at July 31, 2020 compared to $65.4 million at July 31, 2019. The decrease in working capital of $29.4 million was primarily due to the recognition of $28.5 million in net loss for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020.\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2020 was approximately $17.2 million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $4.8 million in fiscal 2019, an increase in net cash used in operations of approximately $22.0 million. This increase in net cash used in operating activities in the 2020 period versus 2019 was due to the year over year increase of $31.0 million in net loss, partially by a positive net change in adjustments and operating assets and liabilities of $9.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 was approximately $4.8 million as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2.7 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of approximately $7.5 million. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the 2019 period versus the 2018 period was primarily due to an increase in net income of $12.8 million derived from legal settlements reached in the 2019 period, offset by a net change in adjustments and operating assets and liabilities of $5.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was approximately $2.2 million as compared to $8.1 million in the 2019 period, a decrease of $5.9 million. The decrease in the 2020 period is primarily due to the impact in 2019 of the purchase of a facility in that period. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 was approximately $8.1 million as compared to $1.9 million in the 2018 period, an increase of $6.2 million. The increase in the 2019 period is primarily due to the purchase of our new facility.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020 was approximately $7.0 million as compared to $4.2 million in fiscal 2019. The increase of $2.8 million was primarily due to proceeds from the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loan. The PPP loan bears interest of 1% per annum. All or a portion of the PPP Loan, including interest, could be forgiven by the SBA by applying for forgiveness and providing acceptable documentation that demonstrates the funds were used as required by the terms of forgiveness and in accordance with the SBA's requirements. Due to complexities with respect to loan forgiveness calculations and government pronouncements with respect to expenditure eligibility, we did not recognize any loan forgiveness as of July 31, 2020 and have classified the loan as other short term debt as we expect to earn loan forgiveness on most, if not all of the loan in less than a year. See Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2019 was approximately $4.2 million as compared to cash provided of $0.6 million in fiscal 2018. The 2019 increase of $3.6 million was due to proceeds from a ten year mortgage agreement entered into for the purchase of our new facility, which bears a fixed interest rate of 5.09% per annum and requires monthly mortgage payments of $30. The Company's obligations under the mortgage agreement are secured by the new facility and by a $750 cash collateral deposit with the mortgagee as additional security. This restricted cash is included in other assets as of July 31, 2020. As of July 31, 2020, the Company was not in compliance with a financial ratio covenant related to this mortgage. Effective October 19, 2020, the Company and the mortgagee agreed to a covenant restructure whereby the mortgagee waived the Company's financial ratio covenant for the fiscal period ended July 31, 2020 and modified the mortgage to replace that covenant with a liquidity covenant. The liquidity covenant requires that we own and maintain at all times and throughout the remaining term of the loan at least $25 million of liquid assets, defined as time deposits, money market accounts and obligations issued by the U.S. government or any of its agencies. The cash collateral agreement was also modified to require compliance with the liquidity covenant for two consecutive fiscal years before the collateral is released back to us.\nThe Company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents level, and utilization of the Controlled Equity Offering program if necessary, as disclosed in Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are sufficient for its foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs over at least the next twelve (12) months, although there can be no assurance that future events will not alter such view. Although there can be no assurances, in the event additional capital is required, the Company believes it has the ability to raise additional funds through equity offerings or other sources. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d section of this Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2020, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans.\nEffect of New Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn August 1, 2019, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) on accounting for leases using the modified retrospective method. This new accounting standard requires a lessee to recognize an asset and liability for most leases on its balance sheet. The Company elected the optional transition method that allowed for a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings recorded on August 1, 2019 and did not restate previously reported results in the comparative periods. The Company also elected the package of practical expedients, which among other things, allowed it to carry forward its historical lease classification.\nAs a result of adoption of the new standard, the Company recorded right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of approximately $24.4 million and $25.1 million, respectively as of August 1, 2019. The operating lease liability was determined based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments and the right-of-use asset was determined based on the value of the lease liability, adjusted for deferred rent balances of approximately $0.7 million, which were previously included in accrued expenses. There was no cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. Accounting for the Company's finance leases remains substantially unchanged. The adoption of the new standard did not materially impact the Company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows. The adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in increased qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.\nThe Company elected the package of three practical expedients. As such, the Company did not reassess whether expired or existing contracts are or contain a lease and did not need to reassess the lease classifications or reassess the initial direct costs associated with expired or existing leases. The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient. Further, the land easement practical expedient was not elected as the practical expedient is not applicable to the Company. The Company elected to take the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components of all asset classes entered into or modified after the effective date. For further details, see Note 9 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements\nOn August 1, 2018, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by FASB on revenue recognition using the full retrospective method. This new accounting standard outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. This standard supersedes existing revenue recognition requirements and eliminates most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The core principle of the revenue recognition standard is to require an entity to recognize as revenue the amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to be entitled to when control of goods or services are transferred to its customers.\nAs a result of the Company's adoption of this standard, the majority of the amounts that were historically classified as bad debt expense, primarily related to patient responsibility, are now considered an implicit price concession in determining net revenues from clinical services. Accordingly, the Company reports estimated uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction of the transaction price and therefore as a reduction in net revenues, when historically these amounts were classified and separately reported as a provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The adoption of this standard has no impact on revenues reported for life sciences products. The adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in increased disclosure, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. For further details, see Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe impact of the adoption of the standard on prior period consolidated operations, cash flows and balance sheet is presented in the table below:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended July 31, 2018: </td> <td> </td> <td>As Previously Reported </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Adjustment for New Accounting Standard on Revenue Recognition </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Reclassification of Residual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As Restated </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td> 3,700 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,700 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,455 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,321 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,321 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows July 31, 2018:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,700 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,775 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,915 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consolidated balance sheet July 31, 2018: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accounts receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,523 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,292 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Less: Allowance for doubtful accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,523 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,147 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 1, 2018, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by FASB which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. Adoption of this standard requires that amendments in the update be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. For the foreseeable future, any excess income tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation, which would be recognized as discrete items within income tax expense rather than additional paid in capital, will be offset by an equivalent adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance. Accordingly, adoption of this standard had no impact on our reported operations.\nPronouncements Issued but Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This standard, as amended, changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including trade receivables, from an incurred loss method to a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses. The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adoption of this standard is required for our annual and interim periods beginning August 1, 2023, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe reviewed all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and have concluded they are not applicable or not expected to be significant to the accounting for our operations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has entered into various real estate and equipment operating leases, reagent rental agreements, and employment agreements with certain executive officers. The real estate lease for the Company's Farmingdale Clinical Lab and Research facility is with a related party. See Item 2, Properties, and Note 9 and Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of these leases and obligations.\nManagement is not aware of any material claims, disputes or settled matters concerning third-party reimbursements that would have a material effect on our financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements\u201d as such term is defined in Item 303(a) (4) of Regulation S-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Enzo Biochem, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOn an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to contractual expense, allowance for uncollectible accounts, inventory, intangible assets and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nContingencies\nContingencies are evaluated in accordance with ASC 450-20, Contingencies, and a liability is recorded when the matter is both probable and reasonably estimable. Gain contingencies are evaluated and not recognized until the gain is realizable or realized.\nProduct revenues and royalty income\nProducts revenues consist of the sale of single-use products used in the identification of genomic information and are recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Payment terms for shipments to end-user and distributor customers may range from 30 to 90 days. Any claims for credit or return of goods may be made generally within 30 days of receipt. Revenues are reduced to reflect estimated credits and returns, although historically these adjustments have not been material. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue, while the related shipping and handling costs are reflected in cost of products.\nRoyalty income is based on net sales of the Company's licensed products by a third party. We recognize royalty income in the period the sales occur based on third party evidence received\nRevenues - Clinical laboratory services\nNet revenues in the Company's clinical services business are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions. The services business, which provides clinical testing services, satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenues upon completion of the testing process for a specific patient and reporting to the ordering physician. The Company may also perform clinical testing services for other laboratories and will recognize revenue from those services when reported to the ordering laboratory. The Company estimates the amount of consideration it expects to receive from customer groups using the portfolio approach. These estimates of the expected consideration include the impact of contractual allowances and price concessions on our customer group portfolios consisting of healthcare insurers, government payers, client payers and patients. Contracts with customers in our laboratory services business do not contain a financing component, based on the typically limited period of time between performance of services and collection of consideration. The transaction price includes variable consideration in the form of the contractual allowance and price concessions as well as the collectability of the transaction based on patient intent and ability to pay. The Company uses the expected value method in estimating the amount of the variability included in the transaction price.\nContractual Adjustment\nThe Company's estimate of contractual adjustment is based on significant assumptions and judgments, such as its interpretation of payer reimbursement policies, and bears the risk of change. The estimation process is based on the experience of amounts approved as reimbursable and ultimately settled by payers, versus the corresponding gross amount billed to the respective payers. The contractual adjustment is an estimate that reduces gross revenue based on gross billing rates to amounts expected to be approved and reimbursed. Gross billings are based on a standard fee schedule we set for all third party payers, including Medicare, health maintenance organizations ( HMO's\u201d) and managed care. The Company adjusts the contractual adjustment estimate quarterly, based on its evaluation of current and historical settlement experience with payers, industry reimbursement trends, and other relevant factors. The other relevant factors that affect our contractual adjustment include the monthly and quarterly review of: 1) current gross billings and receivables and reimbursement by payer, 2) current changes in third party arrangements and 3) the growth of in-network provider arrangements and managed care plans specific to our Company.\nOur clinical laboratory services business is primarily dependent upon reimbursement from third-party payers, such as Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and insurers. We are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant changes of reimbursement rates. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage would negatively impact our revenues. The number of individuals covered under managed care contracts or other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future. In addition, Medicare and other government healthcare programs continue to shift to managed care. These trends will continue to reduce our revenues.\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the contractual adjustment percentages, determined using current and historical reimbursement statistics, were approximately 88%, 88% and 85%, respectively, of gross billings. The Company believes a decline in reimbursement rates or a shift to managed care, or similar arrangements may be offset by the positive impact of an increase in the number of tests we perform. However, there can be no assurance that we can increase the number of tests we perform or that if we do increase the number of tests we perform, that we can maintain that higher number of tests performed, or that an increase in the number of tests we perform would result in increased revenue.\nThe Company estimates (by using a sensitivity analysis) that each 1% point change in the contractual adjustment percentage could result in a change in clinical laboratory services revenues of approximately $3.9 million, $4.4 million, and $5.0 million, for the years ended July 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and a change in the net accounts receivable of approximately $0.5 and $0.4 million as of July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur clinical laboratory financial billing system records gross billings using a standard fee schedule for all payers and does not record contractual adjustment by payer at the time of billing. Therefore, we are unable to quantify the effect of contractual adjustment recorded during the current period that relate to revenue recorded in a previous period. However, we can reasonably estimate our monthly contractual adjustment to revenue on a timely basis based on our quarterly review process, which includes:\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>an analysis of industry reimbursement trends; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>an evaluation of third-party reimbursement rates changes and changes in reimbursement arrangements with third-party payers; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>a rolling monthly analysis of current and historical claim settlement and reimbursement experience statistics with payers; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>an analysis of current gross billings and receivables by payer. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which is estimated and recorded in the period of the related revenue.\nThe following is a table of the Company's net accounts receivable by segment. The Clinical Laboratory Services segment's net receivables are detailed by billing category and as a percent to its total net receivables. As of July 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 68% and 63% respectively, of the Company's net accounts receivable relates to its Clinical Laboratory Services business, which operates in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut medical communities. The Life Sciences products segment's accounts receivable includes approximately $1.0 million or 34% and $1.2 million or 32% of foreign receivables as of July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet accounts receivable (in thousands)\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>July 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>July 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Clinical Labs (by billing category) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Third party payers </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Patient self-pay </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Medicare </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>HMO's </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Clinical Labs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Life Sciences </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total accounts receivable - net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payers is critical to its operating performance and cash flows. The primary collection risk lies with uninsured patients or patients for whom primary insurance has paid but a patient portion remains outstanding. The Company also assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact, if any, on the allowance estimates, which involves judgment. The Company believes that the collectability of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes, most notably, those related to obtaining the accurate patient information in order to bill effectively for the services provided. Should circumstances change (e.g. shift in payer mix, decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of receivables), our estimates of net realizable value of receivables could be reduced by a material amount. As of July 31, 2020, approximately 11% of Clinical Labs receivables are from one payer.\nBilling for laboratory services is complicated because of many factors, especially: the differences between our standard gross fee schedule for all payers and the reimbursement rates of the various payers we deal with, disparity of coverage and information requirements among the various payers, and disputes with payers as to which party is responsible for reimbursement.\nThe following tables indicate the Clinical Laboratory Services segment aged gross receivables for the periods indicated by payer group (in thousands), which is prior to adjustment to gross receivables for: 1) contractual adjustment, 2) fully reserved balances not yet written off, and 3) other revenue adjustments.\nTable 60: <table>
