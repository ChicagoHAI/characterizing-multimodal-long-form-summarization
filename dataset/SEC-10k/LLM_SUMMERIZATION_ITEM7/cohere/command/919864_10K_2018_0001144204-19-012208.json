Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Bancorp's earnings are dependent upon the earnings of the Bank. The Bank's earnings are primarily dependent upon net interest margin. The net interest margin is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings stated as a percentage of average interest earning assets. The net interest margin is perhaps the clearest indicator of a financial institution's ability to generate core earnings. Fees and service charges, wealth management operations income, gains and losses from the sale of assets, provisions for loan losses, income taxes and operating expenses also affect the Bancorp's profitability.\nA summary of the Bancorp's significant accounting policies are detailed in Note 1 to the Bancorp's consolidated financial statements included in this report. Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the disclosures provided. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates associated with the allowance for loan losses, fair values of foreclosed real estate, loan servicing rights, investment securities, deferred tax assets, goodwill, and the status of contingencies are particularly susceptible to material change in the near term.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Bancorp had total assets of $1.1 billion and total deposits of $929.8 million. The Bancorp's deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) that is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an agency of the federal government. At December 31, 2018, stockholders' equity totaled $101.5 million, with book value per share at $33.50. Net income for 2018 was $9.3 million, or $3.17 basic and diluted earnings per common share. The return on average assets was 0.93%, while the return on average stockholders' equity was 9.88%.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of First Personal Financial Corp. On July 26, 2018, the Bancorp completed its previously announced acquisition of First Personal Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation ( First Personal\u201d) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 20, 2018 (the First Personal Merger Agreement\u201d) between the Bancorp and First Personal. Pursuant to the terms of the First Personal Merger Agreement, First Personal merged with and into the Bancorp, with the Bancorp as the surviving corporation (the First Personal Merger\u201d). Simultaneous with the First Personal Merger, First Personal Bank, an Illinois state chartered commercial bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of First Personal, merged with and into Peoples Bank SB, with Peoples Bank as the surviving institution. The acquisition represented the Bank's first expansion into the South Suburban Chicagoland market, and expanded the Bank's full-service retail banking network to 19 banking centers.\nIn connection with the First Personal Merger, each First Personal stockholder holding 100 or more shares of First Personal common stock received fixed consideration of (i) 0.1246 shares of Bancorp common stock, and (ii) $6.67 per share in cash for each outstanding share of First Personal common stock. Stockholders holding less than 100 shares of First Personal common stock received $12.12 in cash and no stock consideration for each outstanding share of First Personal common stock. Any fractional shares of Bancorp common stock that a First Personal stockholder would have otherwise received in the First Personal Merger were cashed out in the amount of such fraction multiplied by $42.95.\nThe Bancorp issued a total of 161,875 shares of Bancorp common stock to the former First Personal stockholders, and paid cash consideration of approximately $8.7 million. Based upon the closing price of Bancorp's common stock on July 25, 2018, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately $15.6 million.\nAcquisition of AJS Bancorp, Inc. On January 24, 2019, the Bancorp completed its acquisition of AJS Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation ( AJSB\u201d), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 30, 2018 (the AJSB Merger Agreement\u201d) between the Bancorp and AJSB. Pursuant to the terms of the AJSB Merger Agreement, AJSB merged with and into the Bancorp, with the Bancorp as the surviving corporation (the AJSB Merger\u201d). Simultaneous with the AJSB Merger, A.J. Smith Federal Savings Bank, a federally chartered savings bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of AJSB, merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving institution.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>Page 34 of 91 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the AJSB Merger, each AJSB stockholder holding 100 or more shares of AJSB common stock received fixed consideration of (i) 0.2030 shares of the Bancorp common stock, and (ii) $7.20 per share in cash for each outstanding share of AJSB common stock. Stockholders holding less than 100 shares of AJSB common stock received $16.00 in cash and no stock consideration for each outstanding share of AJSB common stock. Any fractional shares of Bancorp common stock that an AJSB stockholder would have otherwise received in the AJSB Merger were cashed out in the amount of such fraction multiplied by $43.01.\nThe Bancorp issued 416,478 shares of Bancorp common stock to the former AJSB stockholders, and paid cash consideration of approximately $15.4 million. Based upon the closing price of the Bancorp's common stock on January 23, 2019, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately $34.2 million, which includes unallocated shares held by the AJSB Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP\u201d), some of which were cancelled in connection with the closing to satisfy the ESOP's outstanding loan balance. As a result of the acquisition, the Bank was able to further expand its retail banking network in the South Suburban Chicagoland market, bringing the total number of its full-service banking centers to 22.\nFinancial Condition\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, total assets increased by $168.9 million (18.2%), to $1.1 billion, with interest-earning assets increasing by $146.9 million (16.9%). At December 31, 2018, interest-earning assets totaled $1.0 billion and represented 92.9% of total assets. Loans totaled $764.4 million and represented 75.1% of interest-earning assets, 69.7% of total assets and 82.2% of total deposits. The loan portfolio, which is the Bancorp's largest asset, is a significant source of both interest and fee income.\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Loans </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>253,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multifamily </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans receivable </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>764,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 620,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustable rate loans / loans receivable </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>437,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>348,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans receivable to total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans receivable to earning assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans receivable to total deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bancorp is primarily a portfolio lender. Mortgage banking activities historically have been limited to the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans with contractual maturities greater than 15 years. These loans are identified as held for sale when originated and sold, on a loan-by-loan basis, in the secondary market. The Bancorp will also retain fixed rate mortgage loans with a contractual maturity greater than 15 years on a limited basis. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Bancorp originated $55.5 million in new fixed rate mortgage loans for sale, compared to $42.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Net gains realized from the mortgage loan sales totaled $1.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the Bancorp had $2.9 million in loans that were classified as held for sale, compared to $1.6 million at December 31, 2017.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>Page 35 of 91 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-performing loans include those loans that are 90 days or more past due and accruing and those loans that have been placed on non-accrual status. At December 31, 2018, all non-performing loans are also accounted for on a non-accrual basis, except for three commercial business loans totaling $149 thousand, one residential loan totaling $122 thousand and one home equity loan totaling $50 thousand that remained accruing and more than 90 days past due.\nThe Bancorp's nonperforming loans are summarized below:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,734 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>332 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multifamily </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>672 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,223 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nonperforming loans to total loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.90 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.84 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nonperforming loans to total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.56 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubstandard loans include non-performing loans and potential problem loans, where information about possible credit issues or other conditions causes management to question the ability of such borrowers to comply with loan covenants or repayment terms.

Typically, management does not individually classify smaller-balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgages or consumer loans, as impaired, unless they are troubled debt restructurings.\nPurchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date. Purchased loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination are considered purchased credit impaired loans. Expected future cash flows at the purchase date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable ( accretable yield\u201d). The difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference and represents probable losses in the portfolio. In determining the acquisition date fair value of purchased credit impaired loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Bancorp aggregates these purchased loans into pools of loans by common risk characteristics, such as credit risk rating and loan type. Subsequent to the purchase date, increases in cash flows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses.\nThe Bancorp's impaired loans, including purchased credit impaired loans, are summarized below:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,152 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>512 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multifamily </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>724 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,522 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt times, the Bancorp will modify the terms of a loan to forego a portion of interest or principal or reduce the interest rate on the loan to a rate materially less than market rates, or materially extend the maturity date of a loan as part of a troubled debt restructuring. The valuation basis for the Bancorp's troubled debt restructurings is based on the present value of expected future cash flows; unless consistent cash flows are not present, then the fair value of the collateral securing the loan is the basis for valuation.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>Page 37 of 91 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bancorp's troubled debt restructured loans are summarized below:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>303 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multifamily </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>535 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the troubled debt restructure loans reflected in the table above for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was the result of a $1.1 million commercial relationship as well as eight residential or home equity loans totaling $301 thousand which were modified as part of a troubled debt restructure or renewed with cash flow difficulties. The $1.1 million relationship was classified as substandard and remains in accrual status.\nThe increase in the nonperforming, substandard, special mention, and impaired loans reflected in the tables above for the twelve months ending December 31, 2018, are the result of the completion of the acquisition of First Personal as well as two commercial relationships, one commercial real estate customer and one First Federal residential customer which were all not related to the acquisition. First Personal loans totaling $612 thousand, one $523 thousand First Federal residential loan and one $464 thousand commercial real estate loan contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in nonperforming loans. One $1.1 million commercial relationship, First Personal loans totaling $721 thousand, one $523 thousand First Federal residential loan and one $464 thousand commercial real estate loan contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in substandard loans. First Personal loans totaling $2.8 million and one $2.1 million commercial relationship contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in watch loans, which was offset by the payoff of one $2.3 million commercial real estate loan. First Personal purchased credit impaired loans totaling $2.3 million, one $1.1 million commercial relationship and one $464 thousand commercial real estate loan contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in impaired loans.\nAt December 31, 2018, management is of the opinion that there are no loans, except certain of those discussed above, where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which will imminently result in such loans being classified as past due, non-accrual or a troubled debt restructure. Management does not presently anticipate that any of the non-performing loans or classified loans would materially affect future operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nThe allowance for loan losses (ALL) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses, increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs net of recoveries. A loan is charged off against the allowance by management as a loss when deemed uncollectible, although collection efforts continue and future recoveries may occur. The determination of the amounts of the ALL and provisions for loan losses is based on management's current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio with consideration given to all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability as of the reporting date. The appropriateness of the current period provision and the overall adequacy of the ALL are determined through a disciplined and consistently applied quarterly process that reviews the Bancorp's current credit risk within the loan portfolio and identifies the required allowance for loan losses given the current risk estimates.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>Page 38 of 91 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bancorp's provision for loan losses for the twelve months ended are summarized below:\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>413 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(73 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multifamily </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(150 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>749 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bancorp's charge-off and recovery information is summarized below:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>Charge-off </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Recoveries </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Charge-offs </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(194 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(193 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(119 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(95 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multifamily </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(592 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(458 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(58 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,011 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(828 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ALL provisions take into consideration management's current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio, loan portfolio balances, changes in the portfolio mix and local economic conditions. In determining the provision for loan losses for the current period, management has considered risks associated with the local economy, changes in loan balances and mix, and asset quality.\nThe Bancorp's allowance to total loans and non-performing loans are summarized below:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Allowance for loan losses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,482 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>764,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>620,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-performing loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,223 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ALL-to-total loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ALL-to-non-performing loans (coverage ratio) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe December 31, 2018 balance in the ALL account is considered adequate by management after evaluation of the loan portfolio, past experience and current economic and market conditions. While management may periodically allocate portions of the allowance for specific problem loans, the whole allowance is available for any loan charge offs that occur. The allocation of the ALL reflects performance and growth trends within the various loan categories, as well as consideration of the facts and circumstances that affect the repayment of individual loans, and loans which have been pooled as of the evaluation date, with particular attention given to non-performing loans and loans which have been classified as substandard, doubtful or loss. Management has allocated reserves to both performing and non-performing loans based on current information available.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>Page 39 of 91 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2018, foreclosed real estate totaled $1.6 million, which was comprised of twenty-four properties, compared to $1.7 million and sixteen properties at December 31, 2017. During 2018, loans totaling $282 thousand were transferred into foreclosed real estate, approximately $1.3 million of foreclosed real estate resulted from the First Personal acquisition, while net sales of foreclosed real estate totaled $1.6 million. Net gains from the 2018 sales totaled $54 thousand. Market value adjustments in 2018 of $135 thousand were also made. At the end of December 2018 all of the Bancorp's foreclosed real estate is located within its primary market area.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Bancorp's investment portfolio totaled $241.8 million and was invested as follows: 56.0% in U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, 38.9% in municipal securities, 3.3% in U.S. government agency debt securities, 0.8% in trust preferred securities, and 1% in a money market fund. During 2018, securities decreased by $2.7 million (1.1%). The decrease in the securities portfolio during the year is a result of market value adjustments for unrealized losses and the reallocation of funds to support loan growth. In addition, at December 31, 2018, the Bancorp had $3.5 million in FHLB stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Bancorp's three investments in trust preferred securities are in payment in kind\u201d status. Payment in kind status results in a temporary delay in the payment of interest. As a result of a delay in the collection of the interest payments, management placed these securities on non-accrual status. At December 31, 2018, the cost basis of the three trust preferred securities on non-accrual status totaled $3.5 million.\nDeposits are a fundamental and cost-effective source of funds for lending and other investment purposes. The Bancorp offers a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers, with the primary focus on building and expanding relationships. At December 31, 2018, deposits totaled $929.8 million. During 2018, deposits increased by $136.8 million (17.2%). The 2018 change in deposits was comprised of the following: certificates of deposit increased by $75.0 million (40.8%), checking accounts increased by $32.6 million (10.6%), savings accounts increased by $30.8 million (23.7%), and money market deposit accounts (MMDA's) decreased by $1.6 million (1.0%). Deposit balances increased for the year as a result of the First Personal acquisition. When adjusted for the First Personal acquisition, overall deposits decreased.\nThe Bancorp's borrowed funds are primarily comprised of repurchase agreements and FHLB advances that are used to fund asset growth not supported by deposit generation. At December 31, 2018, borrowed funds totaled $43.0 million compared to $20.8 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $22.1 million (105.9%). Borrowed funds increased as FHLB advances were utilized for funding loan originations. Retail repurchase agreements totaled $11.6 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $11.3 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $328 thousand (2.9%). FHLB advances totaled $43.0 million, increasing $25.9 million or 151.5%. The Bancorp did not carry a balance on the FHLB line of credit at December 31, 2018, compared to a $3.2 million balance at December 31, 2017. The Bancorp did not have any other borrowings at December 31, 2018, compared to $600 thousand at December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the Bancorp, liquidity management refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash to fund current loan demand, meet deposit withdrawals, and pay dividends and operating expenses. Because profit and liquidity are often conflicting objectives, management attempts to maximize the Bank's net interest margin by making adequate, but not excessive, liquidity provisions. Furthermore, funds are managed so that future profits will not be significantly impacted as funding costs increase.\nChanges in the liquidity position result from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities are generally the cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the determination of net income. The primary investing activities include loan originations, loan repayments, investments in interest bearing balances in financial institutions, and the purchase, sale, and maturity of investment securities. Financing activities focus almost entirely on the generation of customer deposits. In addition, the Bancorp utilizes borrowings (i.e., repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and federal funds purchased) as a source of funds.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>Page 40 of 91 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018, cash and cash equivalents increased $6.1 million compared to a decrease of $33.2 million for 2017. During 2018, the primary sources of cash and cash equivalents were from the acquisition of First Personal, maturities and sales of securities, loan sales and repayments, FHLB advances, and cash from operating activities. The primary uses of cash and cash equivalents were for the purchase of First Personal, loan originations, purchases of securities, FHLB advance repayments, and the payment of common stock dividends. During 2018, cash from operating activities totaled $6.4 million, compared to $12.3 million for 2017. The decrease in cash in-flow from operating activities was primarily a result of accrued expenses and other liabilities related to the First Personal acquisition. Cash outflows from investing activities totaled $31.2 million during 2018, compared to outflows of $47.8 million during 2017. The changes for the current year were related to decreased purchases of securities and in-take of cash and cash equivalents from acquisition activity. Net cash inflows from financing activities totaled $30.9 million in 2018, compared to net cash inflows of $2.3 million in 2017. The increase during 2018 was primarily due to the increase in deposits and borrowed funds. On a cash basis, the Bancorp paid dividends on common stock of $3.4 million and $3.3 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. During 2018, the Bancorp's Board of Directors increased dividends as earnings and capital continued to be sufficient to warrant dividend increases.\nManagement strongly believes that safety and soundness is enhanced by maintaining a high level of capital. Stockholders' equity totaled $101.5 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $92.1 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $9.4 million (10.2%). The increase was primarily the result of net income of $9.3 million and issuance of $6.9 million shares related to the acquisition of First Personal less $3.5 million in cash dividends and net unrealized loss of available for sale securities of $3.5 million. At December 31, 2018, book value per share was $33.50 compared to $32.14 for 2017.\nThe Bancorp is subject to risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the FRB, and the Bank is subject to risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the FDIC. As applied to the Bancorp and the Bank, the FRB and FDIC capital requirements are substantially the same. These regulations divide capital into various tiers, as described in Recent Developments - Regulatory Capital Rules\u201d above. The following table shows that, at December 31, 2018, the Bancorp's capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The dollar amounts are in millions.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Minimum Required To Be </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Minimum Required For </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Well Capitalized Under Prompt </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Capital Adequacy Purposes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Corrective Action Regulations </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>At December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratio </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total capital to risk-weighted assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows that, at December 31, 2018, the Bank's capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.

Under Indiana law, the Bank may pay dividends from its undivided profits (generally, earnings less losses, bad debts, taxes and other operating expenses) as is considered expedient by the Bank's Board of Directors. However, the Bank must obtain the approval of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would exceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, retained net income,\u201d means net income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. An exemption from DFI approval would require that the Bank have been assigned a composite uniform financial institutions rating of 1 or 2 as a result of the most recent federal or state examination; the proposed dividend would not result in a Tier 1 leverage ratio below 7.5%; and that the Bank not be subject to any corrective action, supervisory order, supervisory agreement, or board approved operating agreement. The aggregate amount of dividends that may be declared by the Bank in 2019, without the need for qualifying for an exemption or prior DFI approval, is $1.5 million plus 2019 net profits. Moreover, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the payment of dividends if it determines that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank. On December, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Bancorp declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.30 per share. The Bancorp's fourth quarter dividend was paid to shareholders on January 8, 2019.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>Page 41 of 91 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations -\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\nNet income for 2018 was $9.3 million, compared to $9.0 million for 2017, an increase of $376 thousand (4.2%). The twelve-month earnings increase is related to strong loan originations as well as the effects of the merger with First Personal and the tax effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that, among other changes, reduces the corporate federal income tax rate from 34% to 21% and was effective January 1, 2018. The earnings represent a return on average assets of 0.93% for 2018 compared to 0.98% for 2017. The return on average equity was 9.88% for 2018 compared to 9.90% for 2017.\nNet interest income for 2018 was $34.4 million, an increase of $3.6 million (11.7%) from $30.8 million for 2017. During the year, the Bancorp's yield on interest earning assets was positively impacted by higher yields, while interest expense was driven higher primarily by deposit account growth and an increased cost of funds. The weighted-average yield on interest-earning assets was 4.22% for 2018 compared to 3.91% for 2017. The weighted-average cost of funds was 0.57% for 2018 compared to 0.32% for 2017. The impact of the 4.22% return on interest earning assets and the 0.57% cost of funds resulted in a net interest spread of 3.65% for 2018, compared to a net interest spread of 3.59% for 2017. During 2018, total interest income increased by $6.1 million (18.3%) while total interest expense increased by $2.5 million (96.4%). The net interest margin was 3.67% for 2018, compared to 3.61% for 2017. The Bancorp's tax equivalent net interest margin for 2018 was 3.81% compared to 3.84% for 2017.\nDuring 2018, interest income from loans increased by $5.5 million (20.6%) compared to 2017. The increase in interest income from loans is a result of strong loan originations as well as the effects of the merger with First Personal. The weighted-average yield on loans outstanding was 4.71% for 2018 compared to 4.45% for 2017. Loan balances averaged $687.2 million for 2018, an increase of $83.3 million (13.8%) from $603.9 million for 2017. During 2018, interest income from securities and other interest earning assets increased by $559 thousand (8.6%) compared to 2017. The weighted-average yield on securities and other interest earning assets was 2.84% for 2018 compared to 2.61% for 2017. Securities and other interest earning assets averaged $248.4 million for 2018, down $173 thousand (0.1%) from $248.6 million for 2017.\nInterest expense for deposits increased by $1.7 million (84.5%) during 2018 compared to 2017. The change was due to an increase in the weighted-average rate paid on deposits and increased balances from the acquisition of First Personal as well as internal sales efforts. The weighted-average rate paid on deposits for 2018 was 0.45% compared to 0.27% for 2017. Total deposit balances averaged $839.5 million for 2018, an increase of $69.3 million (9.0%) from $770.2 million for 2017. Interest expense for borrowed funds increased by $696 thousand (165.7%) during 2018 compared to 2017. The change was due to strong loan originations, some of which were funded with borrowed funds. The weighted-average cost of borrowed funds was 2.25% for 2018 compared to 1.27% for 2017. Borrowed funds averaged $57.4 million during 2018, an increase of $15.3 million (35.4%) from $42.1 million for 2017.\nNoninterest income for 2018 was $9.1 million, an increase of $1.3 million (17.4%) from $7.8 million for 2017. During 2018, fees and service charges totaled $3.9 million, an increase of $555 thousand (16.8%) from $3.3 million for 2017. The increase in fees and service charges is the result of the Bancorp's growing depository base and enhanced product offerings. Fees from Wealth Management operations totaled $1.70 million for 2018, a decrease of $15 thousand (0.8%) from $1.70 million for 2017. Gains from loan sales totaled $1.6 million for the current year, an increase of $419 thousand (34.9%), compared to $1.2 million for 2017. The increase in gains from the sale of loans is a result of increased originations for the year. Gains from the sale of securities totaled $1.2 million for the current year, an increase of $340 thousand (39.5%) from $860 thousand for 2017. Current market conditions continue to provide opportunities to manage securities cash flows, while recognizing gains from the sales of securities. In 2018, $494 thousand from the increase in the cash value of bank owned life insurance was recorded, an increase of $34 thousand (7.4%) compared to $460 thousand for 2017. The increase in the cash value of bank owned life insurance is a result of the acquisition of First Personal. For 2018, foreclosed real estate sales gains totaled $54 thousand, an decrease of $49 thousand (47.6%) from $103 thousand for 2017. During 2018, other noninterest income totaled $170 thousand, an increase of $63 thousand (58.9%) from $107 thousand for 2017. Rental income from REO properties was the main reason for the increase in other noninterest income for 2018.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>Page 42 of 91 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense for 2018 was $31.4 million, up $5.9 million (23.1%) from $25.5 million for 2017. During 2018, compensation and benefits totaled $16.4 million, an increase of $2.2 million (15.4%) from $14.2 million for 2017. The increase in compensation and benefits is the result of the Bancorp's ordinary course, annual adjustments to salaries, as well as increases due to the acquisition of First Personal. Occupancy and equipment expense totaled $3.7 million for 2018, an increase of $372 thousand (11.3%) compared to $3.3 million for 2017. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense is the result of higher building operating expenses, as well as increases due to the acquisition of First Personal. Data processing expense totaled $2.5 million for 2018, an increase of $1.0 million (69.8%) from $1.5 million for 2017. Data processing expense has increased as a result of increased system utilization, as well as increases due to the acquisition of First Personal. Marketing expense related to banking products totaled $707 thousand for the year, an increase of $112 thousand (18.8%) from $595 thousand for 2017. The increase in marketing expense is primarily related to the acquisition of First Personal. Federal deposit insurance premiums totaled $410 thousand for 2018, an increase of $74 thousand (22.0%) from $336 thousand for 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of First Personal that resulted in a higher assessment base. Statement and check processing expense totaled $414 thousand for the year, an increase of $31 thousand (8.1%) from $383 thousand for 2017. Professional service expense totaled $713 thousand for the year, an increase of $270 thousand (60.9%) from $443 thousand for 2017. The increase in professional services was directly related to cost associated with the acquisition of First Personal. Other expenses related to banking operations totaled $6.6 million for 2018, an increase of $1.8 million (38.3%) from $4.8 million for 2017. The increase in other operating expenses is primarily related to the acquisition of First Personal and accounts for approximately $609 thousand of one-time expenses and approximately $301 thousand of ongoing expenses that make up the increase for the year ended December 31, 2018. The remainder of the increase in other noninterest expense is primarily related to a shared loss of $125 thousand from the operation of the wholly-owned subsidiary NWIN Risk Management, Inc. (a captive insurance subsidiary), as well as generally higher third party costs. The Bancorp's efficiency ratio for 2018 was 72.21% compared to 66.17% for 2017. The weaker efficiency ratio is primarily the result of one-time costs associated with the acquisition of First Personal. The ratio is determined by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and total noninterest income for the period.\nThe Bancorp had an income tax expense for 2018 of $1.4 million compared to income tax expense of $2.9 million for 2017, a decrease to expense of $1.4 million (50.2%). The combined effective federal and state tax rates for the Bancorp were 13.3% for 2018 and 24.3% for 2017. The Bancorp's lower current period effective tax rate is a result of the revaluation of the Bancorp's net deferred tax asset during December 2017, that resulted in a one-time write down of $517 thousand that was recorded as additional income tax expense. Current period tax expense was also positively impacted by the TCJA that, among other changes, reduces the top corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to a flat rate of 21% and was effective January 1, 2018. A valuation allowance remains for certain other state tax credits that management does not believe will be fully utilized before statutory expiration.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the Bancorp's financial condition and that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The Bancorp's most critical accounting policies are summarized below. Other accounting policies, including those related to the fair values of financial instruments and the status of contingencies, are summarized in Note 1 to the Bancorp's consolidated financial statements.\nValuation of Investment Securities - The fair values of securities available for sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or pricing models utilizing significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different estimates of value. In certain cases where market data is not readily available because of lack of market activity or little public disclosure, values may be based on unobservable inputs and classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>Page 43 of 91 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt the end of each reporting period securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with the Investments - Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. Significant judgments are required in determining impairment, which include making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments, loss assumptions and the change in interest rates.\nWe consider the following factors when determining an other-than-temporary impairment for a security: The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future; and an assessment of whether the Bancorp has (1) the intent to sell the debt securities or (2) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt securities before its anticipated market recovery. If either of these conditions is met, management will recognize other-than-temporary impairment. If, in management's judgment, an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written down for the credit loss, and the unrealized loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings. Management will utilize an independent valuation specialist to value securities semi-annually for other-than-temporary impairment.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - The Bancorp maintains an Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) to absorb probable incurred credit losses that arise from the loan portfolio. The ALL is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs net of recoveries. The determination of the amounts of the ALL and provisions for loan losses is based upon management's current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio with consideration given to all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability. The methodology used to determine the current year provision and the overall adequacy of the ALL includes a disciplined and consistently applied quarterly process that combines a review of the current position with a risk assessment worksheet. Factors that are taken into consideration in the analysis include an assessment of national and local economic trends, a review of current year loan portfolio growth and changes in portfolio mix, and an assessment of trends for loan delinquencies and loan charge-off activity. Particular attention is given to non-accruing loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more, and loans that have been classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss. Changes in the provision are directionally consistent with changes in observable data.\nCommercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans that exhibit credit weaknesses and loans that have been classified as impaired are subject to an individual review. Where appropriate, ALL allocations are made to these loans based on management's assessment of financial position, current cash flows, collateral values, financial strength of guarantors, industry trends, and economic conditions. ALL allocations for homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, are based on historical charge-off activity and current delinquency trends. Management has allocated general reserves to both performing and non-performing loans based on historical data and current information available.\nRisk factors for non-performing and internally classified loans are based on an analysis of either the projected discounted cash flows or the estimated collateral liquidation value for individual loans defined as substandard or doubtful. Estimated collateral liquidation values are based on established loan underwriting standards and adjusted for current mitigating factors on a loan-by-loan basis. Aggregate substandard loan collateral deficiencies are determined for residential, commercial real estate, commercial business, and consumer loan portfolios. These deficiencies are then stated as a percentage of the total substandard balances to determine the appropriate risk factors.\nRisk factors for performing and non-classified loans are based on a weighted average of net charge-offs for the most recent three years, which are then stated as a percentage of average loans for the same period. Historical risk factors are calculated for residential, commercial real estate, commercial business, and consumer loans. The three year weighted average historical factors are then adjusted for current subjective risks attributable to: regional and national economic factors; loan growth and changes in loan composition; organizational structure; composition of loan staff; loan concentrations; policy changes and out of market lending activity.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>Page 44 of 91 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe risk factors are applied to these types of loans to determine the appropriate level for the ALL. Adjustments may be made to these allocations that reflect management's judgment on current conditions, delinquency trends, and charge-off activity. Based on the above discussion, management believes that the ALL is currently adequate, but not excessive, given the risk inherent in the loan portfolio.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary assets and liabilities of the Bancorp are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Bancorp's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or magnitude as the prices of goods and services.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Bancorp's earnings are dependent upon the earnings of the Bank. The Bank's earnings are primarily dependent upon net interest margin. The net interest margin is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings stated as a percentage of average interest earning assets. The net interest margin is perhaps the clearest indicator of a financial institution's ability to generate core earnings. Fees and service charges, wealth management operations income, gains and losses from the sale of assets, provisions for loan losses, income taxes and operating expenses also affect the Bancorp's profitability.\nA summary of the Bancorp's significant accounting policies are detailed in Note 1 to the Bancorp's consolidated financial statements included in this report. Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the disclosures provided. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates associated with the allowance for loan losses, fair values of foreclosed real estate, loan servicing rights, investment securities, deferred tax assets, goodwill, and the status of contingencies are particularly susceptible to material change in the near term.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Bancorp had total assets of $1.1 billion and total deposits of $929.8 million. The Bancorp's deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) that is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an agency of the federal government. At December 31, 2018, stockholders' equity totaled $101.5 million, with book value per share at $33.50. Net income for 2018 was $9.3 million, or $3.17 basic and diluted earnings per common share. The return on average assets was 0.93%, while the return on average stockholders' equity was 9.88%.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of First Personal Financial Corp. On July 26, 2018, the Bancorp completed its previously announced acquisition of First Personal Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation ( First Personal\u201d) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 20, 2018 (the First Personal Merger Agreement\u201d) between the Bancorp and First Personal. Pursuant to the terms of the First Personal Merger Agreement, First Personal merged with and into the Bancorp, with the Bancorp as the surviving corporation (the First Personal Merger\u201d). Simultaneous with the First Personal Merger, First Personal Bank, an Illinois state chartered commercial bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of First Personal, merged with and into Peoples Bank SB, with Peoples Bank as the surviving institution. The acquisition represented the Bank's first expansion into the South Suburban Chicagoland market, and expanded the Bank's full-service retail banking network to 19 banking centers.\nIn connection with the First Personal Merger, each First Personal stockholder holding 100 or more shares of First Personal common stock received fixed consideration of (i) 0.1246 shares of Bancorp common stock, and (ii) $6.67 per share in cash for each outstanding share of First Personal common stock. Stockholders holding less than 100 shares of First Personal common stock received $12.12 in cash and no stock consideration for each outstanding share of First Personal common stock. Any fractional shares of Bancorp common stock that a First Personal stockholder would have otherwise received in the First Personal Merger were cashed out in the amount of such fraction multiplied by $42.95.\nThe Bancorp issued a total of 161,875 shares of Bancorp common stock to the former First Personal stockholders, and paid cash consideration of approximately $8.7 million. Based upon the closing price of Bancorp's common stock on July 25, 2018, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately $15.6 million.\nAcquisition of AJS Bancorp, Inc. On January 24, 2019, the Bancorp completed its acquisition of AJS Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation ( AJSB\u201d), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 30, 2018 (the AJSB Merger Agreement\u201d) between the Bancorp and AJSB. Pursuant to the terms of the AJSB Merger Agreement, AJSB merged with and into the Bancorp, with the Bancorp as the surviving corporation (the AJSB Merger\u201d). Simultaneous with the AJSB Merger, A.J. Smith Federal Savings Bank, a federally chartered savings bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of AJSB, merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving institution.\n Page 34 of 91 \nIn connection with the AJSB Merger, each AJSB stockholder holding 100 or more shares of AJSB common stock received fixed consideration of (i) 0.2030 shares of the Bancorp common stock, and (ii) $7.20 per share in cash for each outstanding share of AJSB common stock. Stockholders holding less than 100 shares of AJSB common stock received $16.00 in cash and no stock consideration for each outstanding share of AJSB common stock. Any fractional shares of Bancorp common stock that an AJSB stockholder would have otherwise received in the AJSB Merger were cashed out in the amount of such fraction multiplied by $43.01.\nThe Bancorp issued 416,478 shares of Bancorp common stock to the former AJSB stockholders, and paid cash consideration of approximately $15.4 million. Based upon the closing price of the Bancorp's common stock on January 23, 2019, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately $34.2 million, which includes unallocated shares held by the AJSB Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP\u201d), some of which were cancelled in connection with the closing to satisfy the ESOP's outstanding loan balance. As a result of the acquisition, the Bank was able to further expand its retail banking network in the South Suburban Chicagoland market, bringing the total number of its full-service banking centers to 22.\nFinancial Condition\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, total assets increased by $168.9 million (18.2%), to $1.1 billion, with interest-earning assets increasing by $146.9 million (16.9%). At December 31, 2018, interest-earning assets totaled $1.0 billion and represented 92.9% of total assets. Loans totaled $764.4 million and represented 75.1% of interest-earning assets, 69.7% of total assets and 82.2% of total deposits. The loan portfolio, which is the Bancorp's largest asset, is a significant source of both interest and fee income.\n\nThe Bancorp is primarily a portfolio lender. Mortgage banking activities historically have been limited to the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans with contractual maturities greater than 15 years. These loans are identified as held for sale when originated and sold, on a loan-by-loan basis, in the secondary market. The Bancorp will also retain fixed rate mortgage loans with a contractual maturity greater than 15 years on a limited basis. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Bancorp originated $55.5 million in new fixed rate mortgage loans for sale, compared to $42.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Net gains realized from the mortgage loan sales totaled $1.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the Bancorp had $2.9 million in loans that were classified as held for sale, compared to $1.6 million at December 31, 2017.\n Page 35 of 91 \nNon-performing loans include those loans that are 90 days or more past due and accruing and those loans that have been placed on non-accrual status. At December 31, 2018, all non-performing loans are also accounted for on a non-accrual basis, except for three commercial business loans totaling $149 thousand, one residential loan totaling $122 thousand and one home equity loan totaling $50 thousand that remained accruing and more than 90 days past due.\nThe Bancorp's nonperforming loans are summarized below:\n\nSubstandard loans include non-performing loans and potential problem loans, where information about possible credit issues or other conditions causes management to question the ability of such borrowers to comply with loan covenants or repayment terms. No loans were internally classified as doubtful or loss at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017.\nThe Bancorp's substandard loans are summarized below:\n\nIn addition to identifying and monitoring non-performing and other classified loans, management maintains a list of special mention loans. Special mention loans represent loans management is closely monitoring due to one or more factors that may cause the loan to become classified as substandard.\n Page 36 of 91 \nThe Bancorp's special mention loans are summarized below:\n\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Typically, management does not individually classify smaller-balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgages or consumer loans, as impaired, unless they are troubled debt restructurings.\nPurchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date. Purchased loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination are considered purchased credit impaired loans. Expected future cash flows at the purchase date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable ( accretable yield\u201d). The difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference and represents probable losses in the portfolio. In determining the acquisition date fair value of purchased credit impaired loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Bancorp aggregates these purchased loans into pools of loans by common risk characteristics, such as credit risk rating and loan type. Subsequent to the purchase date, increases in cash flows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses.\nThe Bancorp's impaired loans, including purchased credit impaired loans, are summarized below:\n\nAt times, the Bancorp will modify the terms of a loan to forego a portion of interest or principal or reduce the interest rate on the loan to a rate materially less than market rates, or materially extend the maturity date of a loan as part of a troubled debt restructuring. The valuation basis for the Bancorp's troubled debt restructurings is based on the present value of expected future cash flows; unless consistent cash flows are not present, then the fair value of the collateral securing the loan is the basis for valuation.\n Page 37 of 91 \nThe Bancorp's troubled debt restructured loans are summarized below:\n\nThe increase in the troubled debt restructure loans reflected in the table above for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was the result of a $1.1 million commercial relationship as well as eight residential or home equity loans totaling $301 thousand which were modified as part of a troubled debt restructure or renewed with cash flow difficulties. The $1.1 million relationship was classified as substandard and remains in accrual status.\nThe increase in the nonperforming, substandard, special mention, and impaired loans reflected in the tables above for the twelve months ending December 31, 2018, are the result of the completion of the acquisition of First Personal as well as two commercial relationships, one commercial real estate customer and one First Federal residential customer which were all not related to the acquisition. First Personal loans totaling $612 thousand, one $523 thousand First Federal residential loan and one $464 thousand commercial real estate loan contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in nonperforming loans. One $1.1 million commercial relationship, First Personal loans totaling $721 thousand, one $523 thousand First Federal residential loan and one $464 thousand commercial real estate loan contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in substandard loans. First Personal loans totaling $2.8 million and one $2.1 million commercial relationship contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in watch loans, which was offset by the payoff of one $2.3 million commercial real estate loan. First Personal purchased credit impaired loans totaling $2.3 million, one $1.1 million commercial relationship and one $464 thousand commercial real estate loan contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in impaired loans.\nAt December 31, 2018, management is of the opinion that there are no loans, except certain of those discussed above, where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which will imminently result in such loans being classified as past due, non-accrual or a troubled debt restructure. Management does not presently anticipate that any of the non-performing loans or classified loans would materially affect future operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nThe allowance for loan losses (ALL) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses, increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs net of recoveries. A loan is charged off against the allowance by management as a loss when deemed uncollectible, although collection efforts continue and future recoveries may occur. The determination of the amounts of the ALL and provisions for loan losses is based on management's current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio with consideration given to all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability as of the reporting date. The appropriateness of the current period provision and the overall adequacy of the ALL are determined through a disciplined and consistently applied quarterly process that reviews the Bancorp's current credit risk within the loan portfolio and identifies the required allowance for loan losses given the current risk estimates.\n Page 38 of 91 \nThe Bancorp's provision for loan losses for the twelve months ended are summarized below:\n\nThe Bancorp's charge-off and recovery information is summarized below:\n\nThe ALL provisions take into consideration management's current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio, loan portfolio balances, changes in the portfolio mix and local economic conditions. In determining the provision for loan losses for the current period, management has considered risks associated with the local economy, changes in loan balances and mix, and asset quality.\nThe Bancorp's allowance to total loans and non-performing loans are summarized below:\n\nThe December 31, 2018 balance in the ALL account is considered adequate by management after evaluation of the loan portfolio, past experience and current economic and market conditions. While management may periodically allocate portions of the allowance for specific problem loans, the whole allowance is available for any loan charge offs that occur. The allocation of the ALL reflects performance and growth trends within the various loan categories, as well as consideration of the facts and circumstances that affect the repayment of individual loans, and loans which have been pooled as of the evaluation date, with particular attention given to non-performing loans and loans which have been classified as substandard, doubtful or loss. Management has allocated reserves to both performing and non-performing loans based on current information available.\n Page 39 of 91 \nAt December 31, 2018, foreclosed real estate totaled $1.6 million, which was comprised of twenty-four properties, compared to $1.7 million and sixteen properties at December 31, 2017. During 2018, loans totaling $282 thousand were transferred into foreclosed real estate, approximately $1.3 million of foreclosed real estate resulted from the First Personal acquisition, while net sales of foreclosed real estate totaled $1.6 million. Net gains from the 2018 sales totaled $54 thousand. Market value adjustments in 2018 of $135 thousand were also made. At the end of December 2018 all of the Bancorp's foreclosed real estate is located within its primary market area.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Bancorp's investment portfolio totaled $241.8 million and was invested as follows: 56.0% in U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, 38.9% in municipal securities, 3.3% in U.S. government agency debt securities, 0.8% in trust preferred securities, and 1% in a money market fund. During 2018, securities decreased by $2.7 million (1.1%). The decrease in the securities portfolio during the year is a result of market value adjustments for unrealized losses and the reallocation of funds to support loan growth. In addition, at December 31, 2018, the Bancorp had $3.5 million in FHLB stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Bancorp's three investments in trust preferred securities are in payment in kind\u201d status. Payment in kind status results in a temporary delay in the payment of interest. As a result of a delay in the collection of the interest payments, management placed these securities on non-accrual status. At December 31, 2018, the cost basis of the three trust preferred securities on non-accrual status totaled $3.5 million.\nDeposits are a fundamental and cost-effective source of funds for lending and other investment purposes. The Bancorp offers a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers, with the primary focus on building and expanding relationships. At December 31, 2018, deposits totaled $929.8 million. During 2018, deposits increased by $136.8 million (17.2%). The 2018 change in deposits was comprised of the following: certificates of deposit increased by $75.0 million (40.8%), checking accounts increased by $32.6 million (10.6%), savings accounts increased by $30.8 million (23.7%), and money market deposit accounts (MMDA's) decreased by $1.6 million (1.0%). Deposit balances increased for the year as a result of the First Personal acquisition. When adjusted for the First Personal acquisition, overall deposits decreased.\nThe Bancorp's borrowed funds are primarily comprised of repurchase agreements and FHLB advances that are used to fund asset growth not supported by deposit generation. At December 31, 2018, borrowed funds totaled $43.0 million compared to $20.8 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $22.1 million (105.9%). Borrowed funds increased as FHLB advances were utilized for funding loan originations. Retail repurchase agreements totaled $11.6 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $11.3 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $328 thousand (2.9%). FHLB advances totaled $43.0 million, increasing $25.9 million or 151.5%. The Bancorp did not carry a balance on the FHLB line of credit at December 31, 2018, compared to a $3.2 million balance at December 31, 2017. The Bancorp did not have any other borrowings at December 31, 2018, compared to $600 thousand at December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the Bancorp, liquidity management refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash to fund current loan demand, meet deposit withdrawals, and pay dividends and operating expenses. Because profit and liquidity are often conflicting objectives, management attempts to maximize the Bank's net interest margin by making adequate, but not excessive, liquidity provisions. Furthermore, funds are managed so that future profits will not be significantly impacted as funding costs increase.\nChanges in the liquidity position result from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities are generally the cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the determination of net income. The primary investing activities include loan originations, loan repayments, investments in interest bearing balances in financial institutions, and the purchase, sale, and maturity of investment securities. Financing activities focus almost entirely on the generation of customer deposits. In addition, the Bancorp utilizes borrowings (i.e., repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and federal funds purchased) as a source of funds.\n Page 40 of 91 \nDuring 2018, cash and cash equivalents increased $6.1 million compared to a decrease of $33.2 million for 2017. During 2018, the primary sources of cash and cash equivalents were from the acquisition of First Personal, maturities and sales of securities, loan sales and repayments, FHLB advances, and cash from operating activities. The primary uses of cash and cash equivalents were for the purchase of First Personal, loan originations, purchases of securities, FHLB advance repayments, and the payment of common stock dividends. During 2018, cash from operating activities totaled $6.4 million, compared to $12.3 million for 2017. The decrease in cash in-flow from operating activities was primarily a result of accrued expenses and other liabilities related to the First Personal acquisition. Cash outflows from investing activities totaled $31.2 million during 2018, compared to outflows of $47.8 million during 2017. The changes for the current year were related to decreased purchases of securities and in-take of cash and cash equivalents from acquisition activity. Net cash inflows from financing activities totaled $30.9 million in 2018, compared to net cash inflows of $2.3 million in 2017. The increase during 2018 was primarily due to the increase in deposits and borrowed funds. On a cash basis, the Bancorp paid dividends on common stock of $3.4 million and $3.3 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. During 2018, the Bancorp's Board of Directors increased dividends as earnings and capital continued to be sufficient to warrant dividend increases.\nManagement strongly believes that safety and soundness is enhanced by maintaining a high level of capital. Stockholders' equity totaled $101.5 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $92.1 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $9.4 million (10.2%). The increase was primarily the result of net income of $9.3 million and issuance of $6.9 million shares related to the acquisition of First Personal less $3.5 million in cash dividends and net unrealized loss of available for sale securities of $3.5 million. At December 31, 2018, book value per share was $33.50 compared to $32.14 for 2017.\nThe Bancorp is subject to risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the FRB, and the Bank is subject to risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the FDIC. As applied to the Bancorp and the Bank, the FRB and FDIC capital requirements are substantially the same. These regulations divide capital into various tiers, as described in Recent Developments - Regulatory Capital Rules\u201d above. The following table shows that, at December 31, 2018, the Bancorp's capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The dollar amounts are in millions.\n\nThe following table shows that, at December 31, 2018, the Bank's capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The dollar amounts are in millions.\n\nThe Bancorp's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is entirely dependent upon the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Bancorp. Under Indiana law, the Bank may pay dividends from its undivided profits (generally, earnings less losses, bad debts, taxes and other operating expenses) as is considered expedient by the Bank's Board of Directors. However, the Bank must obtain the approval of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would exceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, retained net income,\u201d means net income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. An exemption from DFI approval would require that the Bank have been assigned a composite uniform financial institutions rating of 1 or 2 as a result of the most recent federal or state examination; the proposed dividend would not result in a Tier 1 leverage ratio below 7.5%; and that the Bank not be subject to any corrective action, supervisory order, supervisory agreement, or board approved operating agreement. The aggregate amount of dividends that may be declared by the Bank in 2019, without the need for qualifying for an exemption or prior DFI approval, is $1.5 million plus 2019 net profits. Moreover, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the payment of dividends if it determines that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank. On December, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Bancorp declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.30 per share. The Bancorp's fourth quarter dividend was paid to shareholders on January 8, 2019.\n Page 41 of 91 \nResults of Operations -\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\nNet income for 2018 was $9.3 million, compared to $9.0 million for 2017, an increase of $376 thousand (4.2%). The twelve-month earnings increase is related to strong loan originations as well as the effects of the merger with First Personal and the tax effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that, among other changes, reduces the corporate federal income tax rate from 34% to 21% and was effective January 1, 2018. The earnings represent a return on average assets of 0.93% for 2018 compared to 0.98% for 2017. The return on average equity was 9.88% for 2018 compared to 9.90% for 2017.\nNet interest income for 2018 was $34.4 million, an increase of $3.6 million (11.7%) from $30.8 million for 2017. During the year, the Bancorp's yield on interest earning assets was positively impacted by higher yields, while interest expense was driven higher primarily by deposit account growth and an increased cost of funds. The weighted-average yield on interest-earning assets was 4.22% for 2018 compared to 3.91% for 2017. The weighted-average cost of funds was 0.57% for 2018 compared to 0.32% for 2017. The impact of the 4.22% return on interest earning assets and the 0.57% cost of funds resulted in a net interest spread of 3.65% for 2018, compared to a net interest spread of 3.59% for 2017. During 2018, total interest income increased by $6.1 million (18.3%) while total interest expense increased by $2.5 million (96.4%). The net interest margin was 3.67% for 2018, compared to 3.61% for 2017. The Bancorp's tax equivalent net interest margin for 2018 was 3.81% compared to 3.84% for 2017.\nDuring 2018, interest income from loans increased by $5.5 million (20.6%) compared to 2017. The increase in interest income from loans is a result of strong loan originations as well as the effects of the merger with First Personal. The weighted-average yield on loans outstanding was 4.71% for 2018 compared to 4.45% for 2017. Loan balances averaged $687.2 million for 2018, an increase of $83.3 million (13.8%) from $603.9 million for 2017. During 2018, interest income from securities and other interest earning assets increased by $559 thousand (8.6%) compared to 2017. The weighted-average yield on securities and other interest earning assets was 2.84% for 2018 compared to 2.61% for 2017. Securities and other interest earning assets averaged $248.4 million for 2018, down $173 thousand (0.1%) from $248.6 million for 2017.\nInterest expense for deposits increased by $1.7 million (84.5%) during 2018 compared to 2017. The change was due to an increase in the weighted-average rate paid on deposits and increased balances from the acquisition of First Personal as well as internal sales efforts. The weighted-average rate paid on deposits for 2018 was 0.45% compared to 0.27% for 2017. Total deposit balances averaged $839.5 million for 2018, an increase of $69.3 million (9.0%) from $770.2 million for 2017. Interest expense for borrowed funds increased by $696 thousand (165.7%) during 2018 compared to 2017. The change was due to strong loan originations, some of which were funded with borrowed funds. The weighted-average cost of borrowed funds was 2.25% for 2018 compared to 1.27% for 2017. Borrowed funds averaged $57.4 million during 2018, an increase of $15.3 million (35.4%) from $42.1 million for 2017.\nNoninterest income for 2018 was $9.1 million, an increase of $1.3 million (17.4%) from $7.8 million for 2017. During 2018, fees and service charges totaled $3.9 million, an increase of $555 thousand (16.8%) from $3.3 million for 2017. The increase in fees and service charges is the result of the Bancorp's growing depository base and enhanced product offerings. Fees from Wealth Management operations totaled $1.70 million for 2018, a decrease of $15 thousand (0.8%) from $1.70 million for 2017. Gains from loan sales totaled $1.6 million for the current year, an increase of $419 thousand (34.9%), compared to $1.2 million for 2017. The increase in gains from the sale of loans is a result of increased originations for the year. Gains from the sale of securities totaled $1.2 million for the current year, an increase of $340 thousand (39.5%) from $860 thousand for 2017. Current market conditions continue to provide opportunities to manage securities cash flows, while recognizing gains from the sales of securities. In 2018, $494 thousand from the increase in the cash value of bank owned life insurance was recorded, an increase of $34 thousand (7.4%) compared to $460 thousand for 2017. The increase in the cash value of bank owned life insurance is a result of the acquisition of First Personal. For 2018, foreclosed real estate sales gains totaled $54 thousand, an decrease of $49 thousand (47.6%) from $103 thousand for 2017. During 2018, other noninterest income totaled $170 thousand, an increase of $63 thousand (58.9%) from $107 thousand for 2017. Rental income from REO properties was the main reason for the increase in other noninterest income for 2018.\n Page 42 of 91 \nNoninterest expense for 2018 was $31.4 million, up $5.9 million (23.1%) from $25.5 million for 2017. During 2018, compensation and benefits totaled $16.4 million, an increase of $2.2 million (15.4%) from $14.2 million for 2017. The increase in compensation and benefits is the result of the Bancorp's ordinary course, annual adjustments to salaries, as well as increases due to the acquisition of First Personal. Occupancy and equipment expense totaled $3.7 million for 2018, an increase of $372 thousand (11.3%) compared to $3.3 million for 2017. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense is the result of higher building operating expenses, as well as increases due to the acquisition of First Personal. Data processing expense totaled $2.5 million for 2018, an increase of $1.0 million (69.8%) from $1.5 million for 2017. Data processing expense has increased as a result of increased system utilization, as well as increases due to the acquisition of First Personal. Marketing expense related to banking products totaled $707 thousand for the year, an increase of $112 thousand (18.8%) from $595 thousand for 2017. The increase in marketing expense is primarily related to the acquisition of First Personal. Federal deposit insurance premiums totaled $410 thousand for 2018, an increase of $74 thousand (22.0%) from $336 thousand for 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of First Personal that resulted in a higher assessment base. Statement and check processing expense totaled $414 thousand for the year, an increase of $31 thousand (8.1%) from $383 thousand for 2017. Professional service expense totaled $713 thousand for the year, an increase of $270 thousand (60.9%) from $443 thousand for 2017. The increase in professional services was directly related to cost associated with the acquisition of First Personal. Other expenses related to banking operations totaled $6.6 million for 2018, an increase of $1.8 million (38.3%) from $4.8 million for 2017. The increase in other operating expenses is primarily related to the acquisition of First Personal and accounts for approximately $609 thousand of one-time expenses and approximately $301 thousand of ongoing expenses that make up the increase for the year ended December 31, 2018. The remainder of the increase in other noninterest expense is primarily related to a shared loss of $125 thousand from the operation of the wholly-owned subsidiary NWIN Risk Management, Inc. (a captive insurance subsidiary), as well as generally higher third party costs. The Bancorp's efficiency ratio for 2018 was 72.21% compared to 66.17% for 2017. The weaker efficiency ratio is primarily the result of one-time costs associated with the acquisition of First Personal. The ratio is determined by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and total noninterest income for the period.\nThe Bancorp had an income tax expense for 2018 of $1.4 million compared to income tax expense of $2.9 million for 2017, a decrease to expense of $1.4 million (50.2%). The combined effective federal and state tax rates for the Bancorp were 13.3% for 2018 and 24.3% for 2017. The Bancorp's lower current period effective tax rate is a result of the revaluation of the Bancorp's net deferred tax asset during December 2017, that resulted in a one-time write down of $517 thousand that was recorded as additional income tax expense. Current period tax expense was also positively impacted by the TCJA that, among other changes, reduces the top corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to a flat rate of 21% and was effective January 1, 2018. A valuation allowance remains for certain other state tax credits that management does not believe will be fully utilized before statutory expiration.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the Bancorp's financial condition and that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The Bancorp's most critical accounting policies are summarized below. Other accounting policies, including those related to the fair values of financial instruments and the status of contingencies, are summarized in Note 1 to the Bancorp's consolidated financial statements.\nValuation of Investment Securities - The fair values of securities available for sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or pricing models utilizing significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different estimates of value. In certain cases where market data is not readily available because of lack of market activity or little public disclosure, values may be based on unobservable inputs and classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n Page 43 of 91 \nAt the end of each reporting period securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with the Investments - Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. Significant judgments are required in determining impairment, which include making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments, loss assumptions and the change in interest rates.\nWe consider the following factors when determining an other-than-temporary impairment for a security: The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future; and an assessment of whether the Bancorp has (1) the intent to sell the debt securities or (2) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt securities before its anticipated market recovery. If either of these conditions is met, management will recognize other-than-temporary impairment. If, in management's judgment, an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written down for the credit loss, and the unrealized loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings. Management will utilize an independent valuation specialist to value securities semi-annually for other-than-temporary impairment.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - The Bancorp maintains an Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) to absorb probable incurred credit losses that arise from the loan portfolio. The ALL is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs net of recoveries. The determination of the amounts of the ALL and provisions for loan losses is based upon management's current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio with consideration given to all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability. The methodology used to determine the current year provision and the overall adequacy of the ALL includes a disciplined and consistently applied quarterly process that combines a review of the current position with a risk assessment worksheet. Factors that are taken into consideration in the analysis include an assessment of national and local economic trends, a review of current year loan portfolio growth and changes in portfolio mix, and an assessment of trends for loan delinquencies and loan charge-off activity. Particular attention is given to non-accruing loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more, and loans that have been classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss. Changes in the provision are directionally consistent with changes in observable data.\nCommercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans that exhibit credit weaknesses and loans that have been classified as impaired are subject to an individual review. Where appropriate, ALL allocations are made to these loans based on management's assessment of financial position, current cash flows, collateral values, financial strength of guarantors, industry trends, and economic conditions. ALL allocations for homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, are based on historical charge-off activity and current delinquency trends. Management has allocated general reserves to both performing and non-performing loans based on historical data and current information available.\nRisk factors for non-performing and internally classified loans are based on an analysis of either the projected discounted cash flows or the estimated collateral liquidation value for individual loans defined as substandard or doubtful. Estimated collateral liquidation values are based on established loan underwriting standards and adjusted for current mitigating factors on a loan-by-loan basis. Aggregate substandard loan collateral deficiencies are determined for residential, commercial real estate, commercial business, and consumer loan portfolios. These deficiencies are then stated as a percentage of the total substandard balances to determine the appropriate risk factors.\nRisk factors for performing and non-classified loans are based on a weighted average of net charge-offs for the most recent three years, which are then stated as a percentage of average loans for the same period. Historical risk factors are calculated for residential, commercial real estate, commercial business, and consumer loans. The three year weighted average historical factors are then adjusted for current subjective risks attributable to: regional and national economic factors; loan growth and changes in loan composition; organizational structure; composition of loan staff; loan concentrations; policy changes and out of market lending activity.\n Page 44 of 91 \nThe risk factors are applied to these types of loans to determine the appropriate level for the ALL. Adjustments may be made to these allocations that reflect management's judgment on current conditions, delinquency trends, and charge-off activity. Based on the above discussion, management believes that the ALL is currently adequate, but not excessive, given the risk inherent in the loan portfolio.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary assets and liabilities of the Bancorp are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Bancorp's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or magnitude as the prices of goods and services.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words or phrases would be,\u201d will allow,\u201d intends to,\u201d will likely result,\u201d are expected to,\u201d will continue,\u201d is anticipated,\u201d estimate,\u201d project,\u201d or similar expressions are also intended to identify forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The Bancorp cautions readers that forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those relating to the Bancorp's future business prospects, interest income and expense, net income, liquidity, and capital needs are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, due to, among other things, factors identified in this report.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Bancorp's earnings are dependent upon the earnings of the Bank. The Bank's earnings are primarily dependent upon net interest margin. The net interest margin is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings stated as a percentage of average interest earning assets. The net interest margin is perhaps the clearest indicator of a financial institution's ability to generate core earnings. Fees and service charges, wealth management operations income, gains and losses from the sale of assets, provisions for loan losses, income taxes and operating expenses also affect the Bancorp's profitability.\nA summary of the Bancorp's significant accounting policies are detailed in Note 1 to the Bancorp's consolidated financial statements included in this report. Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the disclosures provided. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates associated with the allowance for loan losses, fair values of foreclosed real estate, loan servicing rights, investment securities, deferred tax assets, goodwill, and the status of contingencies are particularly susceptible to material change in the near term.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Bancorp had total assets of $1.1 billion and total deposits of $929.8 million. The Bancorp's deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) that is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an agency of the federal government. At December 31, 2018, stockholders' equity totaled $101.5 million, with book value per share at $33.50. Net income for 2018 was $9.3 million, or $3.17 basic and diluted earnings per common share. The return on average assets was 0.93%, while the return on average stockholders' equity was 9.88%.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of First Personal Financial Corp. On July 26, 2018, the Bancorp completed its previously announced acquisition of First Personal Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation ( First Personal\u201d) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 20, 2018 (the First Personal Merger Agreement\u201d) between the Bancorp and First Personal. Pursuant to the terms of the First Personal Merger Agreement, First Personal merged with and into the Bancorp, with the Bancorp as the surviving corporation (the First Personal Merger\u201d). Simultaneous with the First Personal Merger, First Personal Bank, an Illinois state chartered commercial bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of First Personal, merged with and into Peoples Bank SB, with Peoples Bank as the surviving institution. The acquisition represented the Bank's first expansion into the South Suburban Chicagoland market, and expanded the Bank's full-service retail banking network to 19 banking centers.\nIn connection with the First Personal Merger, each First Personal stockholder holding 100 or more shares of First Personal common stock received fixed consideration of (i) 0.1246 shares of Bancorp common stock, and (ii) $6.67 per share in cash for each outstanding share of First Personal common stock. Stockholders holding less than 100 shares of First Personal common stock received $12.12 in cash and no stock consideration for each outstanding share of First Personal common stock. Any fractional shares of Bancorp common stock that a First Personal stockholder would have otherwise received in the First Personal Merger were cashed out in the amount of such fraction multiplied by $42.95.\nThe Bancorp issued a total of 161,875 shares of Bancorp common stock to the former First Personal stockholders, and paid cash consideration of approximately $8.7 million. Based upon the closing price of Bancorp's common stock on July 25, 2018, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately $15.6 million.\nAcquisition of AJS Bancorp, Inc. On January 24, 2019, the Bancorp completed its acquisition of AJS Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation ( AJSB\u201d), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 30, 2018 (the AJSB Merger Agreement\u201d) between the Bancorp and AJSB. Pursuant to the terms of the AJSB Merger Agreement, AJSB merged with and into the Bancorp, with the Bancorp as the surviving corporation (the AJSB Merger\u201d). Simultaneous with the AJSB Merger, A.J. Smith Federal Savings Bank, a federally chartered savings bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of AJSB, merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving institution.\n Page 34 of 91 \nIn connection with the AJSB Merger, each AJSB stockholder holding 100 or more shares of AJSB common stock received fixed consideration of (i) 0.2030 shares of the Bancorp common stock, and (ii) $7.20 per share in cash for each outstanding share of AJSB common stock. Stockholders holding less than 100 shares of AJSB common stock received $16.00 in cash and no stock consideration for each outstanding share of AJSB common stock. Any fractional shares of Bancorp common stock that an AJSB stockholder would have otherwise received in the AJSB Merger were cashed out in the amount of such fraction multiplied by $43.01.\nThe Bancorp issued 416,478 shares of Bancorp common stock to the former AJSB stockholders, and paid cash consideration of approximately $15.4 million. Based upon the closing price of the Bancorp's common stock on January 23, 2019, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately $34.2 million, which includes unallocated shares held by the AJSB Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP\u201d), some of which were cancelled in connection with the closing to satisfy the ESOP's outstanding loan balance. As a result of the acquisition, the Bank was able to further expand its retail banking network in the South Suburban Chicagoland market, bringing the total number of its full-service banking centers to 22.\nFinancial Condition\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, total assets increased by $168.9 million (18.2%), to $1.1 billion, with interest-earning assets increasing by $146.9 million (16.9%). At December 31, 2018, interest-earning assets totaled $1.0 billion and represented 92.9% of total assets. Loans totaled $764.4 million and represented 75.1% of interest-earning assets, 69.7% of total assets and 82.2% of total deposits. The loan portfolio, which is the Bancorp's largest asset, is a significant source of both interest and fee income.\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Loans </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>253,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multifamily </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans receivable </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>764,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 620,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustable rate loans / loans receivable </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>437,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>348,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans receivable to total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans receivable to earning assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans receivable to total deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bancorp is primarily a portfolio lender. Mortgage banking activities historically have been limited to the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans with contractual maturities greater than 15 years. These loans are identified as held for sale when originated and sold, on a loan-by-loan basis, in the secondary market. The Bancorp will also retain fixed rate mortgage loans with a contractual maturity greater than 15 years on a limited basis. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Bancorp originated $55.5 million in new fixed rate mortgage loans for sale, compared to $42.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Net gains realized from the mortgage loan sales totaled $1.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the Bancorp had $2.9 million in loans that were classified as held for sale, compared to $1.6 million at December 31, 2017.\n Page 35 of 91 \nNon-performing loans include those loans that are 90 days or more past due and accruing and those loans that have been placed on non-accrual status.

Typically, management does not individually classify smaller-balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgages or consumer loans, as impaired, unless they are troubled debt restructurings.\nPurchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date. Purchased loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination are considered purchased credit impaired loans. Expected future cash flows at the purchase date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable ( accretable yield\u201d). The difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference and represents probable losses in the portfolio. In determining the acquisition date fair value of purchased credit impaired loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Bancorp aggregates these purchased loans into pools of loans by common risk characteristics, such as credit risk rating and loan type. Subsequent to the purchase date, increases in cash flows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses.\nThe Bancorp's impaired loans, including purchased credit impaired loans, are summarized below:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,152 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>512 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multifamily </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>724 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,522 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt times, the Bancorp will modify the terms of a loan to forego a portion of interest or principal or reduce the interest rate on the loan to a rate materially less than market rates, or materially extend the maturity date of a loan as part of a troubled debt restructuring. The valuation basis for the Bancorp's troubled debt restructurings is based on the present value of expected future cash flows; unless consistent cash flows are not present, then the fair value of the collateral securing the loan is the basis for valuation.\n Page 37 of 91 \nThe Bancorp's troubled debt restructured loans are summarized below:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>303 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multifamily </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>535 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the troubled debt restructure loans reflected in the table above for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was the result of a $1.1 million commercial relationship as well as eight residential or home equity loans totaling $301 thousand which were modified as part of a troubled debt restructure or renewed with cash flow difficulties. The $1.1 million relationship was classified as substandard and remains in accrual status.\nThe increase in the nonperforming, substandard, special mention, and impaired loans reflected in the tables above for the twelve months ending December 31, 2018, are the result of the completion of the acquisition of First Personal as well as two commercial relationships, one commercial real estate customer and one First Federal residential customer which were all not related to the acquisition. First Personal loans totaling $612 thousand, one $523 thousand First Federal residential loan and one $464 thousand commercial real estate loan contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in nonperforming loans. One $1.1 million commercial relationship, First Personal loans totaling $721 thousand, one $523 thousand First Federal residential loan and one $464 thousand commercial real estate loan contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in substandard loans. First Personal loans totaling $2.8 million and one $2.1 million commercial relationship contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in watch loans, which was offset by the payoff of one $2.3 million commercial real estate loan. First Personal purchased credit impaired loans totaling $2.3 million, one $1.1 million commercial relationship and one $464 thousand commercial real estate loan contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in impaired loans.\nAt December 31, 2018, management is of the opinion that there are no loans, except certain of those discussed above, where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which will imminently result in such loans being classified as past due, non-accrual or a troubled debt restructure. Management does not presently anticipate that any of the non-performing loans or classified loans would materially affect future operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nThe allowance for loan losses (ALL) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses, increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs net of recoveries. A loan is charged off against the allowance by management as a loss when deemed uncollectible, although collection efforts continue and future recoveries may occur. The determination of the amounts of the ALL and provisions for loan losses is based on management's current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio with consideration given to all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability as of the reporting date. The appropriateness of the current period provision and the overall adequacy of the ALL are determined through a disciplined and consistently applied quarterly process that reviews the Bancorp's current credit risk within the loan portfolio and identifies the required allowance for loan losses given the current risk estimates.\n Page 38 of 91 \nThe Bancorp's provision for loan losses for the twelve months ended are summarized below:\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>413 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(73 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multifamily </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(150 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>749 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bancorp's charge-off and recovery information is summarized below:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>Charge-off </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Recoveries </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Charge-offs </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(194 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(193 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(119 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(95 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multifamily </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(592 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(458 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(58 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,011 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(828 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ALL provisions take into consideration management's current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio, loan portfolio balances, changes in the portfolio mix and local economic conditions. In determining the provision for loan losses for the current period, management has considered risks associated with the local economy, changes in loan balances and mix, and asset quality.\nThe Bancorp's allowance to total loans and non-performing loans are summarized below:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Allowance for loan losses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,482 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>764,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>620,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-performing loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,223 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ALL-to-total loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ALL-to-non-performing loans (coverage ratio) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe December 31, 2018 balance in the ALL account is considered adequate by management after evaluation of the loan portfolio, past experience and current economic and market conditions. While management may periodically allocate portions of the allowance for specific problem loans, the whole allowance is available for any loan charge offs that occur. The allocation of the ALL reflects performance and growth trends within the various loan categories, as well as consideration of the facts and circumstances that affect the repayment of individual loans, and loans which have been pooled as of the evaluation date, with particular attention given to non-performing loans and loans which have been classified as substandard, doubtful or loss. Management has allocated reserves to both performing and non-performing loans based on current information available.\n Page 39 of 91 \nAt December 31, 2018, foreclosed real estate totaled $1.6 million, which was comprised of twenty-four properties, compared to $1.7 million and sixteen properties at December 31, 2017. During 2018, loans totaling $282 thousand were transferred into foreclosed real estate, approximately $1.3 million of foreclosed real estate resulted from the First Personal acquisition, while net sales of foreclosed real estate totaled $1.6 million. Net gains from the 2018 sales totaled $54 thousand. Market value adjustments in 2018 of $135 thousand were also made. At the end of December 2018 all of the Bancorp's foreclosed real estate is located within its primary market area.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Bancorp's investment portfolio totaled $241.8 million and was invested as follows: 56.0% in U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, 38.9% in municipal securities, 3.3% in U.S. government agency debt securities, 0.8% in trust preferred securities, and 1% in a money market fund. During 2018, securities decreased by $2.7 million (1.1%). The decrease in the securities portfolio during the year is a result of market value adjustments for unrealized losses and the reallocation of funds to support loan growth. In addition, at December 31, 2018, the Bancorp had $3.5 million in FHLB stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Bancorp's three investments in trust preferred securities are in payment in kind\u201d status. Payment in kind status results in a temporary delay in the payment of interest. As a result of a delay in the collection of the interest payments, management placed these securities on non-accrual status. At December 31, 2018, the cost basis of the three trust preferred securities on non-accrual status totaled $3.5 million.\nDeposits are a fundamental and cost-effective source of funds for lending and other investment purposes. The Bancorp offers a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers, with the primary focus on building and expanding relationships. At December 31, 2018, deposits totaled $929.8 million. During 2018, deposits increased by $136.8 million (17.2%). The 2018 change in deposits was comprised of the following: certificates of deposit increased by $75.0 million (40.8%), checking accounts increased by $32.6 million (10.6%), savings accounts increased by $30.8 million (23.7%), and money market deposit accounts (MMDA's) decreased by $1.6 million (1.0%). Deposit balances increased for the year as a result of the First Personal acquisition. When adjusted for the First Personal acquisition, overall deposits decreased.\nThe Bancorp's borrowed funds are primarily comprised of repurchase agreements and FHLB advances that are used to fund asset growth not supported by deposit generation. At December 31, 2018, borrowed funds totaled $43.0 million compared to $20.8 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $22.1 million (105.9%). Borrowed funds increased as FHLB advances were utilized for funding loan originations. Retail repurchase agreements totaled $11.6 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $11.3 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $328 thousand (2.9%). FHLB advances totaled $43.0 million, increasing $25.9 million or 151.5%. The Bancorp did not carry a balance on the FHLB line of credit at December 31, 2018, compared to a $3.2 million balance at December 31, 2017. The Bancorp did not have any other borrowings at December 31, 2018, compared to $600 thousand at December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the Bancorp, liquidity management refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash to fund current loan demand, meet deposit withdrawals, and pay dividends and operating expenses. Because profit and liquidity are often conflicting objectives, management attempts to maximize the Bank's net interest margin by making adequate, but not excessive, liquidity provisions. Furthermore, funds are managed so that future profits will not be significantly impacted as funding costs increase.\nChanges in the liquidity position result from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities are generally the cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the determination of net income. The primary investing activities include loan originations, loan repayments, investments in interest bearing balances in financial institutions, and the purchase, sale, and maturity of investment securities. Financing activities focus almost entirely on the generation of customer deposits. In addition, the Bancorp utilizes borrowings (i.e., repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and federal funds purchased) as a source of funds.\n Page 40 of 91 \nDuring 2018, cash and cash equivalents increased $6.1 million compared to a decrease of $33.2 million for 2017. During 2018, the primary sources of cash and cash equivalents were from the acquisition of First Personal, maturities and sales of securities, loan sales and repayments, FHLB advances, and cash from operating activities. The primary uses of cash and cash equivalents were for the purchase of First Personal, loan originations, purchases of securities, FHLB advance repayments, and the payment of common stock dividends. During 2018, cash from operating activities totaled $6.4 million, compared to $12.3 million for 2017. The decrease in cash in-flow from operating activities was primarily a result of accrued expenses and other liabilities related to the First Personal acquisition. Cash outflows from investing activities totaled $31.2 million during 2018, compared to outflows of $47.8 million during 2017. The changes for the current year were related to decreased purchases of securities and in-take of cash and cash equivalents from acquisition activity. Net cash inflows from financing activities totaled $30.9 million in 2018, compared to net cash inflows of $2.3 million in 2017. The increase during 2018 was primarily due to the increase in deposits and borrowed funds. On a cash basis, the Bancorp paid dividends on common stock of $3.4 million and $3.3 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. During 2018, the Bancorp's Board of Directors increased dividends as earnings and capital continued to be sufficient to warrant dividend increases.\nManagement strongly believes that safety and soundness is enhanced by maintaining a high level of capital. Stockholders' equity totaled $101.5 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $92.1 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $9.4 million (10.2%). The increase was primarily the result of net income of $9.3 million and issuance of $6.9 million shares related to the acquisition of First Personal less $3.5 million in cash dividends and net unrealized loss of available for sale securities of $3.5 million. At December 31, 2018, book value per share was $33.50 compared to $32.14 for 2017.\nThe Bancorp is subject to risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the FRB, and the Bank is subject to risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the FDIC. As applied to the Bancorp and the Bank, the FRB and FDIC capital requirements are substantially the same. These regulations divide capital into various tiers, as described in Recent Developments - Regulatory Capital Rules\u201d above. The following table shows that, at December 31, 2018, the Bancorp's capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The dollar amounts are in millions.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Minimum Required To Be </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Minimum Required For </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Well Capitalized Under Prompt </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Capital Adequacy Purposes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Corrective Action Regulations </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>At December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratio </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total capital to risk-weighted assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows that, at December 31, 2018, the Bank's capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.

Under Indiana law, the Bank may pay dividends from its undivided profits (generally, earnings less losses, bad debts, taxes and other operating expenses) as is considered expedient by the Bank's Board of Directors. However, the Bank must obtain the approval of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would exceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, retained net income,\u201d means net income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. An exemption from DFI approval would require that the Bank have been assigned a composite uniform financial institutions rating of 1 or 2 as a result of the most recent federal or state examination; the proposed dividend would not result in a Tier 1 leverage ratio below 7.5%; and that the Bank not be subject to any corrective action, supervisory order, supervisory agreement, or board approved operating agreement. The aggregate amount of dividends that may be declared by the Bank in 2019, without the need for qualifying for an exemption or prior DFI approval, is $1.5 million plus 2019 net profits. Moreover, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the payment of dividends if it determines that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank. On December, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Bancorp declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.30 per share. The Bancorp's fourth quarter dividend was paid to shareholders on January 8, 2019.\n Page 41 of 91 \nResults of Operations -\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\nNet income for 2018 was $9.3 million, compared to $9.0 million for 2017, an increase of $376 thousand (4.2%). The twelve-month earnings increase is related to strong loan originations as well as the effects of the merger with First Personal and the tax effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that, among other changes, reduces the corporate federal income tax rate from 34% to 21% and was effective January 1, 2018. The earnings represent a return on average assets of 0.93% for 2018 compared to 0.98% for 2017. The return on average equity was 9.88% for 2018 compared to 9.90% for 2017.\nNet interest income for 2018 was $34.4 million, an increase of $3.6 million (11.7%) from $30.8 million for 2017. During the year, the Bancorp's yield on interest earning assets was positively impacted by higher yields, while interest expense was driven higher primarily by deposit account growth and an increased cost of funds. The weighted-average yield on interest-earning assets was 4.22% for 2018 compared to 3.91% for 2017. The weighted-average cost of funds was 0.57% for 2018 compared to 0.32% for 2017. The impact of the 4.22% return on interest earning assets and the 0.57% cost of funds resulted in a net interest spread of 3.65% for 2018, compared to a net interest spread of 3.59% for 2017. During 2018, total interest income increased by $6.1 million (18.3%) while total interest expense increased by $2.5 million (96.4%). The net interest margin was 3.67% for 2018, compared to 3.61% for 2017. The Bancorp's tax equivalent net interest margin for 2018 was 3.81% compared to 3.84% for 2017.\nDuring 2018, interest income from loans increased by $5.5 million (20.6%) compared to 2017. The increase in interest income from loans is a result of strong loan originations as well as the effects of the merger with First Personal. The weighted-average yield on loans outstanding was 4.71% for 2018 compared to 4.45% for 2017. Loan balances averaged $687.2 million for 2018, an increase of $83.3 million (13.8%) from $603.9 million for 2017. During 2018, interest income from securities and other interest earning assets increased by $559 thousand (8.6%) compared to 2017. The weighted-average yield on securities and other interest earning assets was 2.84% for 2018 compared to 2.61% for 2017. Securities and other interest earning assets averaged $248.4 million for 2018, down $173 thousand (0.1%) from $248.6 million for 2017.\nInterest expense for deposits increased by $1.7 million (84.5%) during 2018 compared to 2017. The change was due to an increase in the weighted-average rate paid on deposits and increased balances from the acquisition of First Personal as well as internal sales efforts. The weighted-average rate paid on deposits for 2018 was 0.45% compared to 0.27% for 2017. Total deposit balances averaged $839.5 million for 2018, an increase of $69.3 million (9.0%) from $770.2 million for 2017. Interest expense for borrowed funds increased by $696 thousand (165.7%) during 2018 compared to 2017. The change was due to strong loan originations, some of which were funded with borrowed funds. The weighted-average cost of borrowed funds was 2.25% for 2018 compared to 1.27% for 2017. Borrowed funds averaged $57.4 million during 2018, an increase of $15.3 million (35.4%) from $42.1 million for 2017.\nNoninterest income for 2018 was $9.1 million, an increase of $1.3 million (17.4%) from $7.8 million for 2017. During 2018, fees and service charges totaled $3.9 million, an increase of $555 thousand (16.8%) from $3.3 million for 2017. The increase in fees and service charges is the result of the Bancorp's growing depository base and enhanced product offerings. Fees from Wealth Management operations totaled $1.70 million for 2018, a decrease of $15 thousand (0.8%) from $1.70 million for 2017. Gains from loan sales totaled $1.6 million for the current year, an increase of $419 thousand (34.9%), compared to $1.2 million for 2017. The increase in gains from the sale of loans is a result of increased originations for the year. Gains from the sale of securities totaled $1.2 million for the current year, an increase of $340 thousand (39.5%) from $860 thousand for 2017. Current market conditions continue to provide opportunities to manage securities cash flows, while recognizing gains from the sales of securities. In 2018, $494 thousand from the increase in the cash value of bank owned life insurance was recorded, an increase of $34 thousand (7.4%) compared to $460 thousand for 2017. The increase in the cash value of bank owned life insurance is a result of the acquisition of First Personal. For 2018, foreclosed real estate sales gains totaled $54 thousand, an decrease of $49 thousand (47.6%) from $103 thousand for 2017. During 2018, other noninterest income totaled $170 thousand, an increase of $63 thousand (58.9%) from $107 thousand for 2017. Rental income from REO properties was the main reason for the increase in other noninterest income for 2018.\n Page 42 of 91 \nNoninterest expense for 2018 was $31.4 million, up $5.9 million (23.1%) from $25.5 million for 2017. During 2018, compensation and benefits totaled $16.4 million, an increase of $2.2 million (15.4%) from $14.2 million for 2017. The increase in compensation and benefits is the result of the Bancorp's ordinary course, annual adjustments to salaries, as well as increases due to the acquisition of First Personal. Occupancy and equipment expense totaled $3.7 million for 2018, an increase of $372 thousand (11.3%) compared to $3.3 million for 2017. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense is the result of higher building operating expenses, as well as increases due to the acquisition of First Personal. Data processing expense totaled $2.5 million for 2018, an increase of $1.0 million (69.8%) from $1.5 million for 2017. Data processing expense has increased as a result of increased system utilization, as well as increases due to the acquisition of First Personal. Marketing expense related to banking products totaled $707 thousand for the year, an increase of $112 thousand (18.8%) from $595 thousand for 2017. The increase in marketing expense is primarily related to the acquisition of First Personal. Federal deposit insurance premiums totaled $410 thousand for 2018, an increase of $74 thousand (22.0%) from $336 thousand for 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of First Personal that resulted in a higher assessment base. Statement and check processing expense totaled $414 thousand for the year, an increase of $31 thousand (8.1%) from $383 thousand for 2017. Professional service expense totaled $713 thousand for the year, an increase of $270 thousand (60.9%) from $443 thousand for 2017. The increase in professional services was directly related to cost associated with the acquisition of First Personal. Other expenses related to banking operations totaled $6.6 million for 2018, an increase of $1.8 million (38.3%) from $4.8 million for 2017. The increase in other operating expenses is primarily related to the acquisition of First Personal and accounts for approximately $609 thousand of one-time expenses and approximately $301 thousand of ongoing expenses that make up the increase for the year ended December 31, 2018. The remainder of the increase in other noninterest expense is primarily related to a shared loss of $125 thousand from the operation of the wholly-owned subsidiary NWIN Risk Management, Inc. (a captive insurance subsidiary), as well as generally higher third party costs. The Bancorp's efficiency ratio for 2018 was 72.21% compared to 66.17% for 2017. The weaker efficiency ratio is primarily the result of one-time costs associated with the acquisition of First Personal. The ratio is determined by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and total noninterest income for the period.\nThe Bancorp had an income tax expense for 2018 of $1.4 million compared to income tax expense of $2.9 million for 2017, a decrease to expense of $1.4 million (50.2%). The combined effective federal and state tax rates for the Bancorp were 13.3% for 2018 and 24.3% for 2017. The Bancorp's lower current period effective tax rate is a result of the revaluation of the Bancorp's net deferred tax asset during December 2017, that resulted in a one-time write down of $517 thousand that was recorded as additional income tax expense. Current period tax expense was also positively impacted by the TCJA that, among other changes, reduces the top corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to a flat rate of 21% and was effective January 1, 2018. A valuation allowance remains for certain other state tax credits that management does not believe will be fully utilized before statutory expiration.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the Bancorp's financial condition and that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The Bancorp's most critical accounting policies are summarized below. Other accounting policies, including those related to the fair values of financial instruments and the status of contingencies, are summarized in Note 1 to the Bancorp's consolidated financial statements.\nValuation of Investment Securities - The fair values of securities available for sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or pricing models utilizing significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different estimates of value. In certain cases where market data is not readily available because of lack of market activity or little public disclosure, values may be based on unobservable inputs and classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n Page 43 of 91 \nAt the end of each reporting period securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with the Investments - Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. Significant judgments are required in determining impairment, which include making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments, loss assumptions and the change in interest rates.\nWe consider the following factors when determining an other-than-temporary impairment for a security: The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future; and an assessment of whether the Bancorp has (1) the intent to sell the debt securities or (2) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt securities before its anticipated market recovery. If either of these conditions is met, management will recognize other-than-temporary impairment. If, in management's judgment, an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written down for the credit loss, and the unrealized loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings. Management will utilize an independent valuation specialist to value securities semi-annually for other-than-temporary impairment.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - The Bancorp maintains an Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) to absorb probable incurred credit losses that arise from the loan portfolio. The ALL is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs net of recoveries. The determination of the amounts of the ALL and provisions for loan losses is based upon management's current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio with consideration given to all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability. The methodology used to determine the current year provision and the overall adequacy of the ALL includes a disciplined and consistently applied quarterly process that combines a review of the current position with a risk assessment worksheet. Factors that are taken into consideration in the analysis include an assessment of national and local economic trends, a review of current year loan portfolio growth and changes in portfolio mix, and an assessment of trends for loan delinquencies and loan charge-off activity. Particular attention is given to non-accruing loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more, and loans that have been classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss. Changes in the provision are directionally consistent with changes in observable data.\nCommercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans that exhibit credit weaknesses and loans that have been classified as impaired are subject to an individual review. Where appropriate, ALL allocations are made to these loans based on management's assessment of financial position, current cash flows, collateral values, financial strength of guarantors, industry trends, and economic conditions. ALL allocations for homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, are based on historical charge-off activity and current delinquency trends. Management has allocated general reserves to both performing and non-performing loans based on historical data and current information available.\nRisk factors for non-performing and internally classified loans are based on an analysis of either the projected discounted cash flows or the estimated collateral liquidation value for individual loans defined as substandard or doubtful. Estimated collateral liquidation values are based on established loan underwriting standards and adjusted for current mitigating factors on a loan-by-loan basis. Aggregate substandard loan collateral deficiencies are determined for residential, commercial real estate, commercial business, and consumer loan portfolios. These deficiencies are then stated as a percentage of the total substandard balances to determine the appropriate risk factors.\nRisk factors for performing and non-classified loans are based on a weighted average of net charge-offs for the most recent three years, which are then stated as a percentage of average loans for the same period. Historical risk factors are calculated for residential, commercial real estate, commercial business, and consumer loans. The three year weighted average historical factors are then adjusted for current subjective risks attributable to: regional and national economic factors; loan growth and changes in loan composition; organizational structure; composition of loan staff; loan concentrations; policy changes and out of market lending activity.\n Page 44 of 91 \nThe risk factors are applied to these types of loans to determine the appropriate level for the ALL. Adjustments may be made to these allocations that reflect management's judgment on current conditions, delinquency trends, and charge-off activity. Based on the above discussion, management believes that the ALL is currently adequate, but not excessive, given the risk inherent in the loan portfolio.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary assets and liabilities of the Bancorp are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Bancorp's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or magnitude as the prices of goods and services.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
