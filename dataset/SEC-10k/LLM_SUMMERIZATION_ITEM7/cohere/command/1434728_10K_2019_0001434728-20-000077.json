We seek to deploy our integrated approach, which we refer to as \"Total Water Management,\" a term we use to mean managing the entire water cycle by owning and operating the water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities within the same geographic areas in order to both conserve water and maximize its total economic and social value. We use Total Water Management to promote sustainable communities in areas where we expect growth to outpace the existing potable water supply. Our model focuses on the broad issues of water supply and scarcity and applies principles of water conservation through water recycling and leveraging advanced systems. Our basic premise is that the world's water supply is limited and yet can be stretched significantly through effective planning, the use of recycled water, and by providing individuals and communities resources that promote wise water usage practices.\nBusiness Outlook\n2018 and 2019 continued the trend of positive growth in new connections. According to the 2010 U.S. Census Data, the Phoenix metropolitan statistical area ( MSA\u201d) is the 14th largest MSA in the U.S. and had a population of 4.2 million, an increase of 29% over the 3.3 million people reported in the 2000 Census. Metropolitan Phoenix continues to grow due to its low-cost housing, excellent weather, large and growing universities, a diverse employment base, and low taxes. The Employment and Population Statistics Department of the State of Arizona predicts that the Phoenix Metropolitan area will have a population of 5.7 million people by 2030 and 6.5 million by 2040. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, Arizona's employment rate improved by 2.9%, ranking the state in the top two nationally for job growth.\nAlso, according to the W.P. Carey School of Business Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Real Estate Consensus Panel, most sectors of real estate are expected to experience improved growth with industrial and retail sectors also expected to experience improved occupancy rates. For Maricopa County and Pinal County combined, the Homebuilders Association of Central Arizona reported that single family housing permits grew 14% to 25,127 units in 2019.\nThe forecast by the Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Real Estate Consensus Panel for 2020 remains positive at approximately 26,000 single family dwelling permits. From there, we believe growth in the region could steadily return towards its normal historical rate of greater than 30,000 single family dwelling permits.\nWe believe that our utilities and service areas are directly in the anticipated path of growth primarily in the metropolitan Phoenix area. Market data indicates that our service areas currently incorporate a large portion of the final platted lots, partially finished lots, and finished lots in metropolitan Phoenix. Management believes that we are well-positioned to benefit from the near-term growth in metropolitan Phoenix due to the availability of lots and existing infrastructure in place within our services areas.\nFactors Affecting our Results of Operations\nOur financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industry-wide factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022population and community growth;\n\u2022economic and environmental utility regulation;\n\u2022economic environment;\n\u2022the need for infrastructure investment;\n\u2022production and treatment costs;\n\u2022weather and seasonality; and\n\u2022access to and quality of water supply.\nWe are subject to economic regulation by the state regulator, the Arizona Corporation Commission ( ACC\u201d). The U.S. federal and state governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. We continue to execute on our strategy to optimize and focus the Company in order to provide greater value to our customers and shareholders by aiming to deliver predictable financial results, making prudent capital investments, and focusing our efforts on earning an appropriate rate of return on our investments.\nPopulation and Community Growth\nPopulation and community growth in the metropolitan Phoenix area served by our utilities have a direct impact on our earnings. An increase or decrease in our active service connections will affect our revenues and variable expenses in a corresponding manner. Our total service connections, including both active service connections and connections to vacant homes, increased 1,908 connections, or 4.3%, from a total of 44,289 as of December 31, 2018 to 46,197 as of December 31, 2019. This increase is due primarily to the positive growth in new connections.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have 45,823 active service connections compared to 43,687 active service connections as of December 31, 2018, an increase of 2,136, or 4.9%. As with the increase in total service connections, the increase is due primarily to the growth in new connections. Approximately 92.9% of the 45,823 active service connections are serviced by our Global Water - Santa Cruz Water Company, LLC ( Santa Cruz\u201d) and Global Water - Palo Verde Utilities Company, LLC ( Palo Verde\u201d) utilities as of December 31, 2019.\nThe graph below presents the historical change in active and total connections for our ongoing operations, adjusting for the July 2015 condemnation of the assets and operations of Valencia Water Company (\"Valencia\") and the May 2016 sale of Willow Valley.\nEconomic and Environmental Utility Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive regulation of our rates by the ACC, which is charged with establishing rates based on the provision of reliable service at a reasonable cost while also providing an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on rate base for investors of utilities. The ACC uses a historical test year to evaluate whether the plant in service is used and useful, to assess whether costs were prudently incurred, and to set just and reasonable\u201d rates. Rate base is typically the depreciated original cost of the plant in service (net of contributions in aid of construction ( CIAC\u201d) and advances in aid of construction ( AIAC\u201d) which are funds or property provided to a utility under the terms of a main extension agreement, the value of which may be refundable), that has been determined to have been prudently invested\u201d and used and useful\u201d, although the reconstruction cost of the utility plant may also be considered in determining the rate base. The ACC also decides on an applicable capital structure based on actual or hypothetical analyses. The ACC determines a rate of return\u201d on that rate base, which includes the approved capital structure and the actual cost of debt and a fair and reasonable cost of equity based on the ACC's judgment. The overall revenue requirement for rate making purposes is established by multiplying the rate of return by the rate base and adding prudently\u201d incurred operating expenses for the test year, depreciation, and any applicable pro forma adjustments.\nTo ensure an optimal combination of access to water and water conservation balanced with a fair rate of return for investors, our water utility operating revenue is based on two components: a fixed fee and a consumption or volumetric fee. For our water utilities, the fixed fee, or basic service charge,\u201d provides access to water for residential usage and has generally been set at a level to produce 50% of total revenue. The volumetric fee is based on the total volume of water supplied to a given customer after the minimum number of gallons, if any, covered by the basic service charge, multiplied by a price per gallon set by a tariff approved by the ACC. A discount to the volumetric rate applies for customers that use less than an amount specified by the ACC. For all investor-owned water utilities, the ACC requires the establishment of inverted tier conservation oriented rates, meaning that the price of water increases as consumption increases. For wastewater utilities, wastewater collection, and treatment can be based on volumetric or fixed fees. Our wastewater utility services are billed based solely on a fixed fee, determined by the size of the water meter installed. Recycled water is sold on a volumetric basis with no fixed fee component.\nWe are required to file rate cases with the ACC to obtain approval for a change in rates. Rate cases and other rate-related proceedings can take a year or more to complete. As a result, there is frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time of a capital investment or incurrence of an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates. In normal conditions, it would not be uncommon to see us file for a rate increase every three years based on year one being the test year, year two being the rate case filing year, and year three being the rate case award year. However, based on our settlement with the ACC in 2014 and extended new rate phase-in period, we have not initiated the next rate case on this timeline. On March 20, 2019, we filed a motion with the ACC to request an order for certain of our utilities to file a rate case. Thereafter, on April 26, 2019, the ACC issued Decision No. 77168, which requires all of our utilities to file a rate case no later than June 30, 2020, using the twelve months ending December 31, 2019 as the test year for the rate case. Refer to -Rate Case Activity\u201d for additional information.\nOur water and wastewater operations are also subject to extensive United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, and discharge wastewater. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. The ACC also sets conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. We incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulation.\nEnvironmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently, and they have tended to become more stringent over time. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating expenses. We would generally expect to recover expenses associated with compliance for environmental and health and safety standards through rate increases, but this recovery may be affected by regulatory lag.\nEconomic Environment\nThe growth of our customer base depends almost entirely on the success of developers in developing residential and commercial properties within our service areas. Real estate development is a cyclical industry and development in our service areas is contingent upon construction or acquisition of major public improvements, such as arterial streets, drainage facilities, telephone and electrical facilities, recreational facilities, street lighting, and local in-tract improvements (e.g., site grading). Many of these improvements are built by municipalities with public financing, and municipal resources and access to capital may not be sufficient to support development in areas of rapid population growth. For additional information and risks associated with the economic environment, see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nInfrastructure Investment\nCapital expenditures for infrastructure investment are a component of the rate base on which our regulated utility subsidiaries are allowed to earn an equity return. Capital expenditures for infrastructure provide a basis for earnings growth by expanding our used and useful\u201d rate base, which is a component of our permitted return on investment and revenue requirement. We are generally able to recover a rate of return on these capital expenditures (return on equity and debt), together with debt service and certain operating costs, through the rates we charge.\nWe have made significant capital investments in our territories within the last sixteen years, and because the infrastructure remains in the early stages of its useful life, we do not expect comparable capital investments to be required in the near term, either for growth or to maintain the existing infrastructure. Nevertheless, we have an established capital improvement plan to make targeted capital investments to add capacity for growth in new service areas as required, repair and replace existing infrastructure as needed, address operating redundancy requirements, and improve our overall financial performance, by lowering expenses and increasing revenue. Additionally, to reduce our cash tax obligation associated with our deferred tax liability of approximately $19.4 million resulting from the gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, we have substantially completed the planned investments within our capital improvement plan that we determined will qualify under the Internal Revenue Code \u00a71033 re-investment criteria pursuant to a favorable Private Letter Ruling with the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\"). Refer to -Corporate Transactions-Private Letter Ruling\u201d for additional information.\nProduction and Treatment Costs\nOur water and wastewater services require significant production resources and therefore result in significant production costs. Although we are permitted to recover these costs through the rates we charge, regulatory lag can decrease our margins and earnings if production costs or other operating expenses increase significantly before we are able to recover them through increased rates. Our most significant costs include labor, chemicals used to treat water and wastewater, and power used to operate pumps and other equipment. Power and chemical costs can be volatile. However, we employ a variety of technologies and methodologies to minimize costs and maximize operational efficiencies. Additionally, with our Total Water Management approach, whereby we maximize the direct beneficial reuse of recycled water, we can realize significant treatment costs and power savings because smaller volumes of water are required for potable use. Many utilities require that all water be treated to potable standards irrespective of use. Total Water Management focuses on the right water for the right use. Potable water is needed for consumption and recycled water is acceptable for non-potable uses such as irrigation. Non-potable water does not need to be treated for commonly occurring and regulated constituents such as arsenic, or for other current or future human consumption health-based contaminants.\nWeather and Seasonality\nOur ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. Drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. Also, customer usage of water and recycled water is affected by weather conditions, particularly during the summer. Our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for irrigation and other outdoor uses. However, summer weather that is cooler or wetter than average generally suppresses customer water demand and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income. Conversely, when weather conditions are extremely dry, our business may be affected by government-issued drought-related warnings and/or water usage restrictions that would artificially lower customer demand and reduce our operating revenue. For additional information and risks associated with weather and seasonality, see Risk Factors,\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. The limited geographic diversity of our service areas makes the results of our operations more sensitive to the effect of local weather extremes. The second and third quarters of the year are generally those in which water services revenue and wastewater services revenues are highest. Accordingly, interim results should not be considered representative of the results of a full year.\nAccess to and Quality of Water Supply\nIn many areas of Arizona (including certain areas that we service), water supplies are limited and, in some cases, current usage rates exceed sustainable levels for certain water resources. We currently rely predominantly (and are likely to continue to rely) on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water for non-potable uses to meet future demands in our service areas. At present, groundwater (and recycled water derived from groundwater) is the primary water supply available to us. In addition, regulatory restrictions on the use of groundwater and the development of groundwater wells, lack of available water rights, drought, overuse of local or regional sources of water, protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors, including climate change, may limit the availability of ground or surface water. For additional information and risks associated with the access to and quality of water supply, see Risk Factors,\u201d included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nRate Case Activity\nOn July 9, 2012, we filed rate applications with the ACC to adjust the revenue requirements for seven utilities. In August 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the ACC staff, the Residential Utility Consumers Office, the City of Maricopa, and other parties to the rate case. The settlement required approval by the ACC before it could take effect. In February 2014, the rate case proceedings were completed and the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 74364, approving the settlement agreement. The collective rate increase included a 9.5% return on common equity which contributed to a 15% increase over revenue in 2011.\nFor our utilities, adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, the settlement provided for a collective aggregate revenue requirement increase of $3.6 million based on 2011 test year service connections, phased-in over time, with the first increase in January 2015 as follows (in thousands, not updated for the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA\u201d), refer to \"-Corporate Transactions-ACC Tax Docket\" for further details):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Incremental </td> <td> </td> <td>Cumulative </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,083 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 </td> <td>887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,970 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,305 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,640 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,975 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,645 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhereas this phase-in of additional revenues was determined using a 2011 test year, to the extent that the number of active service connections has increased and continues to increase from 2011 levels, the additional revenues may be greater than the amounts set forth above. On the other hand, if active connections decrease or we experience declining usage per customer, we may not realize all of the anticipated revenues.\nOn September 20, 2018, the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 76901, which set forth the reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Greater Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities due to the TCJA. Rate Decision No. 76901 adopted the phase-in approach for the reductions to match the phase-in of our revenue requirement under Rate Decision No. 74364. Refer to \"- Corporate Transactions - ACC Tax Docket\" for details regarding Decision No. 76901.\nACC Rate Case\nOn March 20, 2019, we filed a motion with the ACC to request an order for certain of our utilities to file a rate case. Thereafter, on April 26, 2019, the ACC issued Decision No. 77168, which requires all of our utilities to file a rate case no later than June 30, 2020, using the twelve months ending December 31, 2019 as the test year for the rate case. Refer to - Corporate Transactions - ACC Rate Case\u201d for additional information.\nICFA Treatment\nFrom 2003 to 2008, we entered into approximately 154 infrastructure coordination and financing agreements ( ICFAs\u201d) with developers and landowners covering approximately 275 square miles. Under these agreements, we have a contractual obligation to the developers and landowners to ensure that amongst other things, physical capacity exists through our regulated utilities for water and wastewater to the landowner/developer when needed. We receive fees from the landowner/developer for undertaking these obligations that typically are a negotiated amount per planned equivalent dwelling unit for the specified development or parcel of land. Payments are generally due to us from the landowner/developer based on progress of the development, with a portion due upon signing of the agreement, a portion due upon completion of certain milestones and the final payment due upon final plat approval or sale of the subdivision. The payments are non-refundable. Our investment can be considerable, as we may phase-in the construction of facilities in accordance with a regional master plan, as opposed to a single development.\nWith the issuance of Rate Decision No. 74364, in February 2014, the ACC changed how ICFA funds would be characterized and accounted for going forward. Most notably, the ACC changed the rate treatment of ICFA funds, now, ICFA funds already received or which had become due prior to the date of Rate Decision No. 74364 were accounted for in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy that had been in place prior to the 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision, wherein the funds received are recognized as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. Rate Decision No. 74364 prescribes that of the ICFA funds which come due and are paid subsequent to December 31, 2013, 70% of the ICFA funds will be recorded in the associated utility subsidiary as a hook-up fee ( HUF\u201d) liability, with the remaining 30% to be recorded as deferred revenue, until such time that the HUF tariff is fully funded, after which the remaining funds will be recorded as deferred revenue in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy. A HUF tariff, specifying the dollar value of a HUF for each utility, was\napproved by the ACC as part of Rate Decision No. 74364. We are responsible for assuring the full HUF value is paid from ICFA proceeds, and recorded in its full amount by predetermined milestones in Rate Decision No. 74364, even if it results in recording more or less than 30% of the ICFA fee as deferred revenue.\nWe account for the portion of future payments received under these agreements allocated to HUF liability as CIAC. However, from the regulator's perspective, HUFs do not impact rate base until the related funds are expended. These funds are segregated in a separate bank account and used to construct plant assets. The HUF liability is to be relieved once the funds are used for the construction of plant. For facilities required under a hook-up fee or ICFA, we must first use the HUF funds received, after which we may use debt or equity financing for the remainder of construction. The deferred revenue portion of these fees is recognized as revenue once the obligations specified within the applicable ICFA are met, including construction of sufficient operating capacity to serve the customers for which revenue was deferred.\nPursuant to Rate Decision No. 74364, we have agreed not to enter into any new ICFAs, and instead will utilize HUF tariffs, which have become an acceptable industry practice in Arizona. As part of the settlement, a HUF tariff was established for each utility. Existing ICFAs will remain in place, with 70% of future ICFA payments to be recorded as HUFs until the HUF liability is fully funded. The HUF liability is relieved as funds are expended to construct plant, at which time a corresponding amount is recorded to CIAC. The portion of ICFA proceeds not recorded as HUF will be recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy.\nIn addition to ICFAs, we have various line extension agreements with developers and builders, through which funds, water line extensions or wastewater line extensions are provided to us by the developers and are considered refundable advances for construction. These AIACs are subject to refund by us to the developers through annual payments that are computed as a percentage of the total annual gross revenue earned from customers connected to utility services constructed under the agreement over a specified period. Upon the expiration of the agreements' refunding period, the remaining balance of the AIAC becomes nonrefundable and at that time is considered CIAC. CIAC is amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated remaining life of the related utility plant. For rate-making purposes, a utility plant funded by AIAC and CIAC is excluded from rate base. The taxability of AIAC and CIAC was changed with the enactment of the TCJA. Previously, the majority of AIAC and CIAC that we collected were not taxable. However, with the enactment of the TCJA, they will be taxable going forward. On November 27, 2018, the ACC ruled that the utility may require that the contributor pay a gross-up to the utility consisting of 55% of the income tax expense with the utility covering the remaining 45% of the income tax expense. For more details regarding the ruling, refer to \"-Corporate Transactions - ACC Tax Docket.\"\nCorporate Transactions\nStipulated Condemnation of the Operations and Assets of Valencia\nOn July 14, 2015, we closed the stipulated condemnation to transfer the operations and assets of Valencia to the City of Buckeye. Terms of the condemnation were agreed upon through a settlement agreement and stipulated final judgment of condemnation wherein the City of Buckeye acquired all the operations and assets of Valencia and assumed operation of the utility upon close. The City of Buckeye paid the Company $55.0 million at close, plus an additional $0.1 million in working capital adjustments. The City of Buckeye is obligated to pay the Company a growth premium equal to $3,000 for each new water meter installed within Valencia's prior service areas in the City of Buckeye, for a 20-year period ending December 31, 2034, subject to a maximum payout of $45.0 million over the term of the agreement.\nSale of Loop 303 Contracts\nIn September 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell certain wastewater facilities main extension agreements and offsite water management agreements for the contemplated Loop 303 service area, along with their related rights and obligations (which we refer to collectively as the Loop 303 Contracts\u201d), relating to the 7,000-acre territory within a portion of the western planning area of the City of Glendale, Arizona known as the Loop 303 Corridor.\u201d Pursuant to the agreement, we sold the Loop 303 Contracts to EPCOR for total proceeds of approximately $4.1 million which was paid to us over time as certain milestones were met between EPCOR and the developers/landowners of the Loop 303 Corridor. As of December 31, 2018, we had received $3.1 million of the proceeds and in March 2019, we received the final payment of $1.0 million. These proceeds were recorded as other income.\nPrivate Letter Ruling\nOn June 2, 2016, we received a Private Letter Ruling from the IRS that, for purposes of deferring the approximately $19.4 million gain realized from the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, determined that the assets converted upon the condemnation of such assets could be replaced through certain reclamation facility improvements contemplated by the\nCompany under Internal Revenue Code \u00a71033 as property similar or related in service or use. In June 2016, the Company converted all operating subsidiaries from corporations to limited liability companies to take full advantage of the benefits of such ruling.\nPursuant to Internal Revenue Code \u00a71033, we would have been able to defer the gain on condemnation through the end of 2017. Following the Company's subsequent requests for extensions which were approved by the IRS, the Company may now defer the gain through the end of 2020. Accordingly, the Company expects to fully defer the remaining tax liability of approximately $0.1 million as of December 31, 2019 in 2020.\nLine of Credit\nOn April 20, 2018, we entered into an agreement with MidFirst Bank, a federally chartered savings association, for a two-year revolving line of credit up to $8.0 million. The credit facility, which will be used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes, bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%. In April 2019, we signed an amendment to the loan agreement which extends the maturity date from April 30, 2020 to April 30, 2022 and modifies the debt service coverage ratio to match the ratio required by the senior secured notes; all other terms remain unchanged. As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit line.\nAcquisition of Turner Ranches Water and Sanitation Company\nOn May 30, 2018, we acquired Turner Ranches Water and Sanitation Company (\"Turner\"), a non-potable irrigation water utility located in Mesa, Arizona for a purchase price of $2.8 million. At the time of acquisition, Turner had 963 residential irrigation connections and approximately seven square miles of service area. We believe this acquisition is consistent with the Company's declared strategy of making accretive acquisitions.\nACC Tax Docket\nOn December 20, 2017, the ACC opened a docket to address the utility ratemaking implications of the TCJA. The ACC subsequently approved an order in February 2018 requiring Arizona utilities to apply regulatory accounting treatment, which includes the use of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, to address all impacts from the enactment of the TCJA.\nOn September 20, 2018, the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 76901, which set forth the reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Greater Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities due to lower corporate tax rates under the TCJA. Rate Decision No. 76901 adopted a phase-in approach for the reductions to match the phase-in of our revenue requirement under the Rate Decision No. 74364 enacted in February 2014. In 2019, the annual reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Greater Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities were approximately $346,000, $523,000, $16,000, and $5,000, respectively. In 2021, the final year of the phase-in, the annual reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities will be approximately $415,000, $669,000, $16,000, and $5,000, respectively. The ACC also approved a carrying cost of 4.25% on regulatory liabilities resulting from the difference of the fully phased-in rates to be applied in 2021 versus the phased-in rates refunded in 2018.\nRate Decision No. 76901, however, did not address the impacts of the TCJA on accumulated deferred income taxes ( ADIT\u201d), including excess ADIT ( EADIT\u201d). Following the ACC's request for a proposal, the Company made its proposal in filings on December 19, 2018 and July 1, 2019. ACC Staff reviewed the Company's filing and requested that the Company defer tariff revisions until such revisions can be considered in the next rate case. ACC Staff also requested that the Company defer consideration of the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities associated with 2018 EADIT amortization. On July 18, 2019, the Company made a filing proposing these items be deferred to the next rate case. Refer to \" - Corporate Transactions - ACC Rate Case\" for additional information regarding the Company's next rate case.\nOn November 27, 2018, February 20, 2019, February 28, 2019, and January 23, 2020, the ACC adopted orders relating to the funding for income taxes on CIAC and AIAC (which became taxable for our regulated utilities under the TCJA). Those orders 1) require that under the hybrid sharing method, a contributor will pay a gross-up to the utility consisting of 55% of the income tax expense with the utility covering the remaining 45% of the income tax expense; 2) remove the full gross-up method option for Class A and B utilities and their affiliates (which includes all of our utilities); 3) ensure proper ratemaking treatment of a utility using the self-pay method; 4) clarify that pass-through entities that are owned by a C\u201d corporation can recover tax expense according to methods allowed; and 5) require Class A and B utilities to self-pay the taxes associated with hook-up fee contributions but permit using a portion of the hook-up fees to fund these taxes. The Company's utilities have adopted the hybrid sharing method for income tax on CIAC and AIAC.\nACC Rate Case\nOn March 20, 2019, we filed a motion with the ACC to request an order for certain of our utilities to file a rate case. Thereafter, on April 26, 2019, the ACC issued Decision No. 77168, which requires all of our utilities to file a rate case no later than June 30, 2020, using the twelve months ending December 31, 2019 as the test year for the rate case. The outcome of the new rate case cannot be predicted, but we anticipate that new rates would not take effect before the second half of 2021. We are in the initial stages of evaluating and preparing for the rate case, but we anticipate requesting a moderate increase in rates. There is no guarantee, however, that the ACC will approve a rate increase or take any other actions as a result of the rate case, and it is possible that the ACC may determine to decrease future rates.\n2018 Common Stock Offering\nOn July 20, 2018, we completed a public offering of 1,720,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $9.25 per share, for gross proceeds of $15.9 million, which included 220,000 shares issued and sold pursuant to the underwriter's exercise in full of its option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds of approximately $14.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, which collectively totaled $1.3 million.\nAcquisition of Red Rock Utilities\nOn October 16, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Red Rock, an operator of a water and a wastewater utility with service areas in Pima and Pinal counties of Arizona, for a purchase price of $5.9 million. The acquisition added over 1,650 connections and approximately 9 square miles of service area. The Company is obligated to pay to the seller a growth premium equal to $750 for each new account established within three specified growth premium areas, commencing in each area on the date of the first meter installation and ending on the earlier of ten years after such first installation date or twenty years from the acquisition date. The three specified growth premium areas are located in Pima County, Arizona where Red Rock has not yet begun operating, and where Red Rock is authorized to provide water utility services only. As of December 31, 2019, no meters have been installed and no accounts have been established in any of the three growth premium areas. We believe this acquisition is consistent with the Company's declared strategy of making accretive acquisitions.\nRecent Events\n2020 Common Stock Offering\nOn January 21, 2020, we completed a public offering of 870,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price per share of $12.50, for gross proceeds of $10.9 million. On January 30, 2020, we issued an additional 130,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $12.50 per share, for gross proceeds of $1.6 million, resulting in total proceeds from the offering of approximately $12.5 million. The issuance of the additional shares was completed pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriter's over-allotment option. We received net proceeds of approximately $11.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, which collectively totaled $0.9 million.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In consideration of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, we are not organized around specific products and services, geographic regions, or regulatory environments. We currently operate in one geographic region within the State of Arizona, wherein each operating utility operates within the same regulatory environment.\nWhile we report revenue, disaggregated by service type, on the face of our statement of operations, we do not manage the business based on any performance measure at the individual revenue stream level. We do not have any customers that contribute more than 10% to our revenues or revenue streams. Additionally, the chief operating decision maker uses consolidated financial information to evaluate our performance, which is the same basis on which he communicates our results and performance to our board of directors. It is upon this consolidated basis from which he bases all significant decisions regarding the allocation of our resources on a consolidated level. Based on the information described above and in accordance with the applicable literature, management has concluded that we are currently organized and operated as one operating and reportable segment.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses </td> <td>28,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>6,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense </td> <td>(3,575) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,384) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes </td> <td>3,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>(1,162) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,782) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic earnings per common share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues - The following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water services </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wastewater and recycled water services </td> <td>19,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unregulated revenues </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,517 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues remained consistent at $35.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. In 2018, $2.5 million in infrastructure coordination and financing agreements (ICFA) revenue was recognized, while no ICFA revenue was recognized in 2019. Excluding the ICFA revenue recognized, total revenues increased $2.4 million, or 7.3% for the full year 2019. The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by the Turner and Red Rock acquisitions combined with organic growth in connections.\nWater Services - Water services revenue increased $0.8 million, or 5.2%, to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in water services revenue is primarily due to the acquisitions of Red Rock and Turner coupled with organic growth and rate increases related to Rate Decision 74364.\nWater services revenue based on consumption increased $0.1 million, or 1.5%, to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in consumption revenue is primarily driven by the acquisitions of Turner and Red Rock.\nActive water connections increased 4.8% to 23,770 as of December 31, 2019 from 22,691 as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to growth in new connections.\nWater consumption increased 8.5% to 2.8 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2.6 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in consumption is primarily attributed to the acquisitions of Turner and Red Rock, partially offset by decreases in construction and commercial consumption.\nWater services revenue associated with the basic service charge, excluding miscellaneous charges, increased $0.7 million, or 8.6%, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase resulted from the Turner and Red Rock acquisitions coupled with an increase in organic active service connections, combined with an increase in rates related to Rate Decision No. 74364.\nWastewater and Recycled Water Services - Wastewater and recycled water services revenue increased $1.6 million, or 9.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in wastewater and recycled water services revenue is primarily driven by a $1.6 million increase in wastewater services revenue (inclusive of a $0.7 million increase due to Red Rock). The increase in wastewater services revenue is attributed to the increase in rates related\nto Rate Decision No. 74364, as well as the increase in active wastewater connections, which increased 5.0% to 22,053 as of December 31, 2019 from 20,996 as of December 31, 2018.\nRecycled water services revenue, which is based on the number of gallons delivered, increased $0.1 million, or 14.4%, to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in recycled water services revenue is primarily related to the increase in recycled water rates, partially offset by a decrease in consumption. The volume of recycled water delivered decreased 44 million gallons, or 6.5%, to 639 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 683 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2018. Recycled water rates increased 9.4% per Rate Decision No. 74364 compared to 2018.\nOperating Expenses - The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operations and maintenance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operations and maintenance - related party </td> <td>1,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>11,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation </td> <td>8,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperations and Maintenance - Operations and maintenance costs, consisting of personnel costs, production costs (primarily chemicals and purchased electrical power), maintenance costs, and property tax, increased $0.6 million, or 9.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTotal personnel expenses increased $0.4 million, or 20.4%, to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in personnel expense was primarily driven by the Turner and Red Rock acquisitions, and increases in salary and wages.\nProperty tax expense increased $0.1 million, or 4.5%, to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Property taxes are calculated using a centrally valued property calculation, which derives property values based upon three-year historical average revenues. As revenues increase, we expect property taxes to also increase. The increase is also partially due to the Turner and Red Rock acquisitions.\nOperations and maintenance - related party - Operations and maintenance - related party expense increased $0.1 million, or 4.9%, to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is due to the monthly rate per account owed for FATHOM service fees, which increased to $6.43 on January 1, 2019 from $6.24. The increase was also partially driven by the acquisition of Red Rock coupled with organic connection growth.\nGeneral and Administrative - General and administrative costs include the day-to-day expenses of office operations, personnel costs, legal and other professional fees, insurance, rent, and regulatory fees. These costs increased $0.7 million, or 6.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPersonnel related costs increased $0.4 million, or 12.3%, to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by an increase in salaries and bonuses due to the hiring of additional employees, coupled with an increase in other employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDeferred compensation expense increased $0.2 million, or 14.8%, to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to the higher increase in the carrying value of our equity awards due to the year over year change in our stock price, which increased $3.01 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an increase of $0.80 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was also caused by an increase in employee option expense due to the 2019 stock option grant, the value of which we started expensing in August 2019. Refer to Note 14 - Deferred Compensation Awards\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nProfessional fees decreased $0.2 million, or 8.3%, to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily related to expenses associated with strategic initiatives and TCJA analysis performed during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther Expense - Other expense totaled $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $0.8 million in other expense was primarily driven by the receipt of the final $1.0 million of proceeds in March 2019 relating to the Loop 303 contracts, partially offset by a decrease in the Valencia earn out of $0.2 million. The Valencia earnout consists of $3,000 for each new water meter installed within Valencia's prior service areas.\nOther - related party income increased $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Other - related party income includes royalty income based upon a percentage of certain FATHOM recurring revenue combined with the equity method gains and losses associated with our equity method investment in FATHOM Water Management Holdings, LLP (the \"FATHOM Partnership\"). As previously disclosed, based on the breach of the services agreement and cessation of services by GWM on December 20, 2019, the Company considers the services agreement to be terminated effective on that date. Additionally, the Company will no longer receive such royalty payments for periods after such date. The change in other - related party income was primarily driven by the equity method loss recorded on our investment in the FATHOM Partnership of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 6 - Equity Method Investment\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. The increase in Other - related party income was partially offset by a $63,000 decrease in royalty income for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense - Income tax expense of $1.2 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in pre-tax net income for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Income - Our net income totaled $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net income of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $0.9 million decrease was primarily attributed to ICFA revenue recognized in 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019, offset by Loop 303 proceeds and connection growth in 2019 compared to 2018.\nOutstanding Share Data\nAs of March 2, 2020, there were 22,537,381 shares of our common stock outstanding and options to acquire an additional 632,500 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur capital resources are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as debt and equity financing. Additionally, our regulated utility subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders, and real estate developers to partially fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. We use our capital resources to:\n\u2022fund operating costs;\n\u2022fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures;\n\u2022pay dividends;\n\u2022fund acquisitions;\n\u2022make debt and interest payments; and\n\u2022invest in new and existing ventures.\nOur utility subsidiaries operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited. Such recovery will take place over an extended period of time because recovery through rate increases is subject to regulatory lag.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have no notable near-term cash expenditures or debt obligations. While specific facts and circumstances could change, we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand, and the ability to draw on the $8.0 million available under the Loan Agreement (as defined below), to meet our operating cash flow requirements and capital expenditure plan as well as remain in compliance with our debt covenants for at least the next twelve months.\nIn March 2014, we initiated a dividend program to declare and pay a monthly dividend. On November 6, 2019, we announced a monthly dividend increase from $0.023861 per share ($0.286332 per share annually) to $0.0241 per share ($0.2892 per share annually). Although we expect monthly dividends will be declared and paid for the foreseeable future, the declaration of any dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and is subject to legal requirements and debt service ratio covenant requirements (refer to -Senior Secured Notes\" and \"-Revolving Credit Line\").\nCash from Operating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities are used for operating needs and to meet capital expenditure requirements. Our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by economic utility regulation, infrastructure investment, growth in service connections, customer usage of water, compliance with environmental health and safety standards, production costs, weather, and seasonality.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our net cash provided by operating activities totaled $11.6 million compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $0.3 million increase in cash from operating activities was primarily driven by the increase in other non-current liabilities of $0.9 million in 2019 compared to the $2.1 million decrease in 2018, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $0.9 million, coupled with a decrease in net income of $0.9 million.\nCash from Investing Activities\nOur net cash used in investing activities totaled $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $3.3 million change in cash used in investing activities was driven by a decrease in acquisition expenditures of $8.5 million due to the acquisition of Turner and Red Rock which were completed in 2018, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in capital expenditures primarily related to the deferral on the gain realized from the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia.\nWe continue to invest capital prudently in our existing, core service areas where we are able to deploy our Total Water Management model as service connections grow. This includes any required maintenance capital expenditures and the construction of new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities. Following the most recent Private Letter Ruling extension, we expect to fully defer the remaining tax liability of approximately $0.1 million as of December 31, 2019 in 2020 (refer to -Corporate Transactions-Private Letter Ruling\u201d). Our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.\nCash from Financing Activities\nOur net cash used in financing activities totaled $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a $15.1 million change as compared to the $9.5 million in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018. This change was primarily driven by the $14.6 million in net proceeds received from our public offering of stock in July 2018, combined with an increase in dividends paid of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was also due to a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercise of $0.4 million, offset by an increase of $0.4 million in AIAC payments received for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOn June 24, 2016, we issued two series of senior secured notes with a total principal balance of $115.0 million at a blended interest rate of 4.55%. Series A carries a principal balance of $28.8 million and bears an interest rate of 4.38% over a twelve-year term, with the principal payment due on June 15, 2028. Series B carries a principal balance of $86.3 million and bears an interest rate of 4.58% over a 20-year term. Series B is interest only for the first five years, with $1.9 million principal payments paid semiannually thereafter. The proceeds of the senior secured notes were primarily used to refinance our long-term tax exempt bonds, pursuant to an early redemption option at 103%, plus accrued interest, as a result of the initial public offering of our common stock in May 2016.\nThe senior secured notes require the Company to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated debt service of at least 1.10 to 1.00. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated as net income plus depreciation, taxes, interest and other non-cash charges net of non-cash income. Consolidated debt service is calculated as interest expense, principal payments, and dividend or stock repurchases. The senior secured notes also contain a provision limiting the payment of dividends if the Company falls below a debt service ratio of 1.25. However, for the quarter ending June 30, 2021 through the quarter ending March 31, 2024, the ratio drops to 1.20. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its financial debt covenants.\nDebt issuance costs as of both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were $0.6 million.\nRevolving Credit Line\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into a loan agreement (\"Loan Agreement\") with MidFirst Bank, a federally chartered savings association, on the terms and subject to conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement, for a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of $8.0 million. The Company intends to use the borrowings for future acquisitions and general corporate purposes.\nBorrowings under the Loan Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 2.25%. The original scheduled maturity date of April 30, 2020, subject to certain prepayment requirements upon a change of control, was extended in April 2019 to April 30, 2022. In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop requiring banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021. The Company's loan agreements dictate that the LIBOR rate will automatically convert to a rate of interest based on an adjustable index and spread that is reasonably equivalent to the LIBOR rate.\nSimilar to the senior secured notes, the Loan Agreement requires the Company to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated debt service of at least 1.10 to 1.00. The Loan Agreement also contains a provision limiting the payment of dividends if the Company falls below a debt service ratio of 1.25. Additionally, the Loan Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's ability to: create liens and other encumbrances; incur additional indebtedness; merge, liquidate or consolidate with another entity; dispose of or transfer assets; make distributions or other restricted payments (including dividends); engage in certain affiliate transactions; and change the nature of the business. The foregoing covenants are subject to various qualifications and limitations as set forth in the Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the revolving credit facility will be subject to certain customary events of default after which the revolving credit facility may be declared due and payable if not cured within the grace period or, in certain circumstances, may be declared due and payable immediately. Refer to Note 12 - \"Debt\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its financial debt covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this credit line. The Company incurred $40,000 debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2019 and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2018.\nInsurance Coverage\nWe carry various property, casualty, and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles, and exclusions consistent with industry standards. However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. We are self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our short-term and long-term financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\nThe application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates, assumptions, and other judgments. Additionally, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow are impacted by the methods, assumptions, and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. Although our management believes that these estimates, assumptions, and other judgments are appropriate, they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions, and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nEstimation of income taxes includes an evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the Company's ability to utilize the underlying future tax deductions against future taxable income before they expire. The Company's assessment is based upon existing tax laws and estimates of future taxable income. If the assessment of the Company's ability to utilize the underlying future tax deductions changes, the Company would be required to recognize fewer of the tax deductions as assets, which would increase the income tax expense in the period in which the determination is made. Additionally, an evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax gains is based on an assessment of the Company's ability to fully utilize the deferred tax gain before it expires. The Company's assessment is based upon the ability to acquire qualifying properties. If the assessment of the Company's ability to fully utilize the deferred tax gain changes, the Company would be required to recognize income tax expense in the period in which the deferred tax gain expires.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA discussion of recently issued and recently issued but not yet adopted accounting pronouncements is included footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\") Accounting Election and Other Matters\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can elect to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We chose to take advantage of this extended transition provision. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock-Our election to take advantage of the JOBS Act extended accounting transition period may make our financial statements more difficult to

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a water resource management company that owns, operates, and manages water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities in strategically located communities, principally in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. We seek to deploy our integrated approach, which we refer to as \"Total Water Management,\" a term we use to mean managing the entire water cycle by owning and operating the water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities within the same geographic areas in order to both conserve water and maximize its total economic and social value. We use Total Water Management to promote sustainable communities in areas where we expect growth to outpace the existing potable water supply. Our model focuses on the broad issues of water supply and scarcity and applies principles of water conservation through water recycling and leveraging advanced systems. Our basic premise is that the world's water supply is limited and yet can be stretched significantly through effective planning, the use of recycled water, and by providing individuals and communities resources that promote wise water usage practices.\nBusiness Outlook\n2018 and 2019 continued the trend of positive growth in new connections. According to the 2010 U.S. Census Data, the Phoenix metropolitan statistical area ( MSA\u201d) is the 14th largest MSA in the U.S. and had a population of 4.2 million, an increase of 29% over the 3.3 million people reported in the 2000 Census. Metropolitan Phoenix continues to grow due to its low-cost housing, excellent weather, large and growing universities, a diverse employment base, and low taxes. The Employment and Population Statistics Department of the State of Arizona predicts that the Phoenix Metropolitan area will have a population of 5.7 million people by 2030 and 6.5 million by 2040. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, Arizona's employment rate improved by 2.9%, ranking the state in the top two nationally for job growth.\nAlso, according to the W.P. Carey School of Business Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Real Estate Consensus Panel, most sectors of real estate are expected to experience improved growth with industrial and retail sectors also expected to experience improved occupancy rates. For Maricopa County and Pinal County combined, the Homebuilders Association of Central Arizona reported that single family housing permits grew 14% to 25,127 units in 2019.\nThe forecast by the Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Real Estate Consensus Panel for 2020 remains positive at approximately 26,000 single family dwelling permits. From there, we believe growth in the region could steadily return towards its normal historical rate of greater than 30,000 single family dwelling permits.\nWe believe that our utilities and service areas are directly in the anticipated path of growth primarily in the metropolitan Phoenix area. Market data indicates that our service areas currently incorporate a large portion of the final platted lots, partially finished lots, and finished lots in metropolitan Phoenix. Management believes that we are well-positioned to benefit from the near-term growth in metropolitan Phoenix due to the availability of lots and existing infrastructure in place within our services areas.\nFactors Affecting our Results of Operations\nOur financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industry-wide factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022population and community growth;\n\u2022economic and environmental utility regulation;\n\u2022economic environment;\n\u2022the need for infrastructure investment;\n\u2022production and treatment costs;\n\u2022weather and seasonality; and\n\u2022access to and quality of water supply.\nWe are subject to economic regulation by the state regulator, the Arizona Corporation Commission ( ACC\u201d). The U.S. federal and state governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. We continue to execute on our strategy to optimize and focus the Company in order to provide greater value to our customers and shareholders by aiming to deliver predictable financial results, making prudent capital investments, and focusing our efforts on earning an appropriate rate of return on our investments.\nPopulation and Community Growth\nPopulation and community growth in the metropolitan Phoenix area served by our utilities have a direct impact on our earnings. An increase or decrease in our active service connections will affect our revenues and variable expenses in a corresponding manner. Our total service connections, including both active service connections and connections to vacant homes, increased 1,908 connections, or 4.3%, from a total of 44,289 as of December 31, 2018 to 46,197 as of December 31, 2019. This increase is due primarily to the positive growth in new connections.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have 45,823 active service connections compared to 43,687 active service connections as of December 31, 2018, an increase of 2,136, or 4.9%. As with the increase in total service connections, the increase is due primarily to the growth in new connections. Approximately 92.9% of the 45,823 active service connections are serviced by our Global Water - Santa Cruz Water Company, LLC ( Santa Cruz\u201d) and Global Water - Palo Verde Utilities Company, LLC ( Palo Verde\u201d) utilities as of December 31, 2019.\nThe graph below presents the historical change in active and total connections for our ongoing operations, adjusting for the July 2015 condemnation of the assets and operations of Valencia Water Company (\"Valencia\") and the May 2016 sale of Willow Valley.\nEconomic and Environmental Utility Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive regulation of our rates by the ACC, which is charged with establishing rates based on the provision of reliable service at a reasonable cost while also providing an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on rate base for investors of utilities. The ACC uses a historical test year to evaluate whether the plant in service is used and useful, to assess whether costs were prudently incurred, and to set just and reasonable\u201d rates. Rate base is typically the depreciated original cost of the plant in service (net of contributions in aid of construction ( CIAC\u201d) and advances in aid of construction ( AIAC\u201d) which are funds or property provided to a utility under the terms of a main extension agreement, the value of which may be refundable), that has been determined to have been prudently invested\u201d and used and useful\u201d, although the reconstruction cost of the utility plant may also be considered in determining the rate base. The ACC also decides on an applicable capital structure based on actual or hypothetical analyses. The ACC determines a rate of return\u201d on that rate base, which includes the approved capital structure and the actual cost of debt and a fair and reasonable cost of equity based on the ACC's judgment. The overall revenue requirement for rate making purposes is established by multiplying the rate of return by the rate base and adding prudently\u201d incurred operating expenses for the test year, depreciation, and any applicable pro forma adjustments.\nTo ensure an optimal combination of access to water and water conservation balanced with a fair rate of return for investors, our water utility operating revenue is based on two components: a fixed fee and a consumption or volumetric fee. For our water utilities, the fixed fee, or basic service charge,\u201d provides access to water for residential usage and has generally been set at a level to produce 50% of total revenue. The volumetric fee is based on the total volume of water supplied to a given customer after the minimum number of gallons, if any, covered by the basic service charge, multiplied by a price per gallon set by a tariff approved by the ACC. A discount to the volumetric rate applies for customers that use less than an amount specified by the ACC. For all investor-owned water utilities, the ACC requires the establishment of inverted tier conservation oriented rates, meaning that the price of water increases as consumption increases. For wastewater utilities, wastewater collection, and treatment can be based on volumetric or fixed fees. Our wastewater utility services are billed based solely on a fixed fee, determined by the size of the water meter installed. Recycled water is sold on a volumetric basis with no fixed fee component.\nWe are required to file rate cases with the ACC to obtain approval for a change in rates. Rate cases and other rate-related proceedings can take a year or more to complete. As a result, there is frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time of a capital investment or incurrence of an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates. In normal conditions, it would not be uncommon to see us file for a rate increase every three years based on year one being the test year, year two being the rate case filing year, and year three being the rate case award year. However, based on our settlement with the ACC in 2014 and extended new rate phase-in period, we have not initiated the next rate case on this timeline. On March 20, 2019, we filed a motion with the ACC to request an order for certain of our utilities to file a rate case. Thereafter, on April 26, 2019, the ACC issued Decision No. 77168, which requires all of our utilities to file a rate case no later than June 30, 2020, using the twelve months ending December 31, 2019 as the test year for the rate case. Refer to -Rate Case Activity\u201d for additional information.\nOur water and wastewater operations are also subject to extensive United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, and discharge wastewater. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. The ACC also sets conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. We incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulation.\nEnvironmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently, and they have tended to become more stringent over time. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating expenses. We would generally expect to recover expenses associated with compliance for environmental and health and safety standards through rate increases, but this recovery may be affected by regulatory lag.\nEconomic Environment\nThe growth of our customer base depends almost entirely on the success of developers in developing residential and commercial properties within our service areas. Real estate development is a cyclical industry and development in our service areas is contingent upon construction or acquisition of major public improvements, such as arterial streets, drainage facilities, telephone and electrical facilities, recreational facilities, street lighting, and local in-tract improvements (e.g., site grading). Many of these improvements are built by municipalities with public financing, and municipal resources and access to capital may not be sufficient to support development in areas of rapid population growth. For additional information and risks associated with the economic environment, see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nInfrastructure Investment\nCapital expenditures for infrastructure investment are a component of the rate base on which our regulated utility subsidiaries are allowed to earn an equity return. Capital expenditures for infrastructure provide a basis for earnings growth by expanding our used and useful\u201d rate base, which is a component of our permitted return on investment and revenue requirement. We are generally able to recover a rate of return on these capital expenditures (return on equity and debt), together with debt service and certain operating costs, through the rates we charge.\nWe have made significant capital investments in our territories within the last sixteen years, and because the infrastructure remains in the early stages of its useful life, we do not expect comparable capital investments to be required in the near term, either for growth or to maintain the existing infrastructure. Nevertheless, we have an established capital improvement plan to make targeted capital investments to add capacity for growth in new service areas as required, repair and replace existing infrastructure as needed, address operating redundancy requirements, and improve our overall financial performance, by lowering expenses and increasing revenue. Additionally, to reduce our cash tax obligation associated with our deferred tax liability of approximately $19.4 million resulting from the gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, we have substantially completed the planned investments within our capital improvement plan that we determined will qualify under the Internal Revenue Code \u00a71033 re-investment criteria pursuant to a favorable Private Letter Ruling with the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\"). Refer to -Corporate Transactions-Private Letter Ruling\u201d for additional information.\nProduction and Treatment Costs\nOur water and wastewater services require significant production resources and therefore result in significant production costs. Although we are permitted to recover these costs through the rates we charge, regulatory lag can decrease our margins and earnings if production costs or other operating expenses increase significantly before we are able to recover them through increased rates. Our most significant costs include labor, chemicals used to treat water and wastewater, and power used to operate pumps and other equipment. Power and chemical costs can be volatile. However, we employ a variety of technologies and methodologies to minimize costs and maximize operational efficiencies. Additionally, with our Total Water Management approach, whereby we maximize the direct beneficial reuse of recycled water, we can realize significant treatment costs and power savings because smaller volumes of water are required for potable use. Many utilities require that all water be treated to potable standards irrespective of use. Total Water Management focuses on the right water for the right use. Potable water is needed for consumption and recycled water is acceptable for non-potable uses such as irrigation. Non-potable water does not need to be treated for commonly occurring and regulated constituents such as arsenic, or for other current or future human consumption health-based contaminants.\nWeather and Seasonality\nOur ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. Drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. Also, customer usage of water and recycled water is affected by weather conditions, particularly during the summer. Our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for irrigation and other outdoor uses. However, summer weather that is cooler or wetter than average generally suppresses customer water demand and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income. Conversely, when weather conditions are extremely dry, our business may be affected by government-issued drought-related warnings and/or water usage restrictions that would artificially lower customer demand and reduce our operating revenue. For additional information and risks associated with weather and seasonality, see Risk Factors,\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. The limited geographic diversity of our service areas makes the results of our operations more sensitive to the effect of local weather extremes. The second and third quarters of the year are generally those in which water services revenue and wastewater services revenues are highest. Accordingly, interim results should not be considered representative of the results of a full year.\nAccess to and Quality of Water Supply\nIn many areas of Arizona (including certain areas that we service), water supplies are limited and, in some cases, current usage rates exceed sustainable levels for certain water resources. We currently rely predominantly (and are likely to continue to rely) on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water for non-potable uses to meet future demands in our service areas. At present, groundwater (and recycled water derived from groundwater) is the primary water supply available to us. In addition, regulatory restrictions on the use of groundwater and the development of groundwater wells, lack of available water rights, drought, overuse of local or regional sources of water, protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors, including climate change, may limit the availability of ground or surface water. For additional information and risks associated with the access to and quality of water supply, see Risk Factors,\u201d included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nRate Case Activity\nOn July 9, 2012, we filed rate applications with the ACC to adjust the revenue requirements for seven utilities. In August 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the ACC staff, the Residential Utility Consumers Office, the City of Maricopa, and other parties to the rate case. The settlement required approval by the ACC before it could take effect. In February 2014, the rate case proceedings were completed and the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 74364, approving the settlement agreement. The collective rate increase included a 9.5% return on common equity which contributed to a 15% increase over revenue in 2011.\nFor our utilities, adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, the settlement provided for a collective aggregate revenue requirement increase of $3.6 million based on 2011 test year service connections, phased-in over time, with the first increase in January 2015 as follows (in thousands, not updated for the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA\u201d), refer to \"-Corporate Transactions-ACC Tax Docket\" for further details):\n\nWhereas this phase-in of additional revenues was determined using a 2011 test year, to the extent that the number of active service connections has increased and continues to increase from 2011 levels, the additional revenues may be greater than the amounts set forth above. On the other hand, if active connections decrease or we experience declining usage per customer, we may not realize all of the anticipated revenues.\nOn September 20, 2018, the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 76901, which set forth the reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Greater Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities due to the TCJA. Rate Decision No. 76901 adopted the phase-in approach for the reductions to match the phase-in of our revenue requirement under Rate Decision No. 74364. Refer to \"- Corporate Transactions - ACC Tax Docket\" for details regarding Decision No. 76901.\nACC Rate Case\nOn March 20, 2019, we filed a motion with the ACC to request an order for certain of our utilities to file a rate case. Thereafter, on April 26, 2019, the ACC issued Decision No. 77168, which requires all of our utilities to file a rate case no later than June 30, 2020, using the twelve months ending December 31, 2019 as the test year for the rate case. Refer to - Corporate Transactions - ACC Rate Case\u201d for additional information.\nICFA Treatment\nFrom 2003 to 2008, we entered into approximately 154 infrastructure coordination and financing agreements ( ICFAs\u201d) with developers and landowners covering approximately 275 square miles. Under these agreements, we have a contractual obligation to the developers and landowners to ensure that amongst other things, physical capacity exists through our regulated utilities for water and wastewater to the landowner/developer when needed. We receive fees from the landowner/developer for undertaking these obligations that typically are a negotiated amount per planned equivalent dwelling unit for the specified development or parcel of land. Payments are generally due to us from the landowner/developer based on progress of the development, with a portion due upon signing of the agreement, a portion due upon completion of certain milestones and the final payment due upon final plat approval or sale of the subdivision. The payments are non-refundable. Our investment can be considerable, as we may phase-in the construction of facilities in accordance with a regional master plan, as opposed to a single development.\nWith the issuance of Rate Decision No. 74364, in February 2014, the ACC changed how ICFA funds would be characterized and accounted for going forward. Most notably, the ACC changed the rate treatment of ICFA funds, now, ICFA funds already received or which had become due prior to the date of Rate Decision No. 74364 were accounted for in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy that had been in place prior to the 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision, wherein the funds received are recognized as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. Rate Decision No. 74364 prescribes that of the ICFA funds which come due and are paid subsequent to December 31, 2013, 70% of the ICFA funds will be recorded in the associated utility subsidiary as a hook-up fee ( HUF\u201d) liability, with the remaining 30% to be recorded as deferred revenue, until such time that the HUF tariff is fully funded, after which the remaining funds will be recorded as deferred revenue in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy. A HUF tariff, specifying the dollar value of a HUF for each utility, was\napproved by the ACC as part of Rate Decision No. 74364. We are responsible for assuring the full HUF value is paid from ICFA proceeds, and recorded in its full amount by predetermined milestones in Rate Decision No. 74364, even if it results in recording more or less than 30% of the ICFA fee as deferred revenue.\nWe account for the portion of future payments received under these agreements allocated to HUF liability as CIAC. However, from the regulator's perspective, HUFs do not impact rate base until the related funds are expended. These funds are segregated in a separate bank account and used to construct plant assets. The HUF liability is to be relieved once the funds are used for the construction of plant. For facilities required under a hook-up fee or ICFA, we must first use the HUF funds received, after which we may use debt or equity financing for the remainder of construction. The deferred revenue portion of these fees is recognized as revenue once the obligations specified within the applicable ICFA are met, including construction of sufficient operating capacity to serve the customers for which revenue was deferred.\nPursuant to Rate Decision No. 74364, we have agreed not to enter into any new ICFAs, and instead will utilize HUF tariffs, which have become an acceptable industry practice in Arizona. As part of the settlement, a HUF tariff was established for each utility. Existing ICFAs will remain in place, with 70% of future ICFA payments to be recorded as HUFs until the HUF liability is fully funded. The HUF liability is relieved as funds are expended to construct plant, at which time a corresponding amount is recorded to CIAC. The portion of ICFA proceeds not recorded as HUF will be recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy.\nIn addition to ICFAs, we have various line extension agreements with developers and builders, through which funds, water line extensions or wastewater line extensions are provided to us by the developers and are considered refundable advances for construction. These AIACs are subject to refund by us to the developers through annual payments that are computed as a percentage of the total annual gross revenue earned from customers connected to utility services constructed under the agreement over a specified period. Upon the expiration of the agreements' refunding period, the remaining balance of the AIAC becomes nonrefundable and at that time is considered CIAC. CIAC is amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated remaining life of the related utility plant. For rate-making purposes, a utility plant funded by AIAC and CIAC is excluded from rate base. The taxability of AIAC and CIAC was changed with the enactment of the TCJA. Previously, the majority of AIAC and CIAC that we collected were not taxable. However, with the enactment of the TCJA, they will be taxable going forward. On November 27, 2018, the ACC ruled that the utility may require that the contributor pay a gross-up to the utility consisting of 55% of the income tax expense with the utility covering the remaining 45% of the income tax expense. For more details regarding the ruling, refer to \"-Corporate Transactions - ACC Tax Docket.\"\nCorporate Transactions\nStipulated Condemnation of the Operations and Assets of Valencia\nOn July 14, 2015, we closed the stipulated condemnation to transfer the operations and assets of Valencia to the City of Buckeye. Terms of the condemnation were agreed upon through a settlement agreement and stipulated final judgment of condemnation wherein the City of Buckeye acquired all the operations and assets of Valencia and assumed operation of the utility upon close. The City of Buckeye paid the Company $55.0 million at close, plus an additional $0.1 million in working capital adjustments. The City of Buckeye is obligated to pay the Company a growth premium equal to $3,000 for each new water meter installed within Valencia's prior service areas in the City of Buckeye, for a 20-year period ending December 31, 2034, subject to a maximum payout of $45.0 million over the term of the agreement.\nSale of Loop 303 Contracts\nIn September 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell certain wastewater facilities main extension agreements and offsite water management agreements for the contemplated Loop 303 service area, along with their related rights and obligations (which we refer to collectively as the Loop 303 Contracts\u201d), relating to the 7,000-acre territory within a portion of the western planning area of the City of Glendale, Arizona known as the Loop 303 Corridor.\u201d Pursuant to the agreement, we sold the Loop 303 Contracts to EPCOR for total proceeds of approximately $4.1 million which was paid to us over time as certain milestones were met between EPCOR and the developers/landowners of the Loop 303 Corridor. As of December 31, 2018, we had received $3.1 million of the proceeds and in March 2019, we received the final payment of $1.0 million. These proceeds were recorded as other income.\nPrivate Letter Ruling\nOn June 2, 2016, we received a Private Letter Ruling from the IRS that, for purposes of deferring the approximately $19.4 million gain realized from the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, determined that the assets converted upon the condemnation of such assets could be replaced through certain reclamation facility improvements contemplated by the\nCompany under Internal Revenue Code \u00a71033 as property similar or related in service or use. In June 2016, the Company converted all operating subsidiaries from corporations to limited liability companies to take full advantage of the benefits of such ruling.\nPursuant to Internal Revenue Code \u00a71033, we would have been able to defer the gain on condemnation through the end of 2017. Following the Company's subsequent requests for extensions which were approved by the IRS, the Company may now defer the gain through the end of 2020. Accordingly, the Company expects to fully defer the remaining tax liability of approximately $0.1 million as of December 31, 2019 in 2020.\nLine of Credit\nOn April 20, 2018, we entered into an agreement with MidFirst Bank, a federally chartered savings association, for a two-year revolving line of credit up to $8.0 million. The credit facility, which will be used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes, bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%. In April 2019, we signed an amendment to the loan agreement which extends the maturity date from April 30, 2020 to April 30, 2022 and modifies the debt service coverage ratio to match the ratio required by the senior secured notes; all other terms remain unchanged. As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit line.\nAcquisition of Turner Ranches Water and Sanitation Company\nOn May 30, 2018, we acquired Turner Ranches Water and Sanitation Company (\"Turner\"), a non-potable irrigation water utility located in Mesa, Arizona for a purchase price of $2.8 million. At the time of acquisition, Turner had 963 residential irrigation connections and approximately seven square miles of service area. We believe this acquisition is consistent with the Company's declared strategy of making accretive acquisitions.\nACC Tax Docket\nOn December 20, 2017, the ACC opened a docket to address the utility ratemaking implications of the TCJA. The ACC subsequently approved an order in February 2018 requiring Arizona utilities to apply regulatory accounting treatment, which includes the use of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, to address all impacts from the enactment of the TCJA.\nOn September 20, 2018, the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 76901, which set forth the reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Greater Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities due to lower corporate tax rates under the TCJA. Rate Decision No. 76901 adopted a phase-in approach for the reductions to match the phase-in of our revenue requirement under the Rate Decision No. 74364 enacted in February 2014. In 2019, the annual reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Greater Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities were approximately $346,000, $523,000, $16,000, and $5,000, respectively. In 2021, the final year of the phase-in, the annual reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities will be approximately $415,000, $669,000, $16,000, and $5,000, respectively. The ACC also approved a carrying cost of 4.25% on regulatory liabilities resulting from the difference of the fully phased-in rates to be applied in 2021 versus the phased-in rates refunded in 2018.\nRate Decision No. 76901, however, did not address the impacts of the TCJA on accumulated deferred income taxes ( ADIT\u201d), including excess ADIT ( EADIT\u201d). Following the ACC's request for a proposal, the Company made its proposal in filings on December 19, 2018 and July 1, 2019. ACC Staff reviewed the Company's filing and requested that the Company defer tariff revisions until such revisions can be considered in the next rate case. ACC Staff also requested that the Company defer consideration of the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities associated with 2018 EADIT amortization. On July 18, 2019, the Company made a filing proposing these items be deferred to the next rate case. Refer to \" - Corporate Transactions - ACC Rate Case\" for additional information regarding the Company's next rate case.\nOn November 27, 2018, February 20, 2019, February 28, 2019, and January 23, 2020, the ACC adopted orders relating to the funding for income taxes on CIAC and AIAC (which became taxable for our regulated utilities under the TCJA). Those orders 1) require that under the hybrid sharing method, a contributor will pay a gross-up to the utility consisting of 55% of the income tax expense with the utility covering the remaining 45% of the income tax expense; 2) remove the full gross-up method option for Class A and B utilities and their affiliates (which includes all of our utilities); 3) ensure proper ratemaking treatment of a utility using the self-pay method; 4) clarify that pass-through entities that are owned by a C\u201d corporation can recover tax expense according to methods allowed; and 5) require Class A and B utilities to self-pay the taxes associated with hook-up fee contributions but permit using a portion of the hook-up fees to fund these taxes. The Company's utilities have adopted the hybrid sharing method for income tax on CIAC and AIAC.\nACC Rate Case\nOn March 20, 2019, we filed a motion with the ACC to request an order for certain of our utilities to file a rate case. Thereafter, on April 26, 2019, the ACC issued Decision No. 77168, which requires all of our utilities to file a rate case no later than June 30, 2020, using the twelve months ending December 31, 2019 as the test year for the rate case. The outcome of the new rate case cannot be predicted, but we anticipate that new rates would not take effect before the second half of 2021. We are in the initial stages of evaluating and preparing for the rate case, but we anticipate requesting a moderate increase in rates. There is no guarantee, however, that the ACC will approve a rate increase or take any other actions as a result of the rate case, and it is possible that the ACC may determine to decrease future rates.\n2018 Common Stock Offering\nOn July 20, 2018, we completed a public offering of 1,720,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $9.25 per share, for gross proceeds of $15.9 million, which included 220,000 shares issued and sold pursuant to the underwriter's exercise in full of its option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds of approximately $14.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, which collectively totaled $1.3 million.\nAcquisition of Red Rock Utilities\nOn October 16, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Red Rock, an operator of a water and a wastewater utility with service areas in Pima and Pinal counties of Arizona, for a purchase price of $5.9 million. The acquisition added over 1,650 connections and approximately 9 square miles of service area. The Company is obligated to pay to the seller a growth premium equal to $750 for each new account established within three specified growth premium areas, commencing in each area on the date of the first meter installation and ending on the earlier of ten years after such first installation date or twenty years from the acquisition date. The three specified growth premium areas are located in Pima County, Arizona where Red Rock has not yet begun operating, and where Red Rock is authorized to provide water utility services only. As of December 31, 2019, no meters have been installed and no accounts have been established in any of the three growth premium areas. We believe this acquisition is consistent with the Company's declared strategy of making accretive acquisitions.\nRecent Events\n2020 Common Stock Offering\nOn January 21, 2020, we completed a public offering of 870,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price per share of $12.50, for gross proceeds of $10.9 million. On January 30, 2020, we issued an additional 130,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $12.50 per share, for gross proceeds of $1.6 million, resulting in total proceeds from the offering of approximately $12.5 million. The issuance of the additional shares was completed pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriter's over-allotment option. We received net proceeds of approximately $11.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, which collectively totaled $0.9 million.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In consideration of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, we are not organized around specific products and services, geographic regions, or regulatory environments. We currently operate in one geographic region within the State of Arizona, wherein each operating utility operates within the same regulatory environment.\nWhile we report revenue, disaggregated by service type, on the face of our statement of operations, we do not manage the business based on any performance measure at the individual revenue stream level. We do not have any customers that contribute more than 10% to our revenues or revenue streams. Additionally, the chief operating decision maker uses consolidated financial information to evaluate our performance, which is the same basis on which he communicates our results and performance to our board of directors. It is upon this consolidated basis from which he bases all significant decisions regarding the allocation of our resources on a consolidated level. Based on the information described above and in accordance with the applicable literature, management has concluded that we are currently organized and operated as one operating and reportable segment.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\n\nRevenues - The following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\n\nTotal revenues remained consistent at $35.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. In 2018, $2.5 million in infrastructure coordination and financing agreements (ICFA) revenue was recognized, while no ICFA revenue was recognized in 2019. Excluding the ICFA revenue recognized, total revenues increased $2.4 million, or 7.3% for the full year 2019. The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by the Turner and Red Rock acquisitions combined with organic growth in connections.\nWater Services - Water services revenue increased $0.8 million, or 5.2%, to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in water services revenue is primarily due to the acquisitions of Red Rock and Turner coupled with organic growth and rate increases related to Rate Decision 74364.\nWater services revenue based on consumption increased $0.1 million, or 1.5%, to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in consumption revenue is primarily driven by the acquisitions of Turner and Red Rock.\nActive water connections increased 4.8% to 23,770 as of December 31, 2019 from 22,691 as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to growth in new connections.\nWater consumption increased 8.5% to 2.8 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2.6 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in consumption is primarily attributed to the acquisitions of Turner and Red Rock, partially offset by decreases in construction and commercial consumption.\nWater services revenue associated with the basic service charge, excluding miscellaneous charges, increased $0.7 million, or 8.6%, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase resulted from the Turner and Red Rock acquisitions coupled with an increase in organic active service connections, combined with an increase in rates related to Rate Decision No. 74364.\nWastewater and Recycled Water Services - Wastewater and recycled water services revenue increased $1.6 million, or 9.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in wastewater and recycled water services revenue is primarily driven by a $1.6 million increase in wastewater services revenue (inclusive of a $0.7 million increase due to Red Rock). The increase in wastewater services revenue is attributed to the increase in rates related\nto Rate Decision No. 74364, as well as the increase in active wastewater connections, which increased 5.0% to 22,053 as of December 31, 2019 from 20,996 as of December 31, 2018.\nRecycled water services revenue, which is based on the number of gallons delivered, increased $0.1 million, or 14.4%, to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in recycled water services revenue is primarily related to the increase in recycled water rates, partially offset by a decrease in consumption. The volume of recycled water delivered decreased 44 million gallons, or 6.5%, to 639 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 683 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2018. Recycled water rates increased 9.4% per Rate Decision No. 74364 compared to 2018.\nOperating Expenses - The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\n\nOperations and Maintenance - Operations and maintenance costs, consisting of personnel costs, production costs (primarily chemicals and purchased electrical power), maintenance costs, and property tax, increased $0.6 million, or 9.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTotal personnel expenses increased $0.4 million, or 20.4%, to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in personnel expense was primarily driven by the Turner and Red Rock acquisitions, and increases in salary and wages.\nProperty tax expense increased $0.1 million, or 4.5%, to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Property taxes are calculated using a centrally valued property calculation, which derives property values based upon three-year historical average revenues. As revenues increase, we expect property taxes to also increase. The increase is also partially due to the Turner and Red Rock acquisitions.\nOperations and maintenance - related party - Operations and maintenance - related party expense increased $0.1 million, or 4.9%, to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is due to the monthly rate per account owed for FATHOM service fees, which increased to $6.43 on January 1, 2019 from $6.24. The increase was also partially driven by the acquisition of Red Rock coupled with organic connection growth.\nGeneral and Administrative - General and administrative costs include the day-to-day expenses of office operations, personnel costs, legal and other professional fees, insurance, rent, and regulatory fees. These costs increased $0.7 million, or 6.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPersonnel related costs increased $0.4 million, or 12.3%, to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by an increase in salaries and bonuses due to the hiring of additional employees, coupled with an increase in other employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDeferred compensation expense increased $0.2 million, or 14.8%, to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to the higher increase in the carrying value of our equity awards due to the year over year change in our stock price, which increased $3.01 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an increase of $0.80 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was also caused by an increase in employee option expense due to the 2019 stock option grant, the value of which we started expensing in August 2019. Refer to Note 14 - Deferred Compensation Awards\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nProfessional fees decreased $0.2 million, or 8.3%, to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily related to expenses associated with strategic initiatives and TCJA analysis performed during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther Expense - Other expense totaled $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $0.8 million in other expense was primarily driven by the receipt of the final $1.0 million of proceeds in March 2019 relating to the Loop 303 contracts, partially offset by a decrease in the Valencia earn out of $0.2 million. The Valencia earnout consists of $3,000 for each new water meter installed within Valencia's prior service areas.\nOther - related party income increased $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Other - related party income includes royalty income based upon a percentage of certain FATHOM recurring revenue combined with the equity method gains and losses associated with our equity method investment in FATHOM Water Management Holdings, LLP (the \"FATHOM Partnership\"). As previously disclosed, based on the breach of the services agreement and cessation of services by GWM on December 20, 2019, the Company considers the services agreement to be terminated effective on that date. Additionally, the Company will no longer receive such royalty payments for periods after such date. The change in other - related party income was primarily driven by the equity method loss recorded on our investment in the FATHOM Partnership of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 6 - Equity Method Investment\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. The increase in Other - related party income was partially offset by a $63,000 decrease in royalty income for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense - Income tax expense of $1.2 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in pre-tax net income for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Income - Our net income totaled $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net income of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $0.9 million decrease was primarily attributed to ICFA revenue recognized in 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019, offset by Loop 303 proceeds and connection growth in 2019 compared to 2018.\nOutstanding Share Data\nAs of March 2, 2020, there were 22,537,381 shares of our common stock outstanding and options to acquire an additional 632,500 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur capital resources are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as debt and equity financing. Additionally, our regulated utility subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders, and real estate developers to partially fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. We use our capital resources to:\n\u2022fund operating costs;\n\u2022fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures;\n\u2022pay dividends;\n\u2022fund acquisitions;\n\u2022make debt and interest payments; and\n\u2022invest in new and existing ventures.\nOur utility subsidiaries operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited. Such recovery will take place over an extended period of time because recovery through rate increases is subject to regulatory lag.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have no notable near-term cash expenditures or debt obligations. While specific facts and circumstances could change, we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand, and the ability to draw on the $8.0 million available under the Loan Agreement (as defined below), to meet our operating cash flow requirements and capital expenditure plan as well as remain in compliance with our debt covenants for at least the next twelve months.\nIn March 2014, we initiated a dividend program to declare and pay a monthly dividend. On November 6, 2019, we announced a monthly dividend increase from $0.023861 per share ($0.286332 per share annually) to $0.0241 per share ($0.2892 per share annually). Although we expect monthly dividends will be declared and paid for the foreseeable future, the declaration of any dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and is subject to legal requirements and debt service ratio covenant requirements (refer to -Senior Secured Notes\" and \"-Revolving Credit Line\").\nCash from Operating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities are used for operating needs and to meet capital expenditure requirements. Our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by economic utility regulation, infrastructure investment, growth in service connections, customer usage of water, compliance with environmental health and safety standards, production costs, weather, and seasonality.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our net cash provided by operating activities totaled $11.6 million compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $0.3 million increase in cash from operating activities was primarily driven by the increase in other non-current liabilities of $0.9 million in 2019 compared to the $2.1 million decrease in 2018, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $0.9 million, coupled with a decrease in net income of $0.9 million.\nCash from Investing Activities\nOur net cash used in investing activities totaled $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $3.3 million change in cash used in investing activities was driven by a decrease in acquisition expenditures of $8.5 million due to the acquisition of Turner and Red Rock which were completed in 2018, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in capital expenditures primarily related to the deferral on the gain realized from the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia.\nWe continue to invest capital prudently in our existing, core service areas where we are able to deploy our Total Water Management model as service connections grow. This includes any required maintenance capital expenditures and the construction of new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities. Following the most recent Private Letter Ruling extension, we expect to fully defer the remaining tax liability of approximately $0.1 million as of December 31, 2019 in 2020 (refer to -Corporate Transactions-Private Letter Ruling\u201d). Our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.\nCash from Financing Activities\nOur net cash used in financing activities totaled $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a $15.1 million change as compared to the $9.5 million in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018. This change was primarily driven by the $14.6 million in net proceeds received from our public offering of stock in July 2018, combined with an increase in dividends paid of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was also due to a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercise of $0.4 million, offset by an increase of $0.4 million in AIAC payments received for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOn June 24, 2016, we issued two series of senior secured notes with a total principal balance of $115.0 million at a blended interest rate of 4.55%. Series A carries a principal balance of $28.8 million and bears an interest rate of 4.38% over a twelve-year term, with the principal payment due on June 15, 2028. Series B carries a principal balance of $86.3 million and bears an interest rate of 4.58% over a 20-year term. Series B is interest only for the first five years, with $1.9 million principal payments paid semiannually thereafter. The proceeds of the senior secured notes were primarily used to refinance our long-term tax exempt bonds, pursuant to an early redemption option at 103%, plus accrued interest, as a result of the initial public offering of our common stock in May 2016.\nThe senior secured notes require the Company to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated debt service of at least 1.10 to 1.00. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated as net income plus depreciation, taxes, interest and other non-cash charges net of non-cash income. Consolidated debt service is calculated as interest expense, principal payments, and dividend or stock repurchases. The senior secured notes also contain a provision limiting the payment of dividends if the Company falls below a debt service ratio of 1.25. However, for the quarter ending June 30, 2021 through the quarter ending March 31, 2024, the ratio drops to 1.20. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its financial debt covenants.\nDebt issuance costs as of both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were $0.6 million.\nRevolving Credit Line\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into a loan agreement (\"Loan Agreement\") with MidFirst Bank, a federally chartered savings association, on the terms and subject to conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement, for a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of $8.0 million. The Company intends to use the borrowings for future acquisitions and general corporate purposes.\nBorrowings under the Loan Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 2.25%. The original scheduled maturity date of April 30, 2020, subject to certain prepayment requirements upon a change of control, was extended in April 2019 to April 30, 2022. In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop requiring banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021. The Company's loan agreements dictate that the LIBOR rate will automatically convert to a rate of interest based on an adjustable index and spread that is reasonably equivalent to the LIBOR rate.\nSimilar to the senior secured notes, the Loan Agreement requires the Company to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated debt service of at least 1.10 to 1.00. The Loan Agreement also contains a provision limiting the payment of dividends if the Company falls below a debt service ratio of 1.25. Additionally, the Loan Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's ability to: create liens and other encumbrances; incur additional indebtedness; merge, liquidate or consolidate with another entity; dispose of or transfer assets; make distributions or other restricted payments (including dividends); engage in certain affiliate transactions; and change the nature of the business. The foregoing covenants are subject to various qualifications and limitations as set forth in the Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the revolving credit facility will be subject to certain customary events of default after which the revolving credit facility may be declared due and payable if not cured within the grace period or, in certain circumstances, may be declared due and payable immediately. Refer to Note 12 - \"Debt\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its financial debt covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this credit line. The Company incurred $40,000 debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2019 and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2018.\nInsurance Coverage\nWe carry various property, casualty, and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles, and exclusions consistent with industry standards. However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. We are self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our short-term and long-term financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\nThe application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates, assumptions, and other judgments. Additionally, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow are impacted by the methods, assumptions, and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. Although our management believes that these estimates, assumptions, and other judgments are appropriate, they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions, and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nEstimation of income taxes includes an evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the Company's ability to utilize the underlying future tax deductions against future taxable income before they expire. The Company's assessment is based upon existing tax laws and estimates of future taxable income. If the assessment of the Company's ability to utilize the underlying future tax deductions changes, the Company would be required to recognize fewer of the tax deductions as assets, which would increase the income tax expense in the period in which the determination is made. Additionally, an evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax gains is based on an assessment of the Company's ability to fully utilize the deferred tax gain before it expires. The Company's assessment is based upon the ability to acquire qualifying properties. If the assessment of the Company's ability to fully utilize the deferred tax gain changes, the Company would be required to recognize income tax expense in the period in which the deferred tax gain expires.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA discussion of recently issued and recently issued but not yet", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a water resource management company that owns, operates, and manages water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities in strategically located communities, principally in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. We seek to deploy our integrated approach, which we refer to as \"Total Water Management,\" a term we use to mean managing the entire water cycle by owning and operating the water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities within the same geographic areas in order to both conserve water and maximize its total economic and social value. We use Total Water Management to promote sustainable communities in areas where we expect growth to outpace the existing potable water supply. Our model focuses on the broad issues of water supply and scarcity and applies principles of water conservation through water recycling and leveraging advanced systems. Our basic premise is that the world's water supply is limited and yet can be stretched significantly through effective planning, the use of recycled water, and by providing individuals and communities resources that promote wise water usage practices.\nBusiness Outlook\n2018 and 2019 continued the trend of positive growth in new connections. According to the 2010 U.S. Census Data, the Phoenix metropolitan statistical area ( MSA\u201d) is the 14th largest MSA in the U.S. and had a population of 4.2 million, an increase of 29% over the 3.3 million people reported in the 2000 Census. Metropolitan Phoenix continues to grow due to its low-cost housing, excellent weather, large and growing universities, a diverse employment base, and low taxes. The Employment and Population Statistics Department of the State of Arizona predicts that the Phoenix Metropolitan area will have a population of 5.7 million people by 2030 and 6.5 million by 2040. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, Arizona's employment rate improved by 2.9%, ranking the state in the top two nationally for job growth.\nAlso, according to the W.P. Carey School of Business Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Real Estate Consensus Panel, most sectors of real estate are expected to experience improved growth with industrial and retail sectors also expected to experience improved occupancy rates. For Maricopa County and Pinal County combined, the Homebuilders Association of Central Arizona reported that single family housing permits grew 14% to 25,127 units in 2019.\nThe forecast by the Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Real Estate Consensus Panel for 2020 remains positive at approximately 26,000 single family dwelling permits. From there, we believe growth in the region could steadily return towards its normal historical rate of greater than 30,000 single family dwelling permits.\nWe believe that our utilities and service areas are directly in the anticipated path of growth primarily in the metropolitan Phoenix area. Market data indicates that our service areas currently incorporate a large portion of the final platted lots, partially finished lots, and finished lots in metropolitan Phoenix. Management believes that we are well-positioned to benefit from the near-term growth in metropolitan Phoenix due to the availability of lots and existing infrastructure in place within our services areas.\nFactors Affecting our Results of Operations\nOur financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industry-wide factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022population and community growth;\n\u2022economic and environmental utility regulation;\n\u2022economic environment;\n\u2022the need for infrastructure investment;\n\u2022production and treatment costs;\n\u2022weather and seasonality; and\n\u2022access to and quality of water supply.\nWe are subject to economic regulation by the state regulator, the Arizona Corporation Commission ( ACC\u201d). The U.S. federal and state governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. We continue to execute on our strategy to optimize and focus the Company in order to provide greater value to our customers and shareholders by aiming to deliver predictable financial results, making prudent capital investments, and focusing our efforts on earning an appropriate rate of return on our investments.\nPopulation and Community Growth\nPopulation and community growth in the metropolitan Phoenix area served by our utilities have a direct impact on our earnings. An increase or decrease in our active service connections will affect our revenues and variable expenses in a corresponding manner. Our total service connections, including both active service connections and connections to vacant homes, increased 1,908 connections, or 4.3%, from a total of 44,289 as of December 31, 2018 to 46,197 as of December 31, 2019. This increase is due primarily to the positive growth in new connections.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have 45,823 active service connections compared to 43,687 active service connections as of December 31, 2018, an increase of 2,136, or 4.9%. As with the increase in total service connections, the increase is due primarily to the growth in new connections. Approximately 92.9% of the 45,823 active service connections are serviced by our Global Water - Santa Cruz Water Company, LLC ( Santa Cruz\u201d) and Global Water - Palo Verde Utilities Company, LLC ( Palo Verde\u201d) utilities as of December 31, 2019.\nThe graph below presents the historical change in active and total connections for our ongoing operations, adjusting for the July 2015 condemnation of the assets and operations of Valencia Water Company (\"Valencia\") and the May 2016 sale of Willow Valley.\nEconomic and Environmental Utility Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive regulation of our rates by the ACC, which is charged with establishing rates based on the provision of reliable service at a reasonable cost while also providing an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on rate base for investors of utilities. The ACC uses a historical test year to evaluate whether the plant in service is used and useful, to assess whether costs were prudently incurred, and to set just and reasonable\u201d rates. Rate base is typically the depreciated original cost of the plant in service (net of contributions in aid of construction ( CIAC\u201d) and advances in aid of construction ( AIAC\u201d) which are funds or property provided to a utility under the terms of a main extension agreement, the value of which may be refundable), that has been determined to have been prudently invested\u201d and used and useful\u201d, although the reconstruction cost of the utility plant may also be considered in determining the rate base. The ACC also decides on an applicable capital structure based on actual or hypothetical analyses. The ACC determines a rate of return\u201d on that rate base, which includes the approved capital structure and the actual cost of debt and a fair and reasonable cost of equity based on the ACC's judgment. The overall revenue requirement for rate making purposes is established by multiplying the rate of return by the rate base and adding prudently\u201d incurred operating expenses for the test year, depreciation, and any applicable pro forma adjustments.\nTo ensure an optimal combination of access to water and water conservation balanced with a fair rate of return for investors, our water utility operating revenue is based on two components: a fixed fee and a consumption or volumetric fee. For our water utilities, the fixed fee, or basic service charge,\u201d provides access to water for residential usage and has generally been set at a level to produce 50% of total revenue. The volumetric fee is based on the total volume of water supplied to a given customer after the minimum number of gallons, if any, covered by the basic service charge, multiplied by a price per gallon set by a tariff approved by the ACC. A discount to the volumetric rate applies for customers that use less than an amount specified by the ACC. For all investor-owned water utilities, the ACC requires the establishment of inverted tier conservation oriented rates, meaning that the price of water increases as consumption increases. For wastewater utilities, wastewater collection, and treatment can be based on volumetric or fixed fees. Our wastewater utility services are billed based solely on a fixed fee, determined by the size of the water meter installed. Recycled water is sold on a volumetric basis with no fixed fee component.\nWe are required to file rate cases with the ACC to obtain approval for a change in rates. Rate cases and other rate-related proceedings can take a year or more to complete. As a result, there is frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time of a capital investment or incurrence of an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates. In normal conditions, it would not be uncommon to see us file for a rate increase every three years based on year one being the test year, year two being the rate case filing year, and year three being the rate case award year. However, based on our settlement with the ACC in 2014 and extended new rate phase-in period, we have not initiated the next rate case on this timeline. On March 20, 2019, we filed a motion with the ACC to request an order for certain of our utilities to file a rate case. Thereafter, on April 26, 2019, the ACC issued Decision No. 77168, which requires all of our utilities to file a rate case no later than June 30, 2020, using the twelve months ending December 31, 2019 as the test year for the rate case. Refer to -Rate Case Activity\u201d for additional information.\nOur water and wastewater operations are also subject to extensive United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, and discharge wastewater. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. The ACC also sets conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. We incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulation.\nEnvironmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently, and they have tended to become more stringent over time. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating expenses. We would generally expect to recover expenses associated with compliance for environmental and health and safety standards through rate increases, but this recovery may be affected by regulatory lag.\nEconomic Environment\nThe growth of our customer base depends almost entirely on the success of developers in developing residential and commercial properties within our service areas. Real estate development is a cyclical industry and development in our service areas is contingent upon construction or acquisition of major public improvements, such as arterial streets, drainage facilities, telephone and electrical facilities, recreational facilities, street lighting, and local in-tract improvements (e.g., site grading). Many of these improvements are built by municipalities with public financing, and municipal resources and access to capital may not be sufficient to support development in areas of rapid population growth. For additional information and risks associated with the economic environment, see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nInfrastructure Investment\nCapital expenditures for infrastructure investment are a component of the rate base on which our regulated utility subsidiaries are allowed to earn an equity return. Capital expenditures for infrastructure provide a basis for earnings growth by expanding our used and useful\u201d rate base, which is a component of our permitted return on investment and revenue requirement. We are generally able to recover a rate of return on these capital expenditures (return on equity and debt), together with debt service and certain operating costs, through the rates we charge.\nWe have made significant capital investments in our territories within the last sixteen years, and because the infrastructure remains in the early stages of its useful life, we do not expect comparable capital investments to be required in the near term, either for growth or to maintain the existing infrastructure. Nevertheless, we have an established capital improvement plan to make targeted capital investments to add capacity for growth in new service areas as required, repair and replace existing infrastructure as needed, address operating redundancy requirements, and improve our overall financial performance, by lowering expenses and increasing revenue. Additionally, to reduce our cash tax obligation associated with our deferred tax liability of approximately $19.4 million resulting from the gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, we have substantially completed the planned investments within our capital improvement plan that we determined will qualify under the Internal Revenue Code \u00a71033 re-investment criteria pursuant to a favorable Private Letter Ruling with the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\"). Refer to -Corporate Transactions-Private Letter Ruling\u201d for additional information.\nProduction and Treatment Costs\nOur water and wastewater services require significant production resources and therefore result in significant production costs. Although we are permitted to recover these costs through the rates we charge, regulatory lag can decrease our margins and earnings if production costs or other operating expenses increase significantly before we are able to recover them through increased rates. Our most significant costs include labor, chemicals used to treat water and wastewater, and power used to operate pumps and other equipment. Power and chemical costs can be volatile. However, we employ a variety of technologies and methodologies to minimize costs and maximize operational efficiencies. Additionally, with our Total Water Management approach, whereby we maximize the direct beneficial reuse of recycled water, we can realize significant treatment costs and power savings because smaller volumes of water are required for potable use. Many utilities require that all water be treated to potable standards irrespective of use. Total Water Management focuses on the right water for the right use. Potable water is needed for consumption and recycled water is acceptable for non-potable uses such as irrigation. Non-potable water does not need to be treated for commonly occurring and regulated constituents such as arsenic, or for other current or future human consumption health-based contaminants.\nWeather and Seasonality\nOur ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. Drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. Also, customer usage of water and recycled water is affected by weather conditions, particularly during the summer. Our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for irrigation and other outdoor uses. However, summer weather that is cooler or wetter than average generally suppresses customer water demand and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income. Conversely, when weather conditions are extremely dry, our business may be affected by government-issued drought-related warnings and/or water usage restrictions that would artificially lower customer demand and reduce our operating revenue. For additional information and risks associated with weather and seasonality, see Risk Factors,\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. The limited geographic diversity of our service areas makes the results of our operations more sensitive to the effect of local weather extremes. The second and third quarters of the year are generally those in which water services revenue and wastewater services revenues are highest. Accordingly, interim results should not be considered representative of the results of a full year.\nAccess to and Quality of Water Supply\nIn many areas of Arizona (including certain areas that we service), water supplies are limited and, in some cases, current usage rates exceed sustainable levels for certain water resources. We currently rely predominantly (and are likely to continue to rely) on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water for non-potable uses to meet future demands in our service areas. At present, groundwater (and recycled water derived from groundwater) is the primary water supply available to us. In addition, regulatory restrictions on the use of groundwater and the development of groundwater wells, lack of available water rights, drought, overuse of local or regional sources of water, protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors, including climate change, may limit the availability of ground or surface water. For additional information and risks associated with the access to and quality of water supply, see Risk Factors,\u201d included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nRate Case Activity\nOn July 9, 2012, we filed rate applications with the ACC to adjust the revenue requirements for seven utilities. In August 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the ACC staff, the Residential Utility Consumers Office, the City of Maricopa, and other parties to the rate case. The settlement required approval by the ACC before it could take effect. In February 2014, the rate case proceedings were completed and the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 74364, approving the settlement agreement. The collective rate increase included a 9.5% return on common equity which contributed to a 15% increase over revenue in 2011.\nFor our utilities, adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, the settlement provided for a collective aggregate revenue requirement increase of $3.6 million based on 2011 test year service connections, phased-in over time, with the first increase in January 2015 as follows (in thousands, not updated for the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA\u201d), refer to \"-Corporate Transactions-ACC Tax Docket\" for further details):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Incremental </td> <td> </td> <td>Cumulative </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,083 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 </td> <td>887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,970 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,305 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,640 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,975 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,645 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhereas this phase-in of additional revenues was determined using a 2011 test year, to the extent that the number of active service connections has increased and continues to increase from 2011 levels, the additional revenues may be greater than the amounts set forth above. On the other hand, if active connections decrease or we experience declining usage per customer, we may not realize all of the anticipated revenues.\nOn September 20, 2018, the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 76901, which set forth the reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Greater Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities due to the TCJA. Rate Decision No. 76901 adopted the phase-in approach for the reductions to match the phase-in of our revenue requirement under Rate Decision No. 74364. Refer to \"- Corporate Transactions - ACC Tax Docket\" for details regarding Decision No. 76901.\nACC Rate Case\nOn March 20, 2019, we filed a motion with the ACC to request an order for certain of our utilities to file a rate case. Thereafter, on April 26, 2019, the ACC issued Decision No. 77168, which requires all of our utilities to file a rate case no later than June 30, 2020, using the twelve months ending December 31, 2019 as the test year for the rate case. Refer to - Corporate Transactions - ACC Rate Case\u201d for additional information.\nICFA Treatment\nFrom 2003 to 2008, we entered into approximately 154 infrastructure coordination and financing agreements ( ICFAs\u201d) with developers and landowners covering approximately 275 square miles. Under these agreements, we have a contractual obligation to the developers and landowners to ensure that amongst other things, physical capacity exists through our regulated utilities for water and wastewater to the landowner/developer when needed. We receive fees from the landowner/developer for undertaking these obligations that typically are a negotiated amount per planned equivalent dwelling unit for the specified development or parcel of land. Payments are generally due to us from the landowner/developer based on progress of the development, with a portion due upon signing of the agreement, a portion due upon completion of certain milestones and the final payment due upon final plat approval or sale of the subdivision. The payments are non-refundable. Our investment can be considerable, as we may phase-in the construction of facilities in accordance with a regional master plan, as opposed to a single development.\nWith the issuance of Rate Decision No. 74364, in February 2014, the ACC changed how ICFA funds would be characterized and accounted for going forward. Most notably, the ACC changed the rate treatment of ICFA funds, now, ICFA funds already received or which had become due prior to the date of Rate Decision No. 74364 were accounted for in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy that had been in place prior to the 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision, wherein the funds received are recognized as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. Rate Decision No. 74364 prescribes that of the ICFA funds which come due and are paid subsequent to December 31, 2013, 70% of the ICFA funds will be recorded in the associated utility subsidiary as a hook-up fee ( HUF\u201d) liability, with the remaining 30% to be recorded as deferred revenue, until such time that the HUF tariff is fully funded, after which the remaining funds will be recorded as deferred revenue in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy. A HUF tariff, specifying the dollar value of a HUF for each utility, was\napproved by the ACC as part of Rate Decision No. 74364. We are responsible for assuring the full HUF value is paid from ICFA proceeds, and recorded in its full amount by predetermined milestones in Rate Decision No. 74364, even if it results in recording more or less than 30% of the ICFA fee as deferred revenue.\nWe account for the portion of future payments received under these agreements allocated to HUF liability as CIAC. However, from the regulator's perspective, HUFs do not impact rate base until the related funds are expended. These funds are segregated in a separate bank account and used to construct plant assets. The HUF liability is to be relieved once the funds are used for the construction of plant. For facilities required under a hook-up fee or ICFA, we must first use the HUF funds received, after which we may use debt or equity financing for the remainder of construction. The deferred revenue portion of these fees is recognized as revenue once the obligations specified within the applicable ICFA are met, including construction of sufficient operating capacity to serve the customers for which revenue was deferred.\nPursuant to Rate Decision No. 74364, we have agreed not to enter into any new ICFAs, and instead will utilize HUF tariffs, which have become an acceptable industry practice in Arizona. As part of the settlement, a HUF tariff was established for each utility. Existing ICFAs will remain in place, with 70% of future ICFA payments to be recorded as HUFs until the HUF liability is fully funded. The HUF liability is relieved as funds are expended to construct plant, at which time a corresponding amount is recorded to CIAC. The portion of ICFA proceeds not recorded as HUF will be recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy.\nIn addition to ICFAs, we have various line extension agreements with developers and builders, through which funds, water line extensions or wastewater line extensions are provided to us by the developers and are considered refundable advances for construction. These AIACs are subject to refund by us to the developers through annual payments that are computed as a percentage of the total annual gross revenue earned from customers connected to utility services constructed under the agreement over a specified period. Upon the expiration of the agreements' refunding period, the remaining balance of the AIAC becomes nonrefundable and at that time is considered CIAC. CIAC is amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated remaining life of the related utility plant. For rate-making purposes, a utility plant funded by AIAC and CIAC is excluded from rate base. The taxability of AIAC and CIAC was changed with the enactment of the TCJA. Previously, the majority of AIAC and CIAC that we collected were not taxable. However, with the enactment of the TCJA, they will be taxable going forward. On November 27, 2018, the ACC ruled that the utility may require that the contributor pay a gross-up to the utility consisting of 55% of the income tax expense with the utility covering the remaining 45% of the income tax expense. For more details regarding the ruling, refer to \"-Corporate Transactions - ACC Tax Docket.\"\nCorporate Transactions\nStipulated Condemnation of the Operations and Assets of Valencia\nOn July 14, 2015, we closed the stipulated condemnation to transfer the operations and assets of Valencia to the City of Buckeye. Terms of the condemnation were agreed upon through a settlement agreement and stipulated final judgment of condemnation wherein the City of Buckeye acquired all the operations and assets of Valencia and assumed operation of the utility upon close. The City of Buckeye paid the Company $55.0 million at close, plus an additional $0.1 million in working capital adjustments. The City of Buckeye is obligated to pay the Company a growth premium equal to $3,000 for each new water meter installed within Valencia's prior service areas in the City of Buckeye, for a 20-year period ending December 31, 2034, subject to a maximum payout of $45.0 million over the term of the agreement.\nSale of Loop 303 Contracts\nIn September 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell certain wastewater facilities main extension agreements and offsite water management agreements for the contemplated Loop 303 service area, along with their related rights and obligations (which we refer to collectively as the Loop 303 Contracts\u201d), relating to the 7,000-acre territory within a portion of the western planning area of the City of Glendale, Arizona known as the Loop 303 Corridor.\u201d Pursuant to the agreement, we sold the Loop 303 Contracts to EPCOR for total proceeds of approximately $4.1 million which was paid to us over time as certain milestones were met between EPCOR and the developers/landowners of the Loop 303 Corridor. As of December 31, 2018, we had received $3.1 million of the proceeds and in March 2019, we received the final payment of $1.0 million. These proceeds were recorded as other income.\nPrivate Letter Ruling\nOn June 2, 2016, we received a Private Letter Ruling from the IRS that, for purposes of deferring the approximately $19.4 million gain realized from the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, determined that the assets converted upon the condemnation of such assets could be replaced through certain reclamation facility improvements contemplated by the\nCompany under Internal Revenue Code \u00a71033 as property similar or related in service or use. In June 2016, the Company converted all operating subsidiaries from corporations to limited liability companies to take full advantage of the benefits of such ruling.\nPursuant to Internal Revenue Code \u00a71033, we would have been able to defer the gain on condemnation through the end of 2017. Following the Company's subsequent requests for extensions which were approved by the IRS, the Company may now defer the gain through the end of 2020. Accordingly, the Company expects to fully defer the remaining tax liability of approximately $0.1 million as of December 31, 2019 in 2020.\nLine of Credit\nOn April 20, 2018, we entered into an agreement with MidFirst Bank, a federally chartered savings association, for a two-year revolving line of credit up to $8.0 million. The credit facility, which will be used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes, bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%. In April 2019, we signed an amendment to the loan agreement which extends the maturity date from April 30, 2020 to April 30, 2022 and modifies the debt service coverage ratio to match the ratio required by the senior secured notes; all other terms remain unchanged. As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit line.\nAcquisition of Turner Ranches Water and Sanitation Company\nOn May 30, 2018, we acquired Turner Ranches Water and Sanitation Company (\"Turner\"), a non-potable irrigation water utility located in Mesa, Arizona for a purchase price of $2.8 million. At the time of acquisition, Turner had 963 residential irrigation connections and approximately seven square miles of service area. We believe this acquisition is consistent with the Company's declared strategy of making accretive acquisitions.\nACC Tax Docket\nOn December 20, 2017, the ACC opened a docket to address the utility ratemaking implications of the TCJA. The ACC subsequently approved an order in February 2018 requiring Arizona utilities to apply regulatory accounting treatment, which includes the use of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, to address all impacts from the enactment of the TCJA.\nOn September 20, 2018, the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 76901, which set forth the reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Greater Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities due to lower corporate tax rates under the TCJA. Rate Decision No. 76901 adopted a phase-in approach for the reductions to match the phase-in of our revenue requirement under the Rate Decision No. 74364 enacted in February 2014. In 2019, the annual reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Greater Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities were approximately $346,000, $523,000, $16,000, and $5,000, respectively. In 2021, the final year of the phase-in, the annual reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities will be approximately $415,000, $669,000, $16,000, and $5,000, respectively. The ACC also approved a carrying cost of 4.25% on regulatory liabilities resulting from the difference of the fully phased-in rates to be applied in 2021 versus the phased-in rates refunded in 2018.\nRate Decision No. 76901, however, did not address the impacts of the TCJA on accumulated deferred income taxes ( ADIT\u201d), including excess ADIT ( EADIT\u201d). Following the ACC's request for a proposal, the Company made its proposal in filings on December 19, 2018 and July 1, 2019. ACC Staff reviewed the Company's filing and requested that the Company defer tariff revisions until such revisions can be considered in the next rate case. ACC Staff also requested that the Company defer consideration of the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities associated with 2018 EADIT amortization. On July 18, 2019, the Company made a filing proposing these items be deferred to the next rate case. Refer to \" - Corporate Transactions - ACC Rate Case\" for additional information regarding the Company's next rate case.\nOn November 27, 2018, February 20, 2019, February 28, 2019, and January 23, 2020, the ACC adopted orders relating to the funding for income taxes on CIAC and AIAC (which became taxable for our regulated utilities under the TCJA). Those orders 1) require that under the hybrid sharing method, a contributor will pay a gross-up to the utility consisting of 55% of the income tax expense with the utility covering the remaining 45% of the income tax expense; 2) remove the full gross-up method option for Class A and B utilities and their affiliates (which includes all of our utilities); 3) ensure proper ratemaking treatment of a utility using the self-pay method; 4) clarify that pass-through entities that are owned by a C\u201d corporation can recover tax expense according to methods allowed; and 5) require Class A and B utilities to self-pay the taxes associated with hook-up fee contributions but permit using a portion of the hook-up fees to fund these taxes. The Company's utilities have adopted the hybrid sharing method for income tax on CIAC and AIAC.\nACC Rate Case\nOn March 20, 2019, we filed a motion with the ACC to request an order for certain of our utilities to file a rate case. Thereafter, on April 26, 2019, the ACC issued Decision No. 77168, which requires all of our utilities to file a rate case no later than June 30, 2020, using the twelve months ending December 31, 2019 as the test year for the rate case. The outcome of the new rate case cannot be predicted, but we anticipate that new rates would not take effect before the second half of 2021. We are in the initial stages of evaluating and preparing for the rate case, but we anticipate requesting a moderate increase in rates. There is no guarantee, however, that the ACC will approve a rate increase or take any other actions as a result of the rate case, and it is possible that the ACC may determine to decrease future rates.\n2018 Common Stock Offering\nOn July 20, 2018, we completed a public offering of 1,720,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $9.25 per share, for gross proceeds of $15.9 million, which included 220,000 shares issued and sold pursuant to the underwriter's exercise in full of its option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds of approximately $14.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, which collectively totaled $1.3 million.\nAcquisition of Red Rock Utilities\nOn October 16, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Red Rock, an operator of a water and a wastewater utility with service areas in Pima and Pinal counties of Arizona, for a purchase price of $5.9 million. The acquisition added over 1,650 connections and approximately 9 square miles of service area. The Company is obligated to pay to the seller a growth premium equal to $750 for each new account established within three specified growth premium areas, commencing in each area on the date of the first meter installation and ending on the earlier of ten years after such first installation date or twenty years from the acquisition date. The three specified growth premium areas are located in Pima County, Arizona where Red Rock has not yet begun operating, and where Red Rock is authorized to provide water utility services only. As of December 31, 2019, no meters have been installed and no accounts have been established in any of the three growth premium areas. We believe this acquisition is consistent with the Company's declared strategy of making accretive acquisitions.\nRecent Events\n2020 Common Stock Offering\nOn January 21, 2020, we completed a public offering of 870,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price per share of $12.50, for gross proceeds of $10.9 million. On January 30, 2020, we issued an additional 130,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $12.50 per share, for gross proceeds of $1.6 million, resulting in total proceeds from the offering of approximately $12.5 million. The issuance of the additional shares was completed pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriter's over-allotment option. We received net proceeds of approximately $11.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, which collectively totaled $0.9 million.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In consideration of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, we are not organized around specific products and services, geographic regions, or regulatory environments. We currently operate in one geographic region within the State of Arizona, wherein each operating utility operates within the same regulatory environment.\nWhile we report revenue, disaggregated by service type, on the face of our statement of operations, we do not manage the business based on any performance measure at the individual revenue stream level. We do not have any customers that contribute more than 10% to our revenues or revenue streams. Additionally, the chief operating decision maker uses consolidated financial information to evaluate our performance, which is the same basis on which he communicates our results and performance to our board of directors. It is upon this consolidated basis from which he bases all significant decisions regarding the allocation of our resources on a consolidated level. Based on the information described above and in accordance with the applicable literature, management has concluded that we are currently organized and operated as one operating and reportable segment.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses </td> <td>28,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>6,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense </td> <td>(3,575) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,384) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes </td> <td>3,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>(1,162) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,782) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic earnings per common share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues - The following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water services </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wastewater and recycled water services </td> <td>19,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unregulated revenues </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,517 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues remained consistent at $35.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. In 2018, $2.5 million in infrastructure coordination and financing agreements (ICFA) revenue was recognized, while no ICFA revenue was recognized in 2019. Excluding the ICFA revenue recognized, total revenues increased $2.4 million, or 7.3% for the full year 2019. The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by the Turner and Red Rock acquisitions combined with organic growth in connections.\nWater Services - Water services revenue increased $0.8 million, or 5.2%, to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in water services revenue is primarily due to the acquisitions of Red Rock and Turner coupled with organic growth and rate increases related to Rate Decision 74364.\nWater services revenue based on consumption increased $0.1 million, or 1.5%, to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in consumption revenue is primarily driven by the acquisitions of Turner and Red Rock.\nActive water connections increased 4.8% to 23,770 as of December 31, 2019 from 22,691 as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to growth in new connections.\nWater consumption increased 8.5% to 2.8 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2.6 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in consumption is primarily attributed to the acquisitions of Turner and Red Rock, partially offset by decreases in construction and commercial consumption.\nWater services revenue associated with the basic service charge, excluding miscellaneous charges, increased $0.7 million, or 8.6%, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase resulted from the Turner and Red Rock acquisitions coupled with an increase in organic active service connections, combined with an increase in rates related to Rate Decision No. 74364.\nWastewater and Recycled Water Services - Wastewater and recycled water services revenue increased $1.6 million, or 9.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in wastewater and recycled water services revenue is primarily driven by a $1.6 million increase in wastewater services revenue (inclusive of a $0.7 million increase due to Red Rock). The increase in wastewater services revenue is attributed to the increase in rates related\nto Rate Decision No. 74364, as well as the increase in active wastewater connections, which increased 5.0% to 22,053 as of December 31, 2019 from 20,996 as of December 31, 2018.\nRecycled water services revenue, which is based on the number of gallons delivered, increased $0.1 million, or 14.4%, to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in recycled water services revenue is primarily related to the increase in recycled water rates, partially offset by a decrease in consumption. The volume of recycled water delivered decreased 44 million gallons, or 6.5%, to 639 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 683 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2018. Recycled water rates increased 9.4% per Rate Decision No. 74364 compared to 2018.\nOperating Expenses - The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operations and maintenance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operations and maintenance - related party </td> <td>1,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>11,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation </td> <td>8,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperations and Maintenance - Operations and maintenance costs, consisting of personnel costs, production costs (primarily chemicals and purchased electrical power), maintenance costs, and property tax, increased $0.6 million, or 9.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTotal personnel expenses increased $0.4 million, or 20.4%, to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in personnel expense was primarily driven by the Turner and Red Rock acquisitions, and increases in salary and wages.\nProperty tax expense increased $0.1 million, or 4.5%, to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Property taxes are calculated using a centrally valued property calculation, which derives property values based upon three-year historical average revenues. As revenues increase, we expect property taxes to also increase. The increase is also partially due to the Turner and Red Rock acquisitions.\nOperations and maintenance - related party - Operations and maintenance - related party expense increased $0.1 million, or 4.9%, to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is due to the monthly rate per account owed for FATHOM service fees, which increased to $6.43 on January 1, 2019 from $6.24. The increase was also partially driven by the acquisition of Red Rock coupled with organic connection growth.\nGeneral and Administrative - General and administrative costs include the day-to-day expenses of office operations, personnel costs, legal and other professional fees, insurance, rent, and regulatory fees. These costs increased $0.7 million, or 6.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPersonnel related costs increased $0.4 million, or 12.3%, to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by an increase in salaries and bonuses due to the hiring of additional employees, coupled with an increase in other employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDeferred compensation expense increased $0.2 million, or 14.8%, to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to the higher increase in the carrying value of our equity awards due to the year over year change in our stock price, which increased $3.01 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an increase of $0.80 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was also caused by an increase in employee option expense due to the 2019 stock option grant, the value of which we started expensing in August 2019. Refer to Note 14 - Deferred Compensation Awards\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nProfessional fees decreased $0.2 million, or 8.3%, to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily related to expenses associated with strategic initiatives and TCJA analysis performed during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther Expense - Other expense totaled $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $0.8 million in other expense was primarily driven by the receipt of the final $1.0 million of proceeds in March 2019 relating to the Loop 303 contracts, partially offset by a decrease in the Valencia earn out of $0.2 million. The Valencia earnout consists of $3,000 for each new water meter installed within Valencia's prior service areas.\nOther - related party income increased $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Other - related party income includes royalty income based upon a percentage of certain FATHOM recurring revenue combined with the equity method gains and losses associated with our equity method investment in FATHOM Water Management Holdings, LLP (the \"FATHOM Partnership\"). As previously disclosed, based on the breach of the services agreement and cessation of services by GWM on December 20, 2019, the Company considers the services agreement to be terminated effective on that date. Additionally, the Company will no longer receive such royalty payments for periods after such date. The change in other - related party income was primarily driven by the equity method loss recorded on our investment in the FATHOM Partnership of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 6 - Equity Method Investment\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. The increase in Other - related party income was partially offset by a $63,000 decrease in royalty income for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense - Income tax expense of $1.2 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in pre-tax net income for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Income - Our net income totaled $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net income of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $0.9 million decrease was primarily attributed to ICFA revenue recognized in 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019, offset by Loop 303 proceeds and connection growth in 2019 compared to 2018.\nOutstanding Share Data\nAs of March 2, 2020, there were 22,537,381 shares of our common stock outstanding and options to acquire an additional 632,500 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur capital resources are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as debt and equity financing. Additionally, our regulated utility subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders, and real estate developers to partially fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. We use our capital resources to:\n\u2022fund operating costs;\n\u2022fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures;\n\u2022pay dividends;\n\u2022fund acquisitions;\n\u2022make debt and interest payments; and\n\u2022invest in new and existing ventures.\nOur utility subsidiaries operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited. Such recovery will take place over an extended period of time because recovery through rate increases is subject to regulatory lag.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have no notable near-term cash expenditures or debt obligations. While specific facts and circumstances could change, we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand, and the ability to draw on the $8.0 million available under the Loan Agreement (as defined below), to meet our operating cash flow requirements and capital expenditure plan as well as remain in compliance with our debt covenants for at least the next twelve months.\nIn March 2014, we initiated a dividend program to declare and pay a monthly dividend. On November 6, 2019, we announced a monthly dividend increase from $0.023861 per share ($0.286332 per share annually) to $0.0241 per share ($0.2892 per share annually). Although we expect monthly dividends will be declared and paid for the foreseeable future, the declaration of any dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and is subject to legal requirements and debt service ratio covenant requirements (refer to -Senior Secured Notes\" and \"-Revolving Credit Line\").\nCash from Operating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities are used for operating needs and to meet capital expenditure requirements. Our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by economic utility regulation, infrastructure investment, growth in service connections, customer usage of water, compliance with environmental health and safety standards, production costs, weather, and seasonality.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our net cash provided by operating activities totaled $11.6 million compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $0.3 million increase in cash from operating activities was primarily driven by the increase in other non-current liabilities of $0.9 million in 2019 compared to the $2.1 million decrease in 2018, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $0.9 million, coupled with a decrease in net income of $0.9 million.\nCash from Investing Activities\nOur net cash used in investing activities totaled $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $3.3 million change in cash used in investing activities was driven by a decrease in acquisition expenditures of $8.5 million due to the acquisition of Turner and Red Rock which were completed in 2018, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in capital expenditures primarily related to the deferral on the gain realized from the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia.\nWe continue to invest capital prudently in our existing, core service areas where we are able to deploy our Total Water Management model as service connections grow. This includes any required maintenance capital expenditures and the construction of new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities. Following the most recent Private Letter Ruling extension, we expect to fully defer the remaining tax liability of approximately $0.1 million as of December 31, 2019 in 2020 (refer to -Corporate Transactions-Private Letter Ruling\u201d). Our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.\nCash from Financing Activities\nOur net cash used in financing activities totaled $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a $15.1 million change as compared to the $9.5 million in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018. This change was primarily driven by the $14.6 million in net proceeds received from our public offering of stock in July 2018, combined with an increase in dividends paid of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was also due to a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercise of $0.4 million, offset by an increase of $0.4 million in AIAC payments received for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOn June 24, 2016, we issued two series of senior secured notes with a total principal balance of $115.0 million at a blended interest rate of 4.55%. Series A carries a principal balance of $28.8 million and bears an interest rate of 4.38% over a twelve-year term, with the principal payment due on June 15, 2028. Series B carries a principal balance of $86.3 million and bears an interest rate of 4.58% over a 20-year term. Series B is interest only for the first five years, with $1.9 million principal payments paid semiannually thereafter. The proceeds of the senior secured notes were primarily used to refinance our long-term tax exempt bonds, pursuant to an early redemption option at 103%, plus accrued interest, as a result of the initial public offering of our common stock in May 2016.\nThe senior secured notes require the Company to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated debt service of at least 1.10 to 1.00. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated as net income plus depreciation, taxes, interest and other non-cash charges net of non-cash income. Consolidated debt service is calculated as interest expense, principal payments, and dividend or stock repurchases. The senior secured notes also contain a provision limiting the payment of dividends if the Company falls below a debt service ratio of 1.25. However, for the quarter ending June 30, 2021 through the quarter ending March 31, 2024, the ratio drops to 1.20. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its financial debt covenants.\nDebt issuance costs as of both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were $0.6 million.\nRevolving Credit Line\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into a loan agreement (\"Loan Agreement\") with MidFirst Bank, a federally chartered savings association, on the terms and subject to conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement, for a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of $8.0 million. The Company intends to use the borrowings for future acquisitions and general corporate purposes.\nBorrowings under the Loan Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 2.25%. The original scheduled maturity date of April 30, 2020, subject to certain prepayment requirements upon a change of control, was extended in April 2019 to April 30, 2022. In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop requiring banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021. The Company's loan agreements dictate that the LIBOR rate will automatically convert to a rate of interest based on an adjustable index and spread that is reasonably equivalent to the LIBOR rate.\nSimilar to the senior secured notes, the Loan Agreement requires the Company to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated debt service of at least 1.10 to 1.00. The Loan Agreement also contains a provision limiting the payment of dividends if the Company falls below a debt service ratio of 1.25. Additionally, the Loan Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's ability to: create liens and other encumbrances; incur additional indebtedness; merge, liquidate or consolidate with another entity; dispose of or transfer assets; make distributions or other restricted payments (including dividends); engage in certain affiliate transactions; and change the nature of the business. The foregoing covenants are subject to various qualifications and limitations as set forth in the Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the revolving credit facility will be subject to certain customary events of default after which the revolving credit facility may be declared due and payable if not cured within the grace period or, in certain circumstances, may be declared due and payable immediately. Refer to Note 12 - \"Debt\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its financial debt covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this credit line. The Company incurred $40,000 debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2019 and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2018.\nInsurance Coverage\nWe carry various property, casualty, and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles, and exclusions consistent with industry standards. However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. We are self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our short-term and long-term financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\nThe application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates, assumptions, and other judgments. Additionally, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow are impacted by the methods, assumptions, and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. Although our management believes that these estimates, assumptions, and other judgments are appropriate, they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions, and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nEstimation of income taxes includes an evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the Company's ability to utilize the underlying future tax deductions against future taxable income before they expire. The Company's assessment is based upon existing tax laws and estimates of future taxable income. If the assessment of the Company's ability to utilize the underlying future tax deductions changes, the Company would be required to recognize fewer of the tax deductions as assets, which would increase the income tax expense in the period in which the determination is made.
