Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nBusiness\nWe are a clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on developing innovative products at the intersection of drugs and devices that address significant unmet medical needs in the treatment of cardiopulmonary diseases. The focus of our clinical program is the continued development of our nitric oxide therapy for patients with pulmonary hypertension, or PH, using our proprietary delivery system, INOpulse, with pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, representing the lead indication. Our INOpulse program is based on our proprietary pulsatile nitric oxide delivery device.\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH in October 2014, which is Part 1 of the trial. In February 2016, we announced positive data from the final analysis of our Phase 2 long-term extension clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which is Part 2 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH. The data reinforces the results from October 2014 and indicates a sustainability of benefit to PAH patients who received INOpulse therapy. After reaching agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, on our Phase 3 protocol, we are moving forward with Phase 3 development. In September 2015, the FDA issued a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, for our Phase 3 PAH program for INOpulse, which will include two confirmatory clinical trials, undertaken either sequentially or in parallel, with the first patient expected to be enrolled during the first half of 2016.\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-confirmation Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PH-COPD in July 2014. We have received results from this trial, and we are planning further Phase 2 testing to demonstrate the potential benefit on exercise capacity. In September 2015, an oral presentation of late-breaking data from a clinical trial sponsored by us was presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress 2015 in Amsterdam. The data showed that INOpulse improved vasodilation in patients with PH-COPD. We plan to build upon this and other work we have done over recent quarters to continue Phase 2 testing for the use of the INOpulse device for PH-COPD patients.\nWe are planning to undertake clinical testing of the INOpulse therapy to treat PH associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or PH-IPF, based on feedback from the medical community and the large unmet medical need for this condition. In addition, other opportunities for the application of our INOpulse program include the following indications: chronic thromboembolic PH, or CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness.\nWe presented detailed results from the PRESERVATION I trial for our Bioabsorbable Cardiac Matrix, or BCM, program at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in London on September 1, 2015. Following the results, we are considering further exploratory work but we do not intend to proceed with further clinical development of BCM at this point until and unless we can determine an alternative path forward.\nWe have devoted all of our resources to our therapeutic discovery and development efforts, including conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and the general and administrative support of these operations. We have devoted significant time and resources to developing and optimizing our drug delivery system, INOpulse, which operates through the administration of nitric oxide as brief, controlled pulses that are timed to occur at the beginning of a breath. In addition, in prior quarters, we had incurred significant costs to scale up manufacturing of BCM to support our clinical trials.\nTo date, we have generated no revenue from product sales. We expect that it will be several years before we commercialize a product candidate, if ever.\nRestructuring\nFollowing the results of our PRESERVATION I clinical trial for BCM, on September 11, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a staff reduction plan in order to reduce operating expenses and conserve cash resources, which we refer to as the Restructuring. The Restructuring included a workforce reduction of approximately 20 people completed in 2015. We offered severance benefits to the affected employees, including cash severance payments. Each affected employee's eligibility for the severance benefits was contingent upon such employee's execution (and non-revocation) of a separation agreement, which included a general release of claims against us. We recorded pre-tax charges of $1.4 million associated with the Restructuring, primarily consisting of the cash severance payments specified above. These charges were incurred largely in the third quarter of 2015 and are anticipated to be paid out in cash by March 2017.\nSeparation and Spin-Out from Ikaria\nPrior to February 2014, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ikaria, Inc. (a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt plc), or Ikaria. As part of an internal reorganization of Ikaria in October 2013, Ikaria transferred to us exclusive worldwide rights, with no royalty obligations, to develop and commercialize pulsed nitric oxide in PAH, PH-COPD and PH-IPF. In November 2015, we entered into an amendment to our exclusive cross-license, technology transfer and regulatory matters agreement with Ikaria that included a royalty equal to 3% of net sales of any commercial products for PAH. Following the internal reorganization, in February 2014, Ikaria distributed all of our then outstanding units to its stockholders through the payment of a special dividend on a pro rata basis based on each stockholder's ownership of Ikaria capital stock, which we refer to as the Spin-Out, and as a result we became a stand-alone company.\nOur inception date is August 26, 2009, which is the date that BCM was licensed to us by BioLineRx Ltd. and BioLine Innovations Jerusalem L.P., which we refer to collectively as BioLine. Our operations since that date have included organization and staffing, business planning, in-licensing technology, developing product candidates in clinical programs, evaluating potential future product candidates, as well as undertaking pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates.\nIn February 2014 and July 2015, we entered into a transition services agreement and an amendment to the transition services agreement, respectively, with Ikaria, which we refer to as the TSA. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the TSA, Ikaria agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide certain services to us until February 2016, the termination of which was accelerated to September 30, 2015 as part of the amendment, subject to the terms of the TSA. In exchange for the services provided by Ikaria pursuant to the TSA, we paid to Ikaria a service fee in the amount of $772,000 per month and reimbursed Ikaria for any out of pocket expenses, any taxes imposed on Ikaria in connection with the provision of services under the TSA.\nUnder our additional services agreement with Ikaria, or the 2015 Services Agreement, which became effective on January 1, 2015, Ikaria provided to us certain information technology and device maintenance services. In exchange for the services provided by Ikaria pursuant to the 2015 Services Agreement, we paid to Ikaria fees that totaled, in the aggregate, approximately $200,000. In July 2015, we entered into an amendment to the 2015 Services Agreement advancing the termination date from February 8, 2016 to September 30, 2015. Additionally, pursuant to the 2015 Services Agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide certain services to Ikaria, including services related to regulatory matters, drug and device safety, clinical operations, biometrics and scientific affairs. We also received payments of $1.7 million from Ikaria in connection with the 2015 Services Agreement.\nAccounting for the Separation and Spin-Out\nOur historical financial statements for periods prior to February 12, 2014, the date of the Spin-Out, discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations were derived from the audited historical financial statements and accounting records of Ikaria and include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs attributable to the research and development segment of Ikaria. In particular, for the period January 1, 2014 to February 11, 2014, our financial statements include expense allocations for (1) certain corporate functions historically provided by Ikaria, including finance, audit, legal, information technology and human resources services, (2) research and development expenses and (3) stock-based compensation. These allocations are based on either specific identification or allocation methods such as time and wage studies, headcount or other measures determined by us. Management believes that the statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the period of time prior to the Spin-Out includes a reasonable allocation of costs and expenses incurred by Ikaria from which we benefited. See Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDue to this presentation, the financial information for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not reflect what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows will be in the future or what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been in the past had we been a public, stand-alone company throughout the periods presented.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and may not generate any revenue from product sales for the next several years, if ever. In the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, license fees and milestone payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and royalties from the sale of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends primarily on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize or partner our product candidates as well as any product candidates we may advance in the future. We expect that any revenue we may generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of any payments we may receive under future partnerships, if any, and from sales of any products we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. If we fail to complete the development of any of our product candidates currently in clinical development or any future product candidates in a timely manner, or to obtain regulatory approval for such product candidates, our ability to generate future revenue, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates, including upfront and development milestone payments, related to in-licensed product candidates and technologies.\nIn order to fairly present our historical information for periods prior to the Spin-Out, certain departmental expenses from Ikaria have been allocated to us. The allocations were applied to us for the purpose of presenting our company as a stand-alone entity. Direct and indirect costs for periods prior to the Spin-Out related to the INOpulse and BCM clinical programs have been allocated to us. All allocations were based on actual costs incurred. For purposes of allocating non-project specific expenses, each Ikaria department head provided information as to the percentage of employee time incurred on our behalf.\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of:\n\u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salary, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and consultants that conduct a portion of our pre-clinical studies;\n\u00b7 expenses relating to vendors in connection with research and development activities;\n\u00b7 the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials;\n\u00b7 facilities, depreciation of fixed assets and allocated expenses;\n\u00b7 lab supplies, reagents, active pharmaceutical ingredients and other direct and indirect costs in support of our pre-clinical and clinical activities;\n\u00b7 device development and drug manufacturing engineering;\n\u00b7 license fees related to in-licensed products and technology; and\n\u00b7 costs associated with non-clinical activities and regulatory approvals.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred.\nConducting a significant amount of research and development is central to our business model. Product candidates in late stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development primarily due to the increased size and duration of late-stage clinical trials. Subject to the availability of requisite financing, we\nplan to increase our research and development expenses for ongoing clinical programs for the foreseeable future as we seek to continue multiple clinical trials for our product candidates, including to potentially advance INOpulse for PH-IPF, and seek to identify additional early-stage product candidates.\nWe track external research and development expenses and personnel expenses on a program-by-program basis. We use our employee and infrastructure resources, including regulatory, quality, clinical development and clinical operations, across our clinical development programs and have included these expenses in research and development infrastructure. Research and development laboratory expenses are also not allocated to a specific program and are included in research and development infrastructure. Engineering activities related to INOpulse and the manufacture of cylinders related to INOpulse are included in INOpulse engineering.\nINOpulse for PAH\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH in October 2014. The goal of the trial was to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two different doses of INOpulse for PAH. In February 2016, we performed the final analysis of our Phase 2 long-term extension clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which is Part 2 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which reinforced the results from Part 1 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH. After reaching agreement with the FDA and the EMA on our Phase 3 protocol, we are moving forward with Phase 3 development.\nINOpulse for PH-COPD\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-confirmation Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PH-COPD in July 2014. We have received results from this trial, and we are planning further Phase 2 testing in 2016 to demonstrate the potential benefit of INOpulse on exercise capacity.\nINOpulse for PH-IPF\nWe also plan to initiate our Phase 2 studies in PH-IPF in 2016 consisting of an exploratory acute hemodynamic study followed by exercise capacity.\nBCM\nWe initiated a clinical trial of BCM, which we refer to as our PRESERVATION I trial, in December 2011, enrolled the first patient in April 2012 and completed enrollment in December 2014. Top-line results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial were announced in July 2015. From a safety perspective we observed no significant difference in adverse events rates between patients in the BCM and placebo treatment groups. However, the data showed no statistically significant treatment differences between patients treated with BCM and patients treated with placebo for both the primary and secondary endpoints in the trial. We presented detailed results from the PRESERVATION I trial for our BCM program at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in London on September 1, 2015. Following the results, we are considering further exploratory work but we do not intend to proceed with further clinical development of BCM at this point until and unless we can determine an alternative path forward.\nResearch and Development Infrastructure\nWe invest in regulatory, quality, clinical development and clinical operations activities, which are expensed as incurred. These activities primarily support our clinical development programs.\nINOpulse Engineering\nWe have invested a significant amount of funds in INOpulse, which is configured to be highly portable and compatible with available modes of long-term oxygen therapy via nasal cannula delivery. Our Phase 2 clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD utilized the first generation INOpulse DS device. We believe our second generation INOpulse device, as well as a custom triple-lumen cannula, will significantly improve several characteristics of our INOpulse delivery system. We have also invested in design and engineering technology, through Ikaria, for the manufacture of our drug cartridges. In February 2015, we entered into an agreement with Flextronics Medical Sales and Marketing Ltd., a subsidiary of Flextronics International Ltd., or Flextronics, to manufacture and service the INOpulse devices that we will use in future clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD and PH-IPF.\nIt is difficult to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of our current or any future pre-clinical programs and any of our current or future clinical trials and any future product candidates we may advance, or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of any future clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate and significant and changing government regulation. In addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could change significantly the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time with respect to the development of that product candidate. We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, as well as an assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential, including the likelihood of regulatory approval on a timely basis.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and costs related to executive, finance, business development, marketing, legal and human resources functions, either through direct expenses or the TSA. Other general and administrative expenses include patent filing, patent prosecution, professional fees for legal, insurance, consulting, information technology and auditing and tax services not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe believe that the following factors, among others, will affect the amount of our general and administrative expenses in the future:\n\u00b7 we expect to incur reduced general and administrative expenses following the completion of the Restructuring;\n\u00b7 we expect to incur reduced general and administrative expenses previously paid to Ikaria following the expiration of the TSA and the 2015 Services Agreement, in each case on September 30, 2015; and\n\u00b7 we expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses to replace services previously provided to us by Ikaria under the TSA such as accounting and financial management support, human resources support, drug and device safety services, biometrics support, information technology services and manufacturing and device servicing support.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, together with the changes in these items in dollars and as a percentage.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BCM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,506\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PAH\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(641\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PH-COPD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,054\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clinical programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,111\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INOpulse engineering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,667\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,667\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n.a.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,568\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59,753\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss and comprehensive loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46,459\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(59,674\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $48.2 million compared to $59.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $11.6 million, or 19%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in research and development expenses pertaining to our BCM and INOpulse for PH-COPD programs and to a decrease in research and development infrastructure expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Total research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $33.4 million compared to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $12.6 million, or 27%. Total research and development expenses consisted of the following:\n\u00b7 BCM research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $8.2 million compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $5.5 million, or 40%. The decrease was primarily due to us ceasing further clinical development of BCM following the PRESERVATION I results.\n\u00b7 PAH research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $10.7 million compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 6%. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial in late-2014 and a reversal of an accrual in the year ended December 31, 2015 partially offset by increased costs in anticipation of the start of the Phase 3 clinical trials.\n\u00b7 PH-COPD research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $0.0 million compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 100%. The decrease primarily resulted from the completion of the Phase 2a clinical trial in mid-2014.\n\u00b7 Research and development infrastructure expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $8.6 million compared to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $3.1 million, or 27%. The decrease was due to reductions in infrastructure spending to support our INOpulse and BCM clinical programs and the discontinuance of cash bonuses. In September 2015, we decided to pay 2015 bonuses by granting employees restricted stock awards which will vest over a one-year period from the date of grant. Accordingly, the related cost will be recognized over such period.\n\u00b7 INOpulse engineering expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $6.0 million compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 5%.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $14.9 million compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.1 million, or 8%. The increase was primarily due to restructuring charges of $1.1 million and additional costs of operating as a public company, including expenses related to transition services from Ikaria and other professional services offset, in part, by the discontinuance of cash bonuses. In September 2015, we decided to pay 2015 bonuses by granting employees restricted stock awards which will vest over a one-year period from the date of grant. Accordingly, the related cost will be recognized over such period.\nOther Operating Income. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.7 million, and we had no operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase resulted from payments received from Ikaria in connection with entering into the 2015 Services Agreement.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, together with the changes in these items in dollars and as a percentage.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BCM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,606\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PAH\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PH-COPD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,394\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clinical programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,780\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,325\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INOpulse engineering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,007\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n.a.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss and comprehensive loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(59,674\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(61,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $59.8 million compared to $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 4%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in research and development expenses pertaining to our BCM and INOpulse for PH-COPD programs and to decreased research and development infrastructure expenses, partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses pertaining to INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse engineering expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Total research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $46.0 million compared to $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $7.0 million, or 13%. Total research and development expenses consisted of the following:\n\u00b7 BCM research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $13.7 million compared to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 21%. The decrease primarily resulted from the effect of certain non-recurring manufacturing costs in the 2013 period, as well as a decrease in the pre-clinical activities that we conducted with respect to BCM during the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in clinical trial costs as a result of an increase in patient enrollments in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year period.\n\u00b7 PAH research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $11.3 million compared to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $3.2 million, or 40%. The increase was primarily due to higher clinical trial expenses in the year ended December 31, 2014, driven by higher patient enrollment costs as compared to the prior year period, as well as increased spending in respect of development of the INOpulse device in preparation for our anticipated Phase 3 clinical trial.\n\u00b7 PH-COPD research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $3.0 million compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $5.4 million, or 64%. The decrease primarily resulted from lower dosing trial costs as a result of the completion of our Phase 2 clinical trial.\n\u00b7 Research and development infrastructure expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $11.7 million compared to $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 17%. The decrease was primarily the result of reductions in headcount in connection with managing staffing needs to support our INOpulse and BCM clinical programs.\n\u00b7 INOpulse engineering expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $6.3 million compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $1.1 million, or 21%. The increase was primarily due to increases in development costs as we transitioned from the INOpulse DS device to the newer INOpulse device.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $13.8 million compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $4.8 million, or 53%. The increase was primarily due to the incremental costs of operating as a stand-alone entity, including professional service fees, executive search costs, the payment of certain retention bonuses and information technology expenditures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn the course of our development activities, we have sustained operating losses and expect such losses to continue over the next several years.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 million and marketable securities of $17.8 million as of December 31, 2015. We received net proceeds of $51.9 million in February 2015 as a result of the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $4.2 million and offering costs of $3.9 million.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, third-party clinical research and development services, contract manufacturing services, laboratory and related supplies, clinical costs, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs.\nIf we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses. We do not currently have the infrastructure for the sale, marketing, manufacture or distribution of any products. To develop a commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to having any certainty of marketing approval.\nOur existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $24.1 million as of December 31, 2015 will be used primarily to fund the first of two INOpulse for PAH Phase 3 trials, in which we expect to enroll the first patient in the first half of 2016. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had $11.3 million prepayments of research and development expenses related to our amended drug supply agreement with Ikaria and the clinical research organization we have partnered with for the first of the two Phase 3 clinical trials for INOpulse for PAH. We believe, as of December 31, 2015, we have sufficient funds to satisfy our operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months due in part to the Restructuring and other cost saving initiatives.\nWe expect these funds, combined with additional funding anticipated from Global Corporate Finance, or GCF, will be sufficient to complete the first of two PAH Phase 3 trials. During December 2015, we entered into a letter agreement with GCF. In accordance with the terms of the letter agreement, we have agreed to place with GCF up $20 million of our common stock subject to the execution of a definitive share purchase agreement and registration rights agreement. We may not draw down amounts that would result in GCF owning more than 19.9% of our outstanding shares. The first two draw downs under this letter agreement may not exceed $2 million. Thereafter, the draw down amounts will depend on the average daily trading volume of our shares.\nWe have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect. In addition, the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress in clinical trials is uncertain. Because our product candidates are in clinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts that will be necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the timing, progress and results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH, PH-COPD and PH-IPF;\n\u00b7 our ability to manufacture sufficient supply of our product candidates and the costs thereof;\n\u00b7 discussions with regulatory agencies regarding the design and conduct of our clinical trials and the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7 the number and development requirements of any other product candidates we pursue;\n\u00b7 our ability to enter into collaborative agreements and achieve milestones under those agreements;\n\u00b7 the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\u00b7 our expenses as a stand-alone company; and\n\u00b7 the extent to which we acquire or in-license other products and technologies.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity and debt offerings, existing working capital and funding from potential future collaboration arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences or rights such as anti-dilution rights that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46,264\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(70,562\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57,231\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,305\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(727\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,555\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $46.3 million compared to $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $24.3 million, or 34%. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to reduced research and development expenses and the recognition in the year ended December 31, 2014 of the $10.8 million restricted cash balance related to the escrow payment due to Ikaria, which was utilized to pay Ikaria during 2015, offset in part by a $6.6 million prepayment made to Ikaria as part of amending our drug supply agreement and an $8.0 million prepayment made to the clinical research organization we have partnered with for the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials for INOpulse for PAH.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $70.6 million compared to $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $13.4 million, or 23%. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the deposit of escrowed cash in connection with the TSA.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $18.3 million, including $0.5 million for capital expenditures related to our new office space in Warren, New Jersey and $22.7 million for the purchase of marketable securities, offset by $4.9 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. There were no cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.7 million of capital expenditures.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $54.0 million compared to $87.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $33.4 million, or 38%. The decrease resulted from the difference between the $53.8 million net proceeds from our IPO in the year ended December 31, 2015, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $4.2 million and offering costs of $2.0 million paid, compared to the $89.3 million net investment by Ikaria, primarily due to a cash contribution of $80.0 million from Ikaria in the year ended December 31, 2014 in connection with the Spin-Out.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $87.4 million compared to $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $29.4 million, or 51%. The increase was primarily due to a cash contribution of $80.0 million from Ikaria in connection with the Spin-Out.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following is a summary of our long-term contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period ($)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flextronics Agreement(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Operating lease obligations include the lease agreement we entered into on August 6, 2015 for office space in Warren, New Jersey and our lease of an operating facility located in North Brunswick, New Jersey.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(2) On March 25, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Flextronics to manufacture and service the INOpulse devices that we expect to use in future clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD. Under the agreement, we have committed to purchase devices.\nRoyalty payments and success-based milestones associated with our license and supply agreements with Ikaria and have not been included in the above table of contractual obligations as we cannot reasonably estimate if or when they will occur.\nWe do not intend to proceed with further clinical development of BCM until and unless we can determine an alternative path forward. Consequently, any future royalty and milestones payments to BioLine would depend on finding a path forward for future clinical development. Under the terms of the license agreement, if we achieve certain clinical and regulatory events specified in the license agreement, we will be obligated to pay milestone payments to BioLine, which could total, in the aggregate, up to $115.5 million, and if we achieve certain commercialization targets specified in the license agreement, we will be obligated to pay additional milestone payments to BioLine, which could total, in the aggregate, up to $150.0 million. In addition, we will be obligated to pay BioLine a specified percentage of any upfront consideration we receive for sublicensing BCM, as well as royalties on net sales, if any, at a percentage ranging from 11% to 15%, depending on net sales level, of any approved product containing BCM, subject to offsets for specified payments to third parties made in connection with BCM. We have reimbursed BioLine for certain legal fees in the amount of $250,000 following completion of our IPO.\nIn the course of our normal business operations, we also enter into agreements with contract service providers and others to assist in the performance of our research and development and manufacturing activities. We can elect to discontinue the work under these contracts and purchase orders at any time with notice, and such contracts and purchase orders do not contain minimum purchase obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to research and development expense, impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary research and development efforts, as well as costs incurred in connection with certain licensing arrangements. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties upon or subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. We also expense the cost of purchased technology and equipment in the period of purchase if we believe that the technology or equipment has not demonstrated technological feasibility and does not have an alternative future use. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and are recognized as research and development expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate a portion of our accrued research expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We make such estimates of our incurred research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include:\n\u00b7 fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials;\n\u00b7 fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials; and\n\u00b7 fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials.\nWe base our expenses related to research and development and clinical trials on actual costs incurred in addition to our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple third parties, including research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing the research and development service fees, we consider the terms of each agreement, the time period over which the services will be performed and the level of effort required to complete the service. If the actual timing of the performance of the services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe issue, and prior to the Spin-Out Ikaria, our former parent, issued, stock-based awards to employees and non-employees in the form of stock options, restricted stock awards, or RSAs, and restricted stock units, or RSUs. The stock-based compensation expense recorded for the periods prior to the Spin-Out presented in our audited financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, represents an allocation of Ikaria's stock-based compensation expense based on the allocation percentages of our cost centers, which were determined based on specific identification or the proportionate percentage of employee time or headcount to the respective total Ikaria employee time or headcount. Because certain of these amounts relate to Ikaria stock-based awards, the amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily reflect the stock-based compensation or compensation expense that we would have experienced as a stand-alone company for these periods.\nWe account for our stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 718 Compensation- Stock Compensation, which establishes accounting for share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock, exchanged for services and requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of these awards over the requisite service period. We recognize stock-based compensation expense in operations based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant. The resulting compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period or sooner if the awards immediately vest.\nDetermining the appropriate fair value of stock-based awards requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our units and, for options, the expected term of the option and expected volatility. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value our stock option awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management's best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and management uses different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different for future awards. The expected term of stock options is estimated using the simplified method,\u201d as we have no historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior for our stock options grants. The simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant. For volatility, we use comparable public companies as a basis for our expected volatility to calculate the fair value of option grants due to our limited history as a public company. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected term of the option. For restricted stock, the fair value is the closing market price per share on the grant date. The estimation of the number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period in which estimates are revised.\nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of options issued during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $6.55 and $9.98, respectively. The following are the weighted average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of options issued during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>1.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected volatility\n</td> <td>79.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>90.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend yield\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the period presented prior to the Spin-Out, the weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors of Ikaria and the weighted average assumptions used by Ikaria to estimate the grant date fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model were:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average grant date fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>0.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected volatility\n</td> <td>46.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere were no Ikaria options issued during the period from January 1, 2014 through February 11, 2014.\nIkaria has historically granted its stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair value of its common stock. Ikaria was a private company with no active public market for its common stock. Therefore, its board of directors periodically determined for financial reporting purposes the estimated fair value of its common stock using valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation , also known as the Practice Aid.\nThe compensation expense for the RSUs was based on the grant date fair value of the RSU, which was based on the fair value of the underlying stock.\nIn February 2014, prior to the Spin-Out, each Ikaria stock option, other than options held by non-accredited investors who were also not employees of Ikaria, was adjusted such that it became an option to acquire the same number of shares of Ikaria non-voting common stock as were subject to the Ikaria stock option, or an Adjusted Ikaria Option, and an option to acquire the same number of our non-voting limited liability company units as the number of shares of Ikaria non-voting common stock that were subject to the Ikaria stock option, or a Bellerophon Option. There were 618,212 Bellerophon Options issued as a result of the adjustment of Ikaria stock options. The vesting of each Adjusted Ikaria Option and Bellerophon Option was fully accelerated on the date of the Spin-Out and all related compensation expense was recognized as an expense by Ikaria.\nPrior to and in connection with the Spin-Out, the exercise price of each Adjusted Ikaria Option and Bellerophon Option was adjusted by allocating the relative post Spin-Out estimated fair values of Ikaria and us in a ratio of 85% and 15%, respectively, to the original Ikaria option exercise price. The expiration date of the options was not modified.\nOn June 20, 2014, following the Spin-Out, we granted options to purchase 514,266 of our non-voting units with an exercise price of $13.28 per non-voting unit. As we were a private company with no active public market for our equity securities at the time, the estimated fair value of one of our non-voting units as of June 20, 2014, was determined by our board of directors to be $13.28. In making this determination, our board of directors used a contemporaneous valuation based on the income approach, performed in accordance with the guidance enumerated in the Practice Aid. For the income approach, we used the discounted cash flow method to estimate the present value of the future monetary benefits expected to flow to the owners of the business. The contemporaneous valuation also considered factors enumerated in Revenue Ruling 59-60, which serves as a general guideline for the valuation of closely held securities. In addition, we considered all objective and subjective factors that we believe to be relevant to such valuation, including our best estimate of our business condition, prospects and operating performance at the valuation date. Within the contemporaneous valuation performed, a range of factors and assumptions were used. The significant factors, many of them complex and highly subjective, included:\n\u00b7 estimates of our future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate;\n\u00b7 the nature and history of our business enterprise;\n\u00b7 the assessment of key value drivers for our business enterprise;\n\u00b7 the economic outlook in general and the condition and outlook of our industry in particular;\n\u00b7 the financial condition of our business and the book value of our equity interests;\n\u00b7 the likelihood of our achieving a liquidity event; and\n\u00b7 prior sales of equity interests of companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business that have their stocks actively traded in a free and open market.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we adopted the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2014 Plan, which provides for the grant of options. Following the effectiveness of our registration statement filed in connection with our IPO, no options may be granted under the 2014 Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we adopted the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2015 Plan, which provides for the grant of options, restricted stock and other forms of equity compensation.\nSince our IPO, the exercise price per share of all option grants has been set at the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on the applicable date of grant.\nThe compensation expense for the RSAs was based on the grant date fair value of the RSA, which was based on the fair value of the underlying stock.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded stock-based expenses as follows:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d. This guidance clarifies that an entity's management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and annual and interim periods thereafter, and early application is permitted. We are assessing ASU 2014-15's impact and will adopt it when effective.\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are assessing ASU 2014-09's impact and will adopt it when effective.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases\", which is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This standard requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by lease terms of more than 12 months. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) December 31, 2020; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the first day of the year following the first year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u00b7 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u00b7 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In particular, we have not included all of the executive compensation information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on certain or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.", "summary": "- The provided table displays the percentage change in revenue for each industry compared to the previous year\n- The table is

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nBusiness\nWe are a clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on developing innovative products at the intersection of drugs and devices that address significant unmet medical needs in the treatment of cardiopulmonary diseases. The focus of our clinical program is the continued development of our nitric oxide therapy for patients with pulmonary hypertension, or PH, using our proprietary delivery system, INOpulse, with pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, representing the lead indication. Our INOpulse program is based on our proprietary pulsatile nitric oxide delivery device.\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH in October 2014, which is Part 1 of the trial. In February 2016, we announced positive data from the final analysis of our Phase 2 long-term extension clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which is Part 2 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH. The data reinforces the results from October 2014 and indicates a sustainability of benefit to PAH patients who received INOpulse therapy. After reaching agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, on our Phase 3 protocol, we are moving forward with Phase 3 development. In September 2015, the FDA issued a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, for our Phase 3 PAH program for INOpulse, which will include two confirmatory clinical trials, undertaken either sequentially or in parallel, with the first patient expected to be enrolled during the first half of 2016.\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-confirmation Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PH-COPD in July 2014. We have received results from this trial, and we are planning further Phase 2 testing to demonstrate the potential benefit on exercise capacity. In September 2015, an oral presentation of late-breaking data from a clinical trial sponsored by us was presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress 2015 in Amsterdam. The data showed that INOpulse improved vasodilation in patients with PH-COPD. We plan to build upon this and other work we have done over recent quarters to continue Phase 2 testing for the use of the INOpulse device for PH-COPD patients.\nWe are planning to undertake clinical testing of the INOpulse therapy to treat PH associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or PH-IPF, based on feedback from the medical community and the large unmet medical need for this condition. In addition, other opportunities for the application of our INOpulse program include the following indications: chronic thromboembolic PH, or CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness.\nWe presented detailed results from the PRESERVATION I trial for our Bioabsorbable Cardiac Matrix, or BCM, program at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in London on September 1, 2015. Following the results, we are considering further exploratory work but we do not intend to proceed with further clinical development of BCM at this point until and unless we can determine an alternative path forward.\nWe have devoted all of our resources to our therapeutic discovery and development efforts, including conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and the general and administrative support of these operations. We have devoted significant time and resources to developing and optimizing our drug delivery system, INOpulse, which operates through the administration of nitric oxide as brief, controlled pulses that are timed to occur at the beginning of a breath. In addition, in prior quarters, we had incurred significant costs to scale up manufacturing of BCM to support our clinical trials.\nTo date, we have generated no revenue from product sales. We expect that it will be several years before we commercialize a product candidate, if ever.\nRestructuring\nFollowing the results of our PRESERVATION I clinical trial for BCM, on September 11, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a staff reduction plan in order to reduce operating expenses and conserve cash resources, which we refer to as the Restructuring. The Restructuring included a workforce reduction of approximately 20 people completed in 2015. We offered severance benefits to the affected employees, including cash severance payments. Each affected employee's eligibility for the severance benefits was contingent upon such employee's execution (and non-revocation) of a separation agreement, which included a general release of claims against us. We recorded pre-tax charges of $1.4 million associated with the Restructuring, primarily consisting of the cash severance payments specified above. These charges were incurred largely in the third quarter of 2015 and are anticipated to be paid out in cash by March 2017.\nSeparation and Spin-Out from Ikaria\nPrior to February 2014, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ikaria, Inc. (a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt plc), or Ikaria. As part of an internal reorganization of Ikaria in October 2013, Ikaria transferred to us exclusive worldwide rights, with no royalty obligations, to develop and commercialize pulsed nitric oxide in PAH, PH-COPD and PH-IPF. In November 2015, we entered into an amendment to our exclusive cross-license, technology transfer and regulatory matters agreement with Ikaria that included a royalty equal to 3% of net sales of any commercial products for PAH. Following the internal reorganization, in February 2014, Ikaria distributed all of our then outstanding units to its stockholders through the payment of a special dividend on a pro rata basis based on each stockholder's ownership of Ikaria capital stock, which we refer to as the Spin-Out, and as a result we became a stand-alone company.\nOur inception date is August 26, 2009, which is the date that BCM was licensed to us by BioLineRx Ltd. and BioLine Innovations Jerusalem L.P., which we refer to collectively as BioLine. Our operations since that date have included organization and staffing, business planning, in-licensing technology, developing product candidates in clinical programs, evaluating potential future product candidates, as well as undertaking pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates.\nIn February 2014 and July 2015, we entered into a transition services agreement and an amendment to the transition services agreement, respectively, with Ikaria, which we refer to as the TSA. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the TSA, Ikaria agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide certain services to us until February 2016, the termination of which was accelerated to September 30, 2015 as part of the amendment, subject to the terms of the TSA. In exchange for the services provided by Ikaria pursuant to the TSA, we paid to Ikaria a service fee in the amount of $772,000 per month and reimbursed Ikaria for any out of pocket expenses, any taxes imposed on Ikaria in connection with the provision of services under the TSA.\nUnder our additional services agreement with Ikaria, or the 2015 Services Agreement, which became effective on January 1, 2015, Ikaria provided to us certain information technology and device maintenance services. In exchange for the services provided by Ikaria pursuant to the 2015 Services Agreement, we paid to Ikaria fees that totaled, in the aggregate, approximately $200,000. In July 2015, we entered into an amendment to the 2015 Services Agreement advancing the termination date from February 8, 2016 to September 30, 2015. Additionally, pursuant to the 2015 Services Agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide certain services to Ikaria, including services related to regulatory matters, drug and device safety, clinical operations, biometrics and scientific affairs. We also received payments of $1.7 million from Ikaria in connection with the 2015 Services Agreement.\nAccounting for the Separation and Spin-Out\nOur historical financial statements for periods prior to February 12, 2014, the date of the Spin-Out, discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations were derived from the audited historical financial statements and accounting records of Ikaria and include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs attributable to the research and development segment of Ikaria. In particular, for the period January 1, 2014 to February 11, 2014, our financial statements include expense allocations for (1) certain corporate functions historically provided by Ikaria, including finance, audit, legal, information technology and human resources services, (2) research and development expenses and (3) stock-based compensation. These allocations are based on either specific identification or allocation methods such as time and wage studies, headcount or other measures determined by us. Management believes that the statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the period of time prior to the Spin-Out includes a reasonable allocation of costs and expenses incurred by Ikaria from which we benefited. See Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDue to this presentation, the financial information for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not reflect what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows will be in the future or what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been in the past had we been a public, stand-alone company throughout the periods presented.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and may not generate any revenue from product sales for the next several years, if ever. In the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, license fees and milestone payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and royalties from the sale of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends primarily on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize or partner our product candidates as well as any product candidates we may advance in the future. We expect that any revenue we may generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of any payments we may receive under future partnerships, if any, and from sales of any products we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. If we fail to complete the development of any of our product candidates currently in clinical development or any future product candidates in a timely manner, or to obtain regulatory approval for such product candidates, our ability to generate future revenue, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates, including upfront and development milestone payments, related to in-licensed product candidates and technologies.\nIn order to fairly present our historical information for periods prior to the Spin-Out, certain departmental expenses from Ikaria have been allocated to us. The allocations were applied to us for the purpose of presenting our company as a stand-alone entity. Direct and indirect costs for periods prior to the Spin-Out related to the INOpulse and BCM clinical programs have been allocated to us. All allocations were based on actual costs incurred. For purposes of allocating non-project specific expenses, each Ikaria department head provided information as to the percentage of employee time incurred on our behalf.\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of:\n\u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salary, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and consultants that conduct a portion of our pre-clinical studies;\n\u00b7 expenses relating to vendors in connection with research and development activities;\n\u00b7 the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials;\n\u00b7 facilities, depreciation of fixed assets and allocated expenses;\n\u00b7 lab supplies, reagents, active pharmaceutical ingredients and other direct and indirect costs in support of our pre-clinical and clinical activities;\n\u00b7 device development and drug manufacturing engineering;\n\u00b7 license fees related to in-licensed products and technology; and\n\u00b7 costs associated with non-clinical activities and regulatory approvals.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred.\nConducting a significant amount of research and development is central to our business model. Product candidates in late stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development primarily due to the increased size and duration of late-stage clinical trials. Subject to the availability of requisite financing, we\nplan to increase our research and development expenses for ongoing clinical programs for the foreseeable future as we seek to continue multiple clinical trials for our product candidates, including to potentially advance INOpulse for PH-IPF, and seek to identify additional early-stage product candidates.\nWe track external research and development expenses and personnel expenses on a program-by-program basis. We use our employee and infrastructure resources, including regulatory, quality, clinical development and clinical operations, across our clinical development programs and have included these expenses in research and development infrastructure. Research and development laboratory expenses are also not allocated to a specific program and are included in research and development infrastructure. Engineering activities related to INOpulse and the manufacture of cylinders related to INOpulse are included in INOpulse engineering.\nINOpulse for PAH\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH in October 2014. The goal of the trial was to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two different doses of INOpulse for PAH. In February 2016, we performed the final analysis of our Phase 2 long-term extension clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which is Part 2 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which reinforced the results from Part 1 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH. After reaching agreement with the FDA and the EMA on our Phase 3 protocol, we are moving forward with Phase 3 development.\nINOpulse for PH-COPD\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-confirmation Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PH-COPD in July 2014. We have received results from this trial, and we are planning further Phase 2 testing in 2016 to demonstrate the potential benefit of INOpulse on exercise capacity.\nINOpulse for PH-IPF\nWe also plan to initiate our Phase 2 studies in PH-IPF in 2016 consisting of an exploratory acute hemodynamic study followed by exercise capacity.\nBCM\nWe initiated a clinical trial of BCM, which we refer to as our PRESERVATION I trial, in December 2011, enrolled the first patient in April 2012 and completed enrollment in December 2014. Top-line results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial were announced in July 2015. From a safety perspective we observed no significant difference in adverse events rates between patients in the BCM and placebo treatment groups. However, the data showed no statistically significant treatment differences between patients treated with BCM and patients treated with placebo for both the primary and secondary endpoints in the trial. We presented detailed results from the PRESERVATION I trial for our BCM program at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in London on September 1, 2015. Following the results, we are considering further exploratory work but we do not intend to proceed with further clinical development of BCM at this point until and unless we can determine an alternative path forward.\nResearch and Development Infrastructure\nWe invest in regulatory, quality, clinical development and clinical operations activities, which are expensed as incurred. These activities primarily support our clinical development programs.\nINOpulse Engineering\nWe have invested a significant amount of funds in INOpulse, which is configured to be highly portable and compatible with available modes of long-term oxygen therapy via nasal cannula delivery. Our Phase 2 clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD utilized the first generation INOpulse DS device. We believe our second generation INOpulse device, as well as a custom triple-lumen cannula, will significantly improve several characteristics of our INOpulse delivery system. We have also invested in design and engineering technology, through Ikaria, for the manufacture of our drug cartridges. In February 2015, we entered into an agreement with Flextronics Medical Sales and Marketing Ltd., a subsidiary of Flextronics International Ltd., or Flextronics, to manufacture and service the INOpulse devices that we will use in future clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD and PH-IPF.\nIt is difficult to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of our current or any future pre-clinical programs and any of our current or future clinical trials and any future product candidates we may advance, or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of any future clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate and significant and changing government regulation. In addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could change significantly the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time with respect to the development of that product candidate. We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, as well as an assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential, including the likelihood of regulatory approval on a timely basis.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and costs related to executive, finance, business development, marketing, legal and human resources functions, either through direct expenses or the TSA. Other general and administrative expenses include patent filing, patent prosecution, professional fees for legal, insurance, consulting, information technology and auditing and tax services not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe believe that the following factors, among others, will affect the amount of our general and administrative expenses in the future:\n\u00b7 we expect to incur reduced general and administrative expenses following the completion of the Restructuring;\n\u00b7 we expect to incur reduced general and administrative expenses previously paid to Ikaria following the expiration of the TSA and the 2015 Services Agreement, in each case on September 30, 2015; and\n\u00b7 we expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses to replace services previously provided to us by Ikaria under the TSA such as accounting and financial management support, human resources support, drug and device safety services, biometrics support, information technology services and manufacturing and device servicing support.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, together with the changes in these items in dollars and as a percentage.\n\nTotal Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $48.2 million compared to $59.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $11.6 million, or 19%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in research and development expenses pertaining to our BCM and INOpulse for PH-COPD programs and to a decrease in research and development infrastructure expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Total research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $33.4 million compared to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $12.6 million, or 27%. Total research and development expenses consisted of the following:\n\u00b7 BCM research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $8.2 million compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $5.5 million, or 40%. The decrease was primarily due to us ceasing further clinical development of BCM following the PRESERVATION I results.\n\u00b7 PAH research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $10.7 million compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 6%. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial in late-2014 and a reversal of an accrual in the year ended December 31, 2015 partially offset by increased costs in anticipation of the start of the Phase 3 clinical trials.\n\u00b7 PH-COPD research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $0.0 million compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 100%. The decrease primarily resulted from the completion of the Phase 2a clinical trial in mid-2014.\n\u00b7 Research and development infrastructure expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $8.6 million compared to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $3.1 million, or 27%. The decrease was due to reductions in infrastructure spending to support our INOpulse and BCM clinical programs and the discontinuance of cash bonuses. In September 2015, we decided to pay 2015 bonuses by granting employees restricted stock awards which will vest over a one-year period from the date of grant. Accordingly, the related cost will be recognized over such period.\n\u00b7 INOpulse engineering expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $6.0 million compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 5%.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $14.9 million compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.1 million, or 8%. The increase was primarily due to restructuring charges of $1.1 million and additional costs of operating as a public company, including expenses related to transition services from Ikaria and other professional services offset, in part, by the discontinuance of cash bonuses. In September 2015, we decided to pay 2015 bonuses by granting employees restricted stock awards which will vest over a one-year period from the date of grant. Accordingly, the related cost will be recognized over such period.\nOther Operating Income. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.7 million, and we had no operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase resulted from payments received from Ikaria in connection with entering into the 2015 Services Agreement.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, together with the changes in these items in dollars and as a percentage.\n\nTotal Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $59.8 million compared to $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 4%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in research and development expenses pertaining to our BCM and INOpulse for PH-COPD programs and to decreased research and development infrastructure expenses, partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses pertaining to INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse engineering expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Total research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $46.0 million compared to $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $7.0 million, or 13%. Total research and development expenses consisted of the following:\n\u00b7 BCM research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $13.7 million compared to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 21%. The decrease primarily resulted from the effect of certain non-recurring manufacturing costs in the 2013 period, as well as a decrease in the pre-clinical activities that we conducted with respect to BCM during the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in clinical trial costs as a result of an increase in patient enrollments in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year period.\n\u00b7 PAH research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $11.3 million compared to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $3.2 million, or 40%. The increase was primarily due to higher clinical trial expenses in the year ended December 31, 2014, driven by higher patient enrollment costs as compared to the prior year period, as well as increased spending in respect of development of the INOpulse device in preparation for our anticipated Phase 3 clinical trial.\n\u00b7 PH-COPD research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $3.0 million compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $5.4 million, or 64%. The decrease primarily resulted from lower dosing trial costs as a result of the completion of our Phase 2 clinical trial.\n\u00b7 Research and development infrastructure expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $11.7 million compared to $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 17%. The decrease was primarily the result of reductions in headcount in connection with managing staffing needs to support our INOpulse and BCM clinical programs.\n\u00b7 INOpulse engineering expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $6.3 million compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $1.1 million, or 21%. The increase was primarily due to increases in development costs as we transitioned from the INOpulse DS device to the newer INOpulse device.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $13.8 million compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $4.8 million, or 53%. The increase was primarily due to the incremental costs of operating as a stand-alone entity, including professional service fees, executive search costs, the payment of certain retention bonuses and information technology expenditures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn the course of our development activities, we have sustained operating losses and expect such losses to continue over the next several years.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 million and marketable securities of $17.8 million as of December 31, 2015. We received net proceeds of $51.9 million in February 2015 as a result of the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $4.2 million and offering costs of $3.9 million.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, third-party clinical research and development services, contract manufacturing services, laboratory and related supplies, clinical costs, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs.\nIf we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses. We do not currently have the infrastructure for the sale, marketing, manufacture or distribution of any products. To develop a commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to having any certainty of marketing approval.\nOur existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $24.1 million as of December 31, 2015 will be used primarily to fund the first of two INOpulse for PAH Phase 3 trials, in which we expect to enroll the first patient in the first half of 2016. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had $11.3 million prepayments of research and development expenses related to our amended drug supply agreement with Ikaria and the clinical research organization we have partnered with for the first of the two Phase 3 clinical trials for INOpulse for PAH. We believe, as of December 31, 2015, we have sufficient funds to satisfy our operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months due in part to the Restructuring and other cost saving initiatives.\nWe expect these funds, combined with additional funding anticipated from Global Corporate Finance, or GCF, will be sufficient to complete the first of two PAH Phase 3 trials. During December 2015, we entered into a letter agreement with GCF. In accordance with the terms of the letter agreement, we have agreed to place with GCF up $20 million of our common stock subject to the execution of a definitive share purchase agreement and registration rights agreement. We may not draw down amounts that would result in GCF owning more than 19.9% of our outstanding shares. The first two draw downs under this letter agreement may not exceed $2 million. Thereafter, the draw down amounts will depend on the average daily trading volume of our shares.\nWe have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect. In addition, the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress in clinical trials is uncertain. Because our product candidates are in clinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts that will be necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the timing, progress and results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH, PH-COPD and PH-IPF;\n\u00b7 our ability to manufacture sufficient supply of our product candidates and the costs thereof;\n\u00b7 discussions with regulatory agencies regarding the design and conduct of our clinical trials and the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7 the number and development requirements of any other product candidates we pursue;\n\u00b7 our ability to enter into collaborative agreements and achieve milestones under those agreements;\n\u00b7 the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\u00b7 our expenses as a stand-alone company; and\n\u00b7 the extent to which we acquire or in-license other products and technologies.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity and debt offerings, existing working capital and funding from potential future collaboration arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences or rights such as anti-dilution rights that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $46.3 million compared to $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $24.3 million, or 34%. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to reduced research and development expenses and the recognition in the year ended December 31, 2014 of the $10.8 million restricted cash balance related to the escrow payment due to Ikaria, which was utilized to pay Ikaria during 2015, offset in part by a $6.6 million prepayment made to Ikaria as part of amending our drug supply agreement and an $8.0 million prepayment made to the clinical research organization we have partnered with for the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials for INOpulse for PAH.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $70.6 million compared to $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $13.4 million, or 23%. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the deposit of escrowed cash in connection with the TSA.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $18.3 million, including $0.5 million for capital expenditures related to our new office space in Warren, New Jersey and $22.7 million for the purchase of marketable securities, offset by $4.9 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. There were no cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.7 million of capital expenditures.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $54.0 million compared to $87.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $33.4 million, or 38%. The decrease resulted from the difference between the $53.8 million net proceeds from our IPO in the year ended December 31, 2015, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $4.2 million and offering costs of $2.0 million paid, compared to the $89.3 million net investment by Ikaria, primarily due to a cash contribution of $80.0 million from Ikaria in the year ended December 31, 2014 in connection with the Spin-Out.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $87.4 million compared to $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $29.4 million, or 51%. The increase was primarily due to a cash contribution of $80.0 million from Ikaria in connection with the Spin-Out.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following is a summary of our long-term contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Operating lease obligations include the lease agreement we entered into on August 6, 2015 for office space in Warren, New Jersey and our lease of an operating facility located in North Brunswick, New Jersey. \n(2) On March 25, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Flextronics to manufacture and service the INOpulse devices that we expect to use in future clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD. Under the agreement, we have committed to purchase devices.\nRoyalty payments and success-based milestones associated with our license and supply agreements with Ikaria and have not been included in the above table of contractual obligations as we cannot reasonably estimate if or when they will occur.\nWe do not intend to proceed with further clinical development of BCM until and unless we can determine an alternative path forward. Consequently, any future royalty and milestones payments to BioLine would depend on finding a path forward for future clinical development. Under the terms of the license agreement, if we achieve certain clinical and regulatory events specified in the license agreement, we will be obligated to pay milestone payments to BioLine, which could total, in the aggregate, up to $115.5 million, and if we achieve certain commercialization targets specified in the license agreement, we will be obligated to pay additional milestone payments to BioLine, which could total, in the aggregate, up to $150.0 million. In addition, we will be obligated to pay BioLine a specified percentage of any upfront consideration we receive for sublicensing BCM, as well as royalties on net sales, if any, at a percentage ranging from 11% to 15%, depending on net sales level, of any approved product containing BCM, subject to offsets for specified payments to third parties made in connection with BCM. We have reimbursed BioLine for certain legal fees in the amount of $250,000 following completion of our IPO.\nIn the course of our normal business operations, we also enter into agreements with contract service providers and others to assist in the performance of our research and development and manufacturing activities. We can elect to discontinue the work under these contracts and purchase orders at any time with notice, and such contracts and purchase orders do not contain minimum purchase obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to research and development expense, impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary research and development efforts, as well as costs incurred in connection with certain licensing arrangements. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties upon or subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. We also expense the cost of purchased technology and equipment in the period of purchase if we believe that the technology or equipment has not demonstrated technological feasibility and does not have an alternative future use. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and are recognized as research and development expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate a portion of our accrued research expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We make such estimates of our incurred research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include:\n\u00b7 fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials;\n\u00b7 fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials; and\n\u00b7 fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials.\nWe base our expenses related to research and development and clinical trials on actual costs incurred in addition to our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple third parties, including research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing the research and development service fees, we consider the terms of each agreement, the time period over which the services will be performed and the level of effort required to complete the service. If the actual timing of the performance of the services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe issue, and prior to the Spin-Out Ikaria, our former parent, issued, stock-based awards to employees and non-employees in the form of stock options, restricted stock awards, or RSAs, and restricted stock units, or RSUs. The stock-based compensation expense recorded for the periods prior to the Spin-Out presented in our audited financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, represents an allocation of Ikaria's stock-based compensation expense based on the allocation percentages of our cost centers, which were determined based on specific identification or the proportionate percentage of employee time or headcount to the respective total Ikaria employee time or headcount. Because certain of these amounts relate to Ikaria stock-based awards, the amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily reflect the stock-based compensation or compensation expense that we would have experienced as a stand-alone company for these periods.\nWe account for our stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 718 Compensation- Stock Compensation, which establishes accounting for share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock, exchanged for services and requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of these awards over the requisite service period. We recognize stock-based compensation expense in operations based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant. The resulting compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period or sooner if the awards immediately vest.\nDetermining the appropriate fair value of stock-based awards requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our units and, for options, the expected term of the option and expected volatility. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value our stock option awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management's best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and management uses different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different for future awards. The expected term of stock options is estimated using the simplified method,\u201d as we have no historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior for our stock options grants. The simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant. For volatility, we use comparable public companies as a basis for our expected volatility to calculate the fair value of option grants due to our limited history as a public company. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected term of the option. For restricted stock, the fair value is the closing market price per share on the grant date. The estimation of the number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period in which estimates are revised.\nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of options issued during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $6.55 and $9.98, respectively. The following are the weighted average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of options issued during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\nFor the period presented prior to the Spin-Out, the weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors of Ikaria and the weighted average assumptions used by Ikaria to estimate the grant date fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model were:\n\nThere were no Ikaria options issued during the period from January 1, 2014 through February 11, 2014.\nIkaria has historically granted its stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair value of its common stock. Ikaria was a private company with no active public market for its common stock. Therefore, its board of directors periodically determined for financial reporting purposes the estimated fair value of its common stock using valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation , also known as the Practice Aid.\nThe compensation expense for the RSUs was based on the grant date fair value of the RSU, which was based on the fair value of the underlying stock.\nIn February 2014, prior to the Spin-Out, each Ikaria stock option, other than options held by non-accredited investors who were also not employees of Ikaria, was adjusted such that it became an option to acquire the same number of shares of Ikaria non-voting common stock as were subject to the Ikaria stock option, or an Adjusted Ikaria Option, and an option to acquire the same number of our non-voting limited liability company units as the number of shares of Ikaria non-voting common stock that were subject to the Ikaria stock option, or a Bellerophon Option. There were 618,212 Bellerophon Options issued as a result of the adjustment of Ikaria stock options. The vesting of each Adjusted Ikaria Option and Bellerophon Option was fully accelerated on the date of the Spin-Out and all related compensation expense was recognized as an expense by Ikaria.\nPrior to and in connection with the Spin-Out, the exercise price of each Adjusted Ikaria Option and Bellerophon Option was adjusted by allocating the relative post Spin-Out estimated fair values of Ikaria and us in a ratio of 85% and 15%, respectively, to the original Ikaria option exercise price. The expiration date of the options was not modified.\nOn June 20, 2014, following the Spin-Out, we granted options to purchase 514,266 of our non-voting units with an exercise price of $13.28 per non-voting unit. As we were a private company with no active public market for our equity securities at the time, the estimated fair value of one of our non-voting units as of June 20, 2014, was determined by our board of directors to be $13.28. In making this determination, our board of directors used a contemporaneous valuation based on the income approach, performed in accordance with the guidance enumerated in the Practice Aid. For the income approach, we used the discounted cash flow method to estimate the present value of the future monetary benefits expected to flow to the owners of the business. The contemporaneous valuation also considered factors enumerated in Revenue Ruling 59-60, which serves as a general guideline for the valuation of closely held securities. In addition, we considered all objective and subjective factors that we believe to be relevant to such valuation, including our best estimate of our business condition, prospects and operating performance at the valuation date. Within the contemporaneous valuation performed, a range of factors and assumptions were used. The significant factors, many of them complex and highly subjective, included:\n\u00b7 estimates of our future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate;\n\u00b7 the nature and history of our business enterprise;\n\u00b7 the assessment of key value drivers for our business enterprise;\n\u00b7 the economic outlook in general and the condition and outlook of our industry in particular;\n\u00b7 the financial condition of our business and the book value of our equity interests;\n\u00b7 the likelihood of our achieving a liquidity event; and\n\u00b7 prior sales of equity interests of companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business that have their stocks actively traded in a free and open market.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we adopted the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2014 Plan, which provides for the grant of options. Following the effectiveness of our registration statement filed in connection with our IPO, no options may be granted under the 2014 Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we adopted the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2015 Plan, which provides for the grant of options, restricted stock and other forms of equity compensation.\nSince our IPO, the exercise price per share of all option grants has been set at the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on the applicable date of grant.\nThe compensation expense for the RSAs was based on the grant date fair value of the RSA, which was based on the fair value of the underlying stock.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded stock-based expenses as follows:\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d. This guidance clarifies that an entity's management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and annual and interim periods thereafter, and early application is permitted. We are assessing ASU 2014-15's impact and will adopt it when effective.\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are assessing ASU 2014-09's impact and will adopt it when effective.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases\", which is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This standard requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by lease terms of more than 12 months. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) December 31, 2020; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the first day of the year following the first year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u00b7 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u00b7 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In particular, we have not included all of the executive compensation information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on certain or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nBusiness\nWe are a clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on developing innovative products at the intersection of drugs and devices that address significant unmet medical needs in the treatment of cardiopulmonary diseases. The focus of our clinical program is the continued development of our nitric oxide therapy for patients with pulmonary hypertension, or PH, using our proprietary delivery system, INOpulse, with pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, representing the lead indication. Our INOpulse program is based on our proprietary pulsatile nitric oxide delivery device.\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH in October 2014, which is Part 1 of the trial. In February 2016, we announced positive data from the final analysis of our Phase 2 long-term extension clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which is Part 2 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH. The data reinforces the results from October 2014 and indicates a sustainability of benefit to PAH patients who received INOpulse therapy. After reaching agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, on our Phase 3 protocol, we are moving forward with Phase 3 development. In September 2015, the FDA issued a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, for our Phase 3 PAH program for INOpulse, which will include two confirmatory clinical trials, undertaken either sequentially or in parallel, with the first patient expected to be enrolled during the first half of 2016.\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-confirmation Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PH-COPD in July 2014. We have received results from this trial, and we are planning further Phase 2 testing to demonstrate the potential benefit on exercise capacity. In September 2015, an oral presentation of late-breaking data from a clinical trial sponsored by us was presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress 2015 in Amsterdam. The data showed that INOpulse improved vasodilation in patients with PH-COPD. We plan to build upon this and other work we have done over recent quarters to continue Phase 2 testing for the use of the INOpulse device for PH-COPD patients.\nWe are planning to undertake clinical testing of the INOpulse therapy to treat PH associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or PH-IPF, based on feedback from the medical community and the large unmet medical need for this condition. In addition, other opportunities for the application of our INOpulse program include the following indications: chronic thromboembolic PH, or CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness.\nWe presented detailed results from the PRESERVATION I trial for our Bioabsorbable Cardiac Matrix, or BCM, program at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in London on September 1, 2015. Following the results, we are considering further exploratory work but we do not intend to proceed with further clinical development of BCM at this point until and unless we can determine an alternative path forward.\nWe have devoted all of our resources to our therapeutic discovery and development efforts, including conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and the general and administrative support of these operations. We have devoted significant time and resources to developing and optimizing our drug delivery system, INOpulse, which operates through the administration of nitric oxide as brief, controlled pulses that are timed to occur at the beginning of a breath. In addition, in prior quarters, we had incurred significant costs to scale up manufacturing of BCM to support our clinical trials.\nTo date, we have generated no revenue from product sales. We expect that it will be several years before we commercialize a product candidate, if ever.\nRestructuring\nFollowing the results of our PRESERVATION I clinical trial for BCM, on September 11, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a staff reduction plan in order to reduce operating expenses and conserve cash resources, which we refer to as the Restructuring. The Restructuring included a workforce reduction of approximately 20 people completed in 2015. We offered severance benefits to the affected employees, including cash severance payments. Each affected employee's eligibility for the severance benefits was contingent upon such employee's execution (and non-revocation) of a separation agreement, which included a general release of claims against us. We recorded pre-tax charges of $1.4 million associated with the Restructuring, primarily consisting of the cash severance payments specified above. These charges were incurred largely in the third quarter of 2015 and are anticipated to be paid out in cash by March 2017.\nSeparation and Spin-Out from Ikaria\nPrior to February 2014, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ikaria, Inc. (a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt plc), or Ikaria. As part of an internal reorganization of Ikaria in October 2013, Ikaria transferred to us exclusive worldwide rights, with no royalty obligations, to develop and commercialize pulsed nitric oxide in PAH, PH-COPD and PH-IPF. In November 2015, we entered into an amendment to our exclusive cross-license, technology transfer and regulatory matters agreement with Ikaria that included a royalty equal to 3% of net sales of any commercial products for PAH. Following the internal reorganization, in February 2014, Ikaria distributed all of our then outstanding units to its stockholders through the payment of a special dividend on a pro rata basis based on each stockholder's ownership of Ikaria capital stock, which we refer to as the Spin-Out, and as a result we became a stand-alone company.\nOur inception date is August 26, 2009, which is the date that BCM was licensed to us by BioLineRx Ltd. and BioLine Innovations Jerusalem L.P., which we refer to collectively as BioLine. Our operations since that date have included organization and staffing, business planning, in-licensing technology, developing product candidates in clinical programs, evaluating potential future product candidates, as well as undertaking pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates.\nIn February 2014 and July 2015, we entered into a transition services agreement and an amendment to the transition services agreement, respectively, with Ikaria, which we refer to as the TSA. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the TSA, Ikaria agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide certain services to us until February 2016, the termination of which was accelerated to September 30, 2015 as part of the amendment, subject to the terms of the TSA. In exchange for the services provided by Ikaria pursuant to the TSA, we paid to Ikaria a service fee in the amount of $772,000 per month and reimbursed Ikaria for any out of pocket expenses, any taxes imposed on Ikaria in connection with the provision of services under the TSA.\nUnder our additional services agreement with Ikaria, or the 2015 Services Agreement, which became effective on January 1, 2015, Ikaria provided to us certain information technology and device maintenance services. In exchange for the services provided by Ikaria pursuant to the 2015 Services Agreement, we paid to Ikaria fees that totaled, in the aggregate, approximately $200,000. In July 2015, we entered into an amendment to the 2015 Services Agreement advancing the termination date from February 8, 2016 to September 30, 2015. Additionally, pursuant to the 2015 Services Agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide certain services to Ikaria, including services related to regulatory matters, drug and device safety, clinical operations, biometrics and scientific affairs. We also received payments of $1.7 million from Ikaria in connection with the 2015 Services Agreement.\nAccounting for the Separation and Spin-Out\nOur historical financial statements for periods prior to February 12, 2014, the date of the Spin-Out, discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations were derived from the audited historical financial statements and accounting records of Ikaria and include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs attributable to the research and development segment of Ikaria. In particular, for the period January 1, 2014 to February 11, 2014, our financial statements include expense allocations for (1) certain corporate functions historically provided by Ikaria, including finance, audit, legal, information technology and human resources services, (2) research and development expenses and (3) stock-based compensation. These allocations are based on either specific identification or allocation methods such as time and wage studies, headcount or other measures determined by us. Management believes that the statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the period of time prior to the Spin-Out includes a reasonable allocation of costs and expenses incurred by Ikaria from which we benefited. See Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDue to this presentation, the financial information for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not reflect what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows will be in the future or what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been in the past had we been a public, stand-alone company throughout the periods presented.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and may not generate any revenue from product sales for the next several years, if ever. In the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, license fees and milestone payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and royalties from the sale of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends primarily on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize or partner our product candidates as well as any product candidates we may advance in the future. We expect that any revenue we may generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of any payments we may receive under future partnerships, if any, and from sales of any products we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. If we fail to complete the development of any of our product candidates currently in clinical development or any future product candidates in a timely manner, or to obtain regulatory approval for such product candidates, our ability to generate future revenue, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates, including upfront and development milestone payments, related to in-licensed product candidates and technologies.\nIn order to fairly present our historical information for periods prior to the Spin-Out, certain departmental expenses from Ikaria have been allocated to us. The allocations were applied to us for the purpose of presenting our company as a stand-alone entity. Direct and indirect costs for periods prior to the Spin-Out related to the INOpulse and BCM clinical programs have been allocated to us. All allocations were based on actual costs incurred. For purposes of allocating non-project specific expenses, each Ikaria department head provided information as to the percentage of employee time incurred on our behalf.\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of:\n\u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salary, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and consultants that conduct a portion of our pre-clinical studies;\n\u00b7 expenses relating to vendors in connection with research and development activities;\n\u00b7 the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials;\n\u00b7 facilities, depreciation of fixed assets and allocated expenses;\n\u00b7 lab supplies, reagents, active pharmaceutical ingredients and other direct and indirect costs in support of our pre-clinical and clinical activities;\n\u00b7 device development and drug manufacturing engineering;\n\u00b7 license fees related to in-licensed products and technology; and\n\u00b7 costs associated with non-clinical activities and regulatory approvals.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred.\nConducting a significant amount of research and development is central to our business model. Product candidates in late stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development primarily due to the increased size and duration of late-stage clinical trials. Subject to the availability of requisite financing, we\nplan to increase our research and development expenses for ongoing clinical programs for the foreseeable future as we seek to continue multiple clinical trials for our product candidates, including to potentially advance INOpulse for PH-IPF, and seek to identify additional early-stage product candidates.\nWe track external research and development expenses and personnel expenses on a program-by-program basis. We use our employee and infrastructure resources, including regulatory, quality, clinical development and clinical operations, across our clinical development programs and have included these expenses in research and development infrastructure. Research and development laboratory expenses are also not allocated to a specific program and are included in research and development infrastructure. Engineering activities related to INOpulse and the manufacture of cylinders related to INOpulse are included in INOpulse engineering.\nINOpulse for PAH\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH in October 2014. The goal of the trial was to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two different doses of INOpulse for PAH. In February 2016, we performed the final analysis of our Phase 2 long-term extension clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which is Part 2 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which reinforced the results from Part 1 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH. After reaching agreement with the FDA and the EMA on our Phase 3 protocol, we are moving forward with Phase 3 development.\nINOpulse for PH-COPD\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-confirmation Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PH-COPD in July 2014. We have received results from this trial, and we are planning further Phase 2 testing in 2016 to demonstrate the potential benefit of INOpulse on exercise capacity.\nINOpulse for PH-IPF\nWe also plan to initiate our Phase 2 studies in PH-IPF in 2016 consisting of an exploratory acute hemodynamic study followed by exercise capacity.\nBCM\nWe initiated a clinical trial of BCM, which we refer to as our PRESERVATION I trial, in December 2011, enrolled the first patient in April 2012 and completed enrollment in December 2014. Top-line results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial were announced in July 2015. From a safety perspective we observed no significant difference in adverse events rates between patients in the BCM and placebo treatment groups. However, the data showed no statistically significant treatment differences between patients treated with BCM and patients treated with placebo for both the primary and secondary endpoints in the trial. We presented detailed results from the PRESERVATION I trial for our BCM program at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in London on September 1, 2015. Following the results, we are considering further exploratory work but we do not intend to proceed with further clinical development of BCM at this point until and unless we can determine an alternative path forward.\nResearch and Development Infrastructure\nWe invest in regulatory, quality, clinical development and clinical operations activities, which are expensed as incurred. These activities primarily support our clinical development programs.\nINOpulse Engineering\nWe have invested a significant amount of funds in INOpulse, which is configured to be highly portable and compatible with available modes of long-term oxygen therapy via nasal cannula delivery. Our Phase 2 clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD utilized the first generation INOpulse DS device. We believe our second generation INOpulse device, as well as a custom triple-lumen cannula, will significantly improve several characteristics of our INOpulse delivery system. We have also invested in design and engineering technology, through Ikaria, for the manufacture of our drug cartridges. In February 2015, we entered into an agreement with Flextronics Medical Sales and Marketing Ltd., a subsidiary of Flextronics International Ltd., or Flextronics, to manufacture and service the INOpulse devices that we will use in future clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD and PH-IPF.\nIt is difficult to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of our current or any future pre-clinical programs and any of our current or future clinical trials and any future product candidates we may advance, or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of any future clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate and significant and changing government regulation. In addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could change significantly the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time with respect to the development of that product candidate. We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, as well as an assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential, including the likelihood of regulatory approval on a timely basis.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and costs related to executive, finance, business development, marketing, legal and human resources functions, either through direct expenses or the TSA. Other general and administrative expenses include patent filing, patent prosecution, professional fees for legal, insurance, consulting, information technology and auditing and tax services not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe believe that the following factors, among others, will affect the amount of our general and administrative expenses in the future:\n\u00b7 we expect to incur reduced general and administrative expenses following the completion of the Restructuring;\n\u00b7 we expect to incur reduced general and administrative expenses previously paid to Ikaria following the expiration of the TSA and the 2015 Services Agreement, in each case on September 30, 2015; and\n\u00b7 we expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses to replace services previously provided to us by Ikaria under the TSA such as accounting and financial management support, human resources support, drug and device safety services, biometrics support, information technology services and manufacturing and device servicing support.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, together with the changes in these items in dollars and as a percentage.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BCM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,506\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PAH\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(641\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PH-COPD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,054\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clinical programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,111\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INOpulse engineering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,667\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,667\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n.a.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,568\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59,753\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss and comprehensive loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46,459\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(59,674\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $48.2 million compared to $59.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $11.6 million, or 19%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in research and development expenses pertaining to our BCM and INOpulse for PH-COPD programs and to a decrease in research and development infrastructure expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Total research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $33.4 million compared to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $12.6 million, or 27%. Total research and development expenses consisted of the following:\n\u00b7 BCM research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $8.2 million compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $5.5 million, or 40%. The decrease was primarily due to us ceasing further clinical development of BCM following the PRESERVATION I results.\n\u00b7 PAH research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $10.7 million compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 6%. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial in late-2014 and a reversal of an accrual in the year ended December 31, 2015 partially offset by increased costs in anticipation of the start of the Phase 3 clinical trials.\n\u00b7 PH-COPD research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $0.0 million compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 100%. The decrease primarily resulted from the completion of the Phase 2a clinical trial in mid-2014.\n\u00b7 Research and development infrastructure expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $8.6 million compared to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $3.1 million, or 27%. The decrease was due to reductions in infrastructure spending to support our INOpulse and BCM clinical programs and the discontinuance of cash bonuses. In September 2015, we decided to pay 2015 bonuses by granting employees restricted stock awards which will vest over a one-year period from the date of grant. Accordingly, the related cost will be recognized over such period.\n\u00b7 INOpulse engineering expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $6.0 million compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 5%.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $14.9 million compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.1 million, or 8%. The increase was primarily due to restructuring charges of $1.1 million and additional costs of operating as a public company, including expenses related to transition services from Ikaria and other professional services offset, in part, by the discontinuance of cash bonuses. In September 2015, we decided to pay 2015 bonuses by granting employees restricted stock awards which will vest over a one-year period from the date of grant. Accordingly, the related cost will be recognized over such period.\nOther Operating Income. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.7 million, and we had no operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase resulted from payments received from Ikaria in connection with entering into the 2015 Services Agreement.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, together with the changes in these items in dollars and as a percentage.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BCM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,606\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PAH\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PH-COPD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,394\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clinical programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,780\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,325\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INOpulse engineering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,007\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n.a.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss and comprehensive loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(59,674\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(61,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $59.8 million compared to $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 4%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in research and development expenses pertaining to our BCM and INOpulse for PH-COPD programs and to decreased research and development infrastructure expenses, partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses pertaining to INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse engineering expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Total research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $46.0 million compared to $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $7.0 million, or 13%. Total research and development expenses consisted of the following:\n\u00b7 BCM research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $13.7 million compared to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 21%. The decrease primarily resulted from the effect of certain non-recurring manufacturing costs in the 2013 period, as well as a decrease in the pre-clinical activities that we conducted with respect to BCM during the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in clinical trial costs as a result of an increase in patient enrollments in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year period.\n\u00b7 PAH research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $11.3 million compared to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $3.2 million, or 40%. The increase was primarily due to higher clinical trial expenses in the year ended December 31, 2014, driven by higher patient enrollment costs as compared to the prior year period, as well as increased spending in respect of development of the INOpulse device in preparation for our anticipated Phase 3 clinical trial.\n\u00b7 PH-COPD research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $3.0 million compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $5.4 million, or 64%. The decrease primarily resulted from lower dosing trial costs as a result of the completion of our Phase 2 clinical trial.\n\u00b7 Research and development infrastructure expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $11.7 million compared to $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 17%. The decrease was primarily the result of reductions in headcount in connection with managing staffing needs to support our INOpulse and BCM clinical programs.\n\u00b7 INOpulse engineering expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $6.3 million compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $1.1 million, or 21%. The increase was primarily due to increases in development costs as we transitioned from the INOpulse DS device to the newer INOpulse device.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $13.8 million compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $4.8 million, or 53%. The increase was primarily due to the incremental costs of operating as a stand-alone entity, including professional service fees, executive search costs, the payment of certain retention bonuses and information technology expenditures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn the course of our development activities, we have sustained operating losses and expect such losses to continue over the next several years.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 million and marketable securities of $17.8 million as of December 31, 2015. We received net proceeds of $51.9 million in February 2015 as a result of the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $4.2 million and offering costs of $3.9 million.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, third-party clinical research and development services, contract manufacturing services, laboratory and related supplies, clinical costs, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs.\nIf we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses. We do not currently have the infrastructure for the sale, marketing, manufacture or distribution of any products. To develop a commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to having any certainty of marketing approval.\nOur existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $24.1 million as of December 31, 2015 will be used primarily to fund the first of two INOpulse for PAH Phase 3 trials, in which we expect to enroll the first patient in the first half of 2016. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had $11.3 million prepayments of research and development expenses related to our amended drug supply agreement with Ikaria and the clinical research organization we have partnered with for the first of the two Phase 3 clinical trials for INOpulse for PAH. We believe, as of December 31, 2015, we have sufficient funds to satisfy our operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months due in part to the Restructuring and other cost saving initiatives.\nWe expect these funds, combined with additional funding anticipated from Global Corporate Finance, or GCF, will be sufficient to complete the first of two PAH Phase 3 trials. During December 2015, we entered into a letter agreement with GCF. In accordance with the terms of the letter agreement, we have agreed to place with GCF up $20 million of our common stock subject to the execution of a definitive share purchase agreement and registration rights agreement. We may not draw down amounts that would result in GCF owning more than 19.9% of our outstanding shares. The first two draw downs under this letter agreement may not exceed $2 million. Thereafter, the draw down amounts will depend on the average daily trading volume of our shares.\nWe have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect. In addition, the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress in clinical trials is uncertain. Because our product candidates are in clinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts that will be necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the timing, progress and results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH, PH-COPD and PH-IPF;\n\u00b7 our ability to manufacture sufficient supply of our product candidates and the costs thereof;\n\u00b7 discussions with regulatory agencies regarding the design and conduct of our clinical trials and the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7 the number and development requirements of any other product candidates we pursue;\n\u00b7 our ability to enter into collaborative agreements and achieve milestones under those agreements;\n\u00b7 the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\u00b7 our expenses as a stand-alone company; and\n\u00b7 the extent to which we acquire or in-license other products and technologies.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity and debt offerings, existing working capital and funding from potential future collaboration arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences or rights such as anti-dilution rights that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46,264\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(70,562\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57,231\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,305\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(727\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,555\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $46.3 million compared to $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $24.3 million, or 34%. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to reduced research and development expenses and the recognition in the year ended December 31, 2014 of the $10.8 million restricted cash balance related to the escrow payment due to Ikaria, which was utilized to pay Ikaria during 2015, offset in part by a $6.6 million prepayment made to Ikaria as part of amending our drug supply agreement and an $8.0 million prepayment made to the clinical research organization we have partnered with for the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials for INOpulse for PAH.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $70.6 million compared to $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $13.4 million, or 23%. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the deposit of escrowed cash in connection with the TSA.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $18.3 million, including $0.5 million for capital expenditures related to our new office space in Warren, New Jersey and $22.7 million for the purchase of marketable securities, offset by $4.9 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. There were no cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.7 million of capital expenditures.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $54.0 million compared to $87.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $33.4 million, or 38%. The decrease resulted from the difference between the $53.8 million net proceeds from our IPO in the year ended December 31, 2015, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $4.2 million and offering costs of $2.0 million paid, compared to the $89.3 million net investment by Ikaria, primarily due to a cash contribution of $80.0 million from Ikaria in the year ended December 31, 2014 in connection with the Spin-Out.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $87.4 million compared to $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $29.4 million, or 51%. The increase was primarily due to a cash contribution of $80.0 million from Ikaria in connection with the Spin-Out.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following is a summary of our long-term contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period ($)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flextronics Agreement(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Operating lease obligations include the lease agreement we entered into on August 6, 2015 for office space in Warren, New Jersey and our lease of an operating facility located in North Brunswick, New Jersey. \n(2) On March 25, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Flextronics to manufacture and service the INOpulse devices that we expect to use in future clinical trials of INOpulse for PAH and INOpulse for PH-COPD. Under the agreement, we have committed to purchase devices.\nRoyalty payments and success-based milestones associated with our license and supply agreements with Ikaria and have not been included in the above table of contractual obligations as we cannot reasonably estimate if or when they will occur.\nWe do not intend to proceed with further clinical development of BCM until and unless we can determine an alternative path forward. Consequently, any future royalty and milestones payments to BioLine would depend on finding a path forward for future clinical development. Under the terms of the license agreement, if we achieve certain clinical and regulatory events specified in the license agreement, we will be obligated to pay milestone payments to BioLine, which could total, in the aggregate, up to $115.5 million, and if we achieve certain commercialization targets specified in the license agreement, we will be obligated to pay additional milestone payments to BioLine, which could total, in the aggregate, up to $150.0 million. In addition, we will be obligated to pay BioLine a specified percentage of any upfront consideration we receive for sublicensing BCM, as well as royalties on net sales, if any, at a percentage ranging from 11% to 15%, depending on net sales level, of any approved product containing BCM, subject to offsets for specified payments to third parties made in connection with BCM. We have reimbursed BioLine for certain legal fees in the amount of $250,000 following completion of our IPO.\nIn the course of our normal business operations, we also enter into agreements with contract service providers and others to assist in the performance of our research and development and manufacturing activities. We can elect to discontinue the work under these contracts and purchase orders at any time with notice, and such contracts and purchase orders do not contain minimum purchase obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to research and development expense, impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary research and development efforts, as well as costs incurred in connection with certain licensing arrangements. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties upon or subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. We also expense the cost of purchased technology and equipment in the period of purchase if we believe that the technology or equipment has not demonstrated technological feasibility and does not have an alternative future use. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and are recognized as research and development expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate a portion of our accrued research expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We make such estimates of our incurred research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include:\n\u00b7 fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials;\n\u00b7 fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials; and\n\u00b7 fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials.\nWe base our expenses related to research and development and clinical trials on actual costs incurred in addition to our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple third parties, including research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing the research and development service fees, we consider the terms of each agreement, the time period over which the services will be performed and the level of effort required to complete the service. If the actual timing of the performance of the services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe issue, and prior to the Spin-Out Ikaria, our former parent, issued, stock-based awards to employees and non-employees in the form of stock options, restricted stock awards, or RSAs, and restricted stock units, or RSUs. The stock-based compensation expense recorded for the periods prior to the Spin-Out presented in our audited financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, represents an allocation of Ikaria's stock-based compensation expense based on the allocation percentages of our cost centers, which were determined based on specific identification or the proportionate percentage of employee time or headcount to the respective total Ikaria employee time or headcount. Because certain of these amounts relate to Ikaria stock-based awards, the amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily reflect the stock-based compensation or compensation expense that we would have experienced as a stand-alone company for these periods.\nWe account for our stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 718 Compensation- Stock Compensation, which establishes accounting for share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock, exchanged for services and requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of these awards over the requisite service period. We recognize stock-based compensation expense in operations based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant. The resulting compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period or sooner if the awards immediately vest.\nDetermining the appropriate fair value of stock-based awards requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our units and, for options, the expected term of the option and expected volatility. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value our stock option awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management's best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and management uses different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different for future awards. The expected term of stock options is estimated using the simplified method,\u201d as we have no historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior for our stock options grants. The simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant. For volatility, we use comparable public companies as a basis for our expected volatility to calculate the fair value of option grants due to our limited history as a public company. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected term of the option. For restricted stock, the fair value is the closing market price per share on the grant date. The estimation of the number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period in which estimates are revised.\nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of options issued during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $6.55 and $9.98, respectively. The following are the weighted average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of options issued during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>1.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected volatility\n</td> <td>79.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>90.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend yield\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the period presented prior to the Spin-Out, the weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors of Ikaria and the weighted average assumptions used by Ikaria to estimate the grant date fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model were:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average grant date fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>0.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected volatility\n</td> <td>46.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere were no Ikaria options issued during the period from January 1, 2014 through February 11, 2014.\nIkaria has historically granted its stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair value of its common stock. Ikaria was a private company with no active public market for its common stock. Therefore, its board of directors periodically determined for financial reporting purposes the estimated fair value of its common stock using valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation , also known as the Practice Aid.\nThe compensation expense for the RSUs was based on the grant date fair value of the RSU, which was based on the fair value of the underlying stock.\nIn February 2014, prior to the Spin-Out, each Ikaria stock option, other than options held by non-accredited investors who were also not employees of Ikaria, was adjusted such that it became an option to acquire the same number of shares of Ikaria non-voting common stock as were subject to the Ikaria stock option, or an Adjusted Ikaria Option, and an option to acquire the same number of our non-voting limited liability company units as the number of shares of Ikaria non-voting common stock that were subject to the Ikaria stock option, or a Bellerophon Option. There were 618,212 Bellerophon Options issued as a result of the adjustment of Ikaria stock options. The vesting of each Adjusted Ikaria Option and Bellerophon Option was fully accelerated on the date of the Spin-Out and all related compensation expense was recognized as an expense by Ikaria.\nPrior to and in connection with the Spin-Out, the exercise price of each Adjusted Ikaria Option and Bellerophon Option was adjusted by allocating the relative post Spin-Out estimated fair values of Ikaria and us in a ratio of 85% and 15%, respectively, to the original Ikaria option exercise price. The expiration date of the options was not modified.\nOn June 20, 2014, following the Spin-Out, we granted options to purchase 514,266 of our non-voting units with an exercise price of $13.28 per non-voting unit. As we were a private company with no active public market for our equity securities at the time, the estimated fair value of one of our non-voting units as of June 20, 2014, was determined by our board of directors to be $13.28. In making this determination, our board of directors used a contemporaneous valuation based on the income approach, performed in accordance with the guidance enumerated in the Practice Aid. For the income approach, we used the discounted cash flow method to estimate the present value of the future monetary benefits expected to flow to the owners of the business. The contemporaneous valuation also considered factors enumerated in Revenue Ruling 59-60, which serves as a general guideline for the valuation of closely held securities. In addition, we considered all objective and subjective factors that we believe to be relevant to such valuation, including our best estimate of our business condition, prospects and operating performance at the valuation date. Within the contemporaneous valuation performed, a range of factors and assumptions were used. The significant factors, many of them complex and highly subjective, included:\n\u00b7 estimates of our future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate;\n\u00b7 the nature and history of our business enterprise;\n\u00b7 the assessment of key value drivers for our business enterprise;\n\u00b7 the economic outlook in general and the condition and outlook of our industry in particular;\n\u00b7 the financial condition of our business and the book value of our equity interests;\n\u00b7 the likelihood of our achieving a liquidity event; and\n\u00b7 prior sales of equity interests of companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business that have their stocks actively traded in a free and open market.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we adopted the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2014 Plan, which provides for the grant of options. Following the effectiveness of our registration statement filed in connection with our IPO, no options may be granted under the 2014 Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we adopted the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2015 Plan, which provides for the grant of options, restricted stock and other forms of equity compensation.\nSince our IPO, the exercise price per share of all option grants has been set at the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on the applicable date of grant.\nThe compensation expense for the RSAs was based on the grant date fair value of the RSA, which was based on the fair value of the underlying stock.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded stock-based expenses as follows:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d. This guidance clarifies that an entity's management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and annual and interim periods thereafter, and early application is permitted. We are assessing ASU 2014-15's impact and will adopt it when effective.\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are assessing ASU 2014-09's impact and will adopt it when effective.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases\", which is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This standard requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by lease terms of more than 12 months. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) December 31, 2020; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the first day of the year following the first year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u00b7 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u00b7 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In particular, we have not included all of the executive compensation information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on certain or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those"}
