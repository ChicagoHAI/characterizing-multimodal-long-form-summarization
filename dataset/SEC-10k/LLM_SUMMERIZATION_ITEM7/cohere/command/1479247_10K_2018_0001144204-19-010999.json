Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of the Trust included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Trust's actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe the Trust's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d intend\u201d or project,\u201d the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and the Trust cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. The Trust's actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.\nThe Trust has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and the Trust assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although the Trust undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that the Trust may make directly to them or through reports that the Trust in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nIntroduction\nEach Trust Series is a commodity pool that issues shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in such Trust Series that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. The Trust Series are series of the Trust, a Delaware statutory trust formed on December 21, 2009.\nUnited States Commodity Index Fund\nUSCI invests in futures contracts for commodities that are traded on the Futures Exchanges and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, Other Commodity-Related Investments. Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USCI to invest in Other Commodity Related Investments would be those allowing USCI to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.\nThe investment objective of USCI is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SDCI, plus interest earned on USCI's collateral holdings, less USCI's expenses. USCF does not intend to operate USCI in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts (as defined below) that comprise the SDCI or the prices of any particular group of Futures Contracts. USCI will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. USCI believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments. The SDCI is designed to reflect the performance of a diversified group of commodities. The SDCI is comprised of 14 Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis from a list of 27 possible Futures Contracts. The Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SDCI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Futures Contracts\u201d. The SDCI is owned and maintained by SummerHaven Index Management, LLC ( SHIM\u201d) and calculated and published by Bloomberg, L.P. ( Bloomberg\u201d). USCI invests first in the current Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other Futures Contracts intended to replicate the return on the current Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and, thereafter may hold Futures Contracts in a particular commodity other than one specified as the Benchmark Component Futures Contract, or may hold Other Commodity-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, but may fail to closely track the SDCI's total return movements.\nUSCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments such that daily changes in its' per share NAV closely track the daily changes in the price of the SDCI. USCI's positions in Commodity Interests are rebalanced on a monthly basis in order to track the changing nature of the SDCI. If Futures Contracts relating to a particular commodity remain in the SDCI from one month to the next, such Futures Contracts are rebalanced to the 7.14% target weight. Specifically, on the Selection Date, it will be determined if a current Benchmark Component Futures Contract will be replaced by a new Futures Contract in either the same or different underlying commodity as a Benchmark Component Futures Contract for the following month, in which case USCI's investments would have to be changed accordingly. In order that USCI's trading does not unduly cause extraordinary market movements, and to make it more difficult for third parties to profit by trading based on market movements that could be expected from changes in the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, USCI's investments typically are not rebalanced entirely on a single day, but rather typically rebalanced over a period of four days. After fulfilling the margin and collateral requirements with respect to its Commodity Interests, USCF invests the remainder of USCI's proceeds from the sale of shares in Treasuries or cash equivalents, and/or merely hold such assets in cash (generally in interest-bearing accounts).\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUSCI's shares began trading on August 10, 2010. As of December 31, 2018, USCI held 2,253 Futures Contracts on the NYMEX, 2,276 Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures, 4,037 Futures Contracts on the CBOT, 1,121 Futures Contracts on the CME, 5,819 Futures Contracts on the LME and 753 Futures Contracts on the COMEX, totaling 16,259 futures contracts.\nUnited States Copper Index Fund\nCPER invests in Futures Contracts for commodities that are traded on the COMEX and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, Other Copper-Related Investments. Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause CPER to invest in Other Copper-Related Investments would be those allowing CPER to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.\nThe investment objective of CPER is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SCI, plus interest earned on CPER's collateral holdings, less CPER's expenses. USCF does not intend to operate CPER in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts (as defined below) that comprise the SCI or the prices of any particular group of Futures Contracts. CPER will not seek to achieve a stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Copper-Related Investments (as defined below). The SCI is designed to reflect the performance of the investment returns from a portfolio of copper futures contracts. The SCI is owned and maintained by SHIM and calculated and published by the NYSE Arca. The SCI is comprised of either two or three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis based on quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the Eligible Copper Futures Contracts developed by SHIM. The Eligible Copper Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SCI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts.\u201d\nCPER's shares began trading on November 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2018, CPER held 174 Futures Contracts on the COMEX.\nUnited States Agriculture Index Fund\nUSAG invested in Futures Contracts for commodities traded on the ICE Futures US, the ICE Futures Canada, the CBOT, the CME and the Kansas City Board of Trade ( KCBT\u201d) and to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, Other Agriculture-Related Investments (as defined below). Market conditions that USCF anticipated could cause USAG to invest in Other Agriculture-Related Investments would be those that allowed USAG to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.\nThe investment objective of USAG was for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Dynamic Agriculture Index Total ReturnSM (the SDAI\u201d), plus interest earned on USAG's collateral holdings, less USAG's expenses. USCF's intention was not to operate USAG in a fashion such that its per share NAV would equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts (as defined below) that comprise the SDAI or the prices of any particular group of Agriculture Futures Contracts. The SDAI is designed to reflect the performance of a diversified group of agricultural commodities. The SDAI is owned and maintained by SHIM and calculated and published by the NYSE Arca comprised of 14 Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis based on quantitative formulas developed by SHIM. The Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SDAI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts.\u201d\nUSAG's shares began trading on April 13, 2012 and ceased trading on September 7, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, USAG had liquidated all its assets and distributed cash pro rata to all remaining shareholders.\nOn August 7, 2018, the Board of Directors of USCF determined that USAG could not continue its business and operations in an economically efficient manner due to USAG's inability to attract sufficient assets, thereby hindering its ability to operate efficiently. On that date, the Board of Directors of USCF also authorized and approved the closing and liquidation of USAG together with a plan of liquidation for USAG. The Trust filed a current report on Form 8-K dated August 8, 2018 with the SEC that included, as an exhibit a press release and the USAG plan of liquidation. USAG also filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC dated August 8, 2018.\nOn September 6, 2018, USAG began the process of liquidating its portfolio. As of the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca on September 6, 2018, USAG ceased accepting orders for Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets from authorized participants. Trading in the shares of USAG on the NYSE Arca was suspended prior to the open of the market on September 7, 2018. On September 7, 2018, the Trust, on behalf of USAG, filed a post-effective amendment to the registration statement with the SEC to terminate the offering of registered and unsold shares of USAG and, thereafter, the NYSE Arca filed a Form 25 to effect the withdrawal of the listings for USAG's shares. The liquidation date for USAG was September 12, 2018 and the proceeds of the liquidation were sent to all remaining shareholders of USAG on or about September 13, 2018.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegulation of Commodity Interests\nThe regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the SEC, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact the Trust Series are discussed in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nCommodity Markets\nCommodity Futures Price Movements\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\nAs measured by the four major diversified commodity indexes listed below, commodity futures prices exhibited a mostly downward trend during the year ended December 31, 2018. The table below compares the total returns of the SDCI to the three major diversified commodity indexes over this time period.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Total ReturnSM ( SDCI\u201d)(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.50 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>S&P GSCI Commodity Index (GSCI\u00ae) Total Return(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.82 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bloomberg Commodity Index Total Return(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.25 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index-Optimum Yield Total ReturnTM(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.18 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>The inception date for the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Total ReturnSM is December 2009. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>Source: Bloomberg </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe value of the SDCI as of January 1, 2018 was $1,364.38. As of December 31, 2018, the value of the SDCI was $1,221.18, down approximately (10.50)% over the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe return of approximately (10.50)% on the SDCI listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts due to the impact of trading costs and other expenses. USCI's per share NAV began the year at $42.48 and ended the year at $37.49 on December 31, 2018, a decrease of approximately (11.75)% over the year.

The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Trust Series' Administrator uses the closing prices on the relevant Futures Exchanges of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts (determined at the earlier of the close of such exchange or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the Futures Exchanges, but calculates or determines the value of all other investments of such Trust Series using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments.\nResults of Operations\nOn July 30, 2010, USCI received a notice of effectiveness from the SEC for its registration of 50,000,000 shares on Form S-1 with the SEC. On August 10, 2010, USCI listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol USCI.\u201d USCI established its initial offering per share NAV by setting the price at $50 and issued 100,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., in exchange for $5,000,000 in cash on August 10, 2010. USCI commenced investment operations on August 10, 2010 by purchasing Futures Contracts traded on the Futures Exchanges. In order to satisfy NYSE Arca listing standards that at least 100,000 shares be outstanding at the beginning of the trading day on the NYSE Arca, USCF purchased the initial Creation Basket from the initial Authorized Participant at the initial offering price. The $1,000 fee that would otherwise be charged to the Authorized Participant in connection with an order to create or redeem was waived in connection with the initial Creation Basket. USCF agreed not to resell the shares comprising such basket except that it may require the initial Authorized Participant to repurchase all of these shares at a per share price equal to USCI's per share NAV within five days following written notice from USCF, subject to the conditions that: (i) on the date of repurchase, the initial Authorized Participant must immediately redeem these shares in accordance with the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement and (ii) immediately following such redemption at least 100,000 shares of USCI remain outstanding. USCF held such initial Creation Basket until September 3, 2010, at which time the initial Authorized Participant repurchased the shares comprising such basket in accordance with the specified conditions noted above. On September 14, 2011, USCF redeemed the 20 Sponsor Shares of USCI, and on September 19, 2011, USCF purchased five shares of USCI in the open market.\nSince its initial offering of 50,000,000 shares, USCI has not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. As of December 31, 2018, USCI had issued 35,050,000 shares, 12,350,000 of which were outstanding. As of December 31, 2018, there were 14,950,000 shares registered but not yet issued. More shares may have been issued by USCI than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the Second Amended and Restated Trust Agreement dated November 10, 2010, USAG and CPER were designated as two additional series of the Trust. Following the designation of the additional series, an initial capital contribution of $3,000 was transferred from USCF to the Trust. On November 10, 2010, the Trust transferred $1,000 to each of USAG and CPER, which was deemed a capital contribution to each series. On November 14, 2011, USCF received 40 Sponsor Shares of CPER in exchange for the previously received capital contribution, representing a beneficial interest in CPER. On December 7, 2011, USCF redeemed the 40 Sponsor Shares of CPER and purchased 40 shares of CPER in the open market. On April 13, 2012, USCF received 40 Sponsor Shares of USAG in exchange for the previously received capital contribution, representing a beneficial interest in USAG. On June 28, 2012, USCF redeemed the 40 Sponsor shares of USAG and on October 3, 2012, purchased 5 shares of USAG on the open market. USCF redeemed all Sponsor Shares of USAG on September 7, 2018. On September 7, 2018, at the close of markets, USAG ceased all trading and all of USAG's assets were liquidated on September 12, 2018.\nThe order to permit listing CPER and USAG on the NYSE Arca was received on October 20, 2011. On November 15, 2011, CPER listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol CPER.\u201d CPER established its initial offering per share NAV by setting the price at $25.00 and issued 100,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., in exchange for $2,500,000 in cash on November 15, 2011. The $1,000 fee that would otherwise be charged to the Authorized Participant in connection with an order to create or redeem was waived in connection with the initial Creation Basket.\nSince its initial offering of 30,000,000 shares, CPER has not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. As of December 31, 2018, CPER had issued 1,700,000 shares, 700,000 of which were outstanding. As of December 31, 2018, there were 28,300,000 shares registered but not yet issued. More shares may have been issued by CPER than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares.\nOn April 13, 2012, USAG listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol USAG.\u201d USAG established its initial per share NAV by setting the price at $25.00. On April 14, 2012, USCF purchased 2 initial Creation Baskets of USAG. In accordance with applicable requirements of Regulation M under the Exchange Act, no Creation Baskets were offered to Authorized Participants nor were the shares listed on the NYSE Arca until five business days had elapsed from the date of USCF's purchase of the initial Creation Basket on April 4, 2012. The fee that would have otherwise been charged in connection with an order to create or redeem was waived in connection with the initial Creation Basket.\nA new series of the Trust was designated on June 1, 2016, the USCF Canadian Crude Oil Index Fund ( UCCO\u201d). UCCO has not commenced operations as of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K. USCF and the Trustee entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement effective as of December 15, 2017. The Fund filed to withdraw from registration on December 19, 2018.\nSince its initial offering of 20,000,000 shares, USAG had not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. As of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, USAG is no longer issuing shares.\nUnlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, shares that have been redeemed by the Trust Series cannot be resold. As a result, each Trust Series contemplates that additional offerings of its shares will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, USCI and CPER had the following Authorized Participants: BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Citadel Securities LLC, Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Goldman Sachs & Company, Jefferies & Company Inc., JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets LLC and Virtu Financial BD LLC.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017; and for the Year Ended December 31, 2017, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nUSCI\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Per share net asset value, end of year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42.48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.02 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average daily total net assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>580,702,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>515,814,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>601,364,520 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dividend and interest income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,237,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,017,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,984,573 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Annualized yield based on average daily total net assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.76 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.78 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.33 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Management fee </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,645,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,126,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,810,916 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total fees and other expenses excluding management fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,317,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,223,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,404,582 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total commissions accrued to brokers </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>527,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>776,649 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total commissions as annualized percentage of average total net assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commissions accrued as a result of rebalancing </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>508,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>505,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>752,519 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of commissions accrued as a result of rebalancing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.89 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commissions accrued as a result of creation and redemption activity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,130 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of commissions accrued as a result of creation and redemption activity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.90 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPortfolio Expenses.

two changes. First, the table below includes a column showing the change in the spot price of each of the 27 commodities for the year ended December 31, 2018. Second, while the tables above list the order of the commodities alphabetically (first by which of the six sectors a commodity falls into and then within each sector), the table below lists the commodities from the commodity that had the highest positive change in spot price to the commodity that had the lowest positive change or largest negative change in spot price. Investors are cautioned that the change in the spot price of a given commodity does not represent the actual return that USCI might have earned on any holdings in futures contracts based on that commodity. This is due to two factors. First, the return on a futures contract may be higher, or lower, than the change in the spot price of the commodity due to the impact of backwardation or contango. Second, USCI may not have owned any such futures contract for the entire time period represented in the table below. Thus, USCI's total actual return on its holdings in any of the commodities shown below may be higher, or lower, than the actual change in the spot price of the particular commodity.\nBenchmark

manage each Trust Series' portfolio such that changes in its average daily per share NAV, on a percentage basis, closely track the daily changes in the average price of the Applicable Index, also on a percentage basis. Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30-valuation days, the average daily change in a Trust Series' per share NAV is within a range of 90% to 110% (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the price of the Applicable Index. As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Applicable Index for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.50% per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time period fell between 0.45% and 0.55% (i.e., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the Applicable Index's results). Each Trust Series' portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of its per share NAV equal to the nominal price of the Applicable Index, the nominal price of any particular commodity Futures Contract or the spot price for any particular commodity. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in listed Futures Contracts and Other-Related Investments.\nUSCI\nFor the 30-valuation days ended December 31, 2018, the simple average daily change in the SDCI was (0.177)%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of USCI over the same time period was (0.184)%. The average daily difference was (0.007)% (or (0.7) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the daily movement of the SDCI, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was 11.05%, meaning that over this time period USCI's tracking error was not within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal. The first chart below shows the daily movement of USCI's per share NAV versus the daily movement of the SDCI for the 30-valuation day period ended December 31, 2018, the last trading day in December. The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of USCI as compared to the monthly value of the SDCI for the five years ended December 31, 2018.\nSince the commencement of the offering of USCI's shares to the public on August 10, 2010 to December 31, 2018, the simple average daily change in the SDCI was (0.005)%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of USCI over the same time period was (0.011)%. The average daily difference was (0.006)% (or (0.6) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the daily movement of the SDCI, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (7.34)%, meaning that over this time period USCI's tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nAn alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of USCI versus the return of its SDCI can be calculated by comparing the actual return of USCI, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that USCI's returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its SDCI.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the actual total return of USCI as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (11.75)%. This is based on an initial per share NAV of $42.48 as of December 31, 2017 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2018 of $37.49. During this time period, USCI made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if USCI's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the SDCI, USCI would have had an estimated per share NAV of $38.02 as of December 31, 2018, for a total return over the relevant time period of (11.65)%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of USCI of (11.75)% and the expected total return based on the SDCI of (11.65)% was an error over the time period of (0.10)%, which is to say that USCI's actual total return underperformed its benchmark by that percentage. USCI incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of USCI to track slightly lower or higher than daily changes in the price of the SDCI. These expenses are offset in part by the income that USCI collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings. During the year ended December 31, 2018, USCI earned interest income of $9,827,503, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 1.69% for such period. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, USCI also collected $26,600 from its Authorized Participants for creating or redeeming baskets of shares. This income also contributed to USCI's actual total return. However, if the total assets of USCI continue to increase, USCF believes that the impact on actual total returns of these fees from creations and redemptions will diminish as a percentage of the actual total return. During the year ended December 31, 2018, USCI incurred total expenses of $5,963,005. Income from interest and Authorized Participant collections net of expenses was $3,891,098, which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately 0.67% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBy comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the actual total return of USCI as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 6.15%.

During this time period, USCI made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if USCI's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the SDCI, USCI would have had an estimated per share NAV of $43.25 as of December 31, 2017, for a total return over the relevant time period of 8.07%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of USCI of 6.15% and the expected total return based on the SDCI of 8.07% was an error over the time period of (1.92)%, which is to say that USCI's actual total return underperformed its benchmark by that percentage.

This was based on an initial per share NAV of $40.52 on December 31, 2015 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2016 of $40.02. During this time period, USCI made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if USCI's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the SDCI, USCI would have had an estimated per share NAV of $40.42 as of December 31, 2016, for a total return over the relevant time period of (0.25)%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of USCI of (1.23)% and the expected total return based on the SDCI of (0.25)% was an error over the time period of (0.98)%, which is to say that USCI's actual total return underperformed its benchmark by that percentage.

The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of CPER as compared to the monthly value of the SCI for the five years ended December 31, 2018.\nSince the commencement of the offering of CPER's shares to the public on November 15, 2011 to December 31, 2018, the simple average daily change in the SCI was (0.0114)%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of CPER over the same time period was (0.0155)%. The average daily difference was (0.0041)% (or (0.41) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the daily movement of the SCI, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (3.0012)%, meaning that over this time period CPER's tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAn alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of CPER versus the return of its SCI can be calculated by comparing the actual return of CPER, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that CPER's returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its SCI.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the actual total return of CPER as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (21.90)%. This is based on an initial per share NAV of $21.05 as of December 31, 2017 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2018 of $16.44. During this time period, CPER made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if CPER's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the SCI, CPER would have had an estimated per share NAV of $16.60 as of December 31, 2018, for a total return over the relevant time period of (21.14)%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of CPER of (21.90)% and the expected total return based on the SCI of (21.14)% was an error over the time period of (0.76)%, which is to say that CPER's actual total return underperformed its benchmark by that percentage. CPER incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of CPER to track slightly lower or higher than daily changes in the price of the SCI. These expenses are offset in part by the income that CPER collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings. During the year ended December 31, 2018, CPER earned interest income of $187,804, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 1.59% for such period. During the year ended December 31, 2018, CPER collected $4,550 in fees from its Authorized Participants for creating or redeeming baskets of shares. During the year ended December 31, 2018, CPER incurred net expenses of $94,664. Income from interest and Authorized Participant collections net of expenses was $97,690, which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately 0.83% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBy comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the actual total return of CPER as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 28.67%. This was based on an initial per share NAV of $16.36 as of December 31, 2016 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2017 of $21.05. During this time period, CPER made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if CPER's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the SCI, CPER would have had an estimated per share NAV of $21.43 as of December 31, 2017, for a total return over the relevant time period of 30.99%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of CPER of 28.67% and the expected total return based on the SCI of 30.99% was an error over the time period of (2.32)%, which is to say that CPER's actual total return underperformed its benchmark by that percentage. CPER incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of CPER to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the SCI. These expenses are offset in part by the income that CPER collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings. During the year ended December 31, 2017, CPER earned interest income of $80,677, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 0.78% for such period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, CPER collected $4,550 in fees from its Authorized Participants for creating or redeeming baskets of shares. During the year ended December 31, 2017, CPER incurred net expenses of $82,799. Income from interest and Authorized Participant collections net of expenses was $2,428, which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately 0.02% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nBy comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the actual total return of CPER as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 14.89%. This was based on an initial per share NAV of $14.24 on December 31, 2015 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2016 of $16.36. During this time period, CPER made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if CPER's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the SCI, CPER would have had an estimated per share NAV of $16.50 as of December 31, 2016, for a total return over the relevant time period of 15.87%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of CPER of 14.89% and the expected total return based on the SCI of 15.87% was an error over the time period of (0.98)%, which is to say that CPER's actual total return underperformed its benchmark by that percentage. CPER incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of CPER to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the SCI. These expenses are offset in part by the income that CPER collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings. During the year ended December 31, 2016, CPER earned interest income of $9,625, which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of approximately 0.33% for such period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, CPER collected $1,400 in fees from its Authorized Participants for creating or redeeming baskets of shares. During the year ended December 31, 2016, CPER incurred net expenses of $23,593. Income from interest and Authorized Participant collections net of expenses was $(12,568), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of approximately (0.43)% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUSAG\nAs noted above, as of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, USAG is no longer issuing shares and has liquidated and distributed all proceeds to shareholders. As a result, there is no performance information available as of December 31, 2018.\nFactors That Can Impact Ability to Track the Applicable Index\nThere are currently five factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact a Trust Series' ability to accurately track its Applicable Index.\nFirst, a Trust Series may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which such Trust Series executes the trade. In that case, a Trust Series may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, which could cause the changes in the daily per share NAV of a Trust Series to either be too high or too low relative to the daily changes in the price of the Applicable Index. During the year ended December 31, 2018, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price. However, it may not always be possible for a Trust Series to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact a Trust Series' attempt to track the Applicable Index over time.\nSecond, each Trust Series incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of such Trust Series to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Applicable Index. At the same time, each Trust Series earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries. A Trust Series is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to each Trust Series' NAV. When this income exceeds the level of a Trust Series' expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), such Trust Series realizes a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of such Trust Series to track slightly higher than daily changes in the price of the Applicable Index. If short-term interest rates rise above the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would increase. Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would decrease. When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Applicable Index. USCF anticipates that interest rates may continue to increase over the near future from historical lows. However, it is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by each Trust Series may continue to be lower than interest earned by each Trust Series. As such, USCF anticipates that each Trust Series will continue to outperform its benchmark until such a time when interest earned at least equals or declines below the fees and expenses paid by each Trust Series.\nThird, a Trust Series may hold Futures Contracts in a particular commodity other than the one specified as the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract, or may hold Other Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Applicable Index's total return movements. Taking USCI as an example, assume for a given month one of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts is the NYMEX WTI physically settled Futures Contract, trading under the symbol CL,\u201d for the contract month of November 2018. It is possible that USCI could hold a NYMEX WTI financially settled Futures Contract, trading under the symbol WS,\u201d for the contract month of November 2018. Alternatively, and using the same example, USCI could hold the ICE WTI financially settled Futures Contract, also for the contract month of November 2018. As a third example, USCI could hold the NYMEX WTI physically settled Futures Contract, trading under the symbol CL,\u201d but for a contract month other than November 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, no Trust Series held any Other Related Investments.\nFourth, a Trust Series could hold Other-Related Investments. In that case, the error in tracking the Applicable Index could result in daily changes in the per share NAV of a Trust Series that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the price of the Applicable Index. During the year ended December 31, 2018, none of the Trust Series held any Other-Related Investments, but did, at times, hold Futures Contracts that were in months other than the months specified as the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract. If any Trust Series increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits or due to other market pricing or liquidity factors, such Trust Series may invest in Futures Contract months other than the designated month specified as the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract, or in Other-Related Investments, which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.\nFinally, a Trust Series could hold the same Futures contracts as its benchmark but at a different weight. This is due to the fact that the benchmark can theoretically own a fractional percentage of a Futures contract but a Trust Series must own a full contract. For a Trust Series with smaller asset base, this percentage difference can have a material impact.\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nHypothetical Performance of Each Applicable Index\nSDCI\nThe table and chart below show the hypothetical performance of the SDCI from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2018.\nHYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT USCI WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM.\nONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING.\nFOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.\nSince the SDCI was launched on December 18, 2009, there is only actual performance history of the SDCI from that date to the present. This data is available for periods prior to December 18, 2009. However, the components of the SDCI and the weighting of the components of the SDCI are established each month based on purely quantitative data that is not subject to revision based on other external factors.

The S&P GSCI\u00ae Commodity Index Total Return is a composite index of commodity sector returns representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities. The Bloomberg Commodity Index Total ReturnSM is currently composed of futures contracts on a diversified basket of commodities traded on U.S. exchanges. The Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index-Optimum Yield Total ReturnTM is designed to reflect the performance of certain wheat, corn, light sweet crude oil, heating oil, gold and aluminum futures contracts plus the returns from investing in 3-month U.S. Treasury Bills. The data for the SDCI Total Return Index is derived by using the SDCI's calculation methodology with historical prices for the futures contracts comprising the SDCI. The information about each of the indices comes from publicly-available material about such indices but is not designed to provide a thorough overview of the methodology of each index.\nNone of the indices has an investment objective identical to the SDCI. As a result, there are inherent limitations in comparing the performance of such indices against the SDCI. For more information about these indices and their methodologies, please refer to the material published by the sponsors of each such index which may be found on their websites. USCI is not responsible for any information found on such websites, and such information is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nIn the table above, Total Return\u201d refers to the return of the relevant index from December 31, 1997 to December 31, 2018; Annualized Volatility\u201d is a measure of the amount of variation or fluctuation in the returns of the relevant index. Annualized Volatility is calculated by taking the monthly standard deviation of the relevant index's return and multiplying it by the square root of 12; and Annualized Sharpe Ratio\u201d is a measure of the total return of each relevant index adjusted by the risk-free interest rate (the 90-Day U.S. Treasury Bill yield) and the volatility of each index. Many investors consider volatility to be a measure of risk, and lower volatility of investment returns is considered a positive investment attribute as opposed to higher volatility. Annualized Sharpe Ratio is a standard measure for investors to compare two different investments or indexes that have different levels of volatility. If two indexes have the same total return, but one has lower Annualized Volatility, then its Annualized Sharpe Ratio will be higher. The higher the Annualized Sharpe Ratio, the better the risk-adjusted performance. Annualized Sharpe Ratio is calculated by taking the average monthly total return of the relevant index and subtracting the then current yield on the 90-Day U.S. Treasury Bill. The annualized return of this series is then divided by the Annualized Volatility of this series, and this result is the Annualized Sharpe Ratio for the relevant index. A higher Sharpe Ratio is not a guarantee that one investment or index will in the future produce better risk adjustment total returns, but USCF believes it is a useful tool for investors to consider when making investment decisions.\nThe following chart compares the hypothetical total return of the SDCI in comparison with the actual total return of three major indexes between December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2018.\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nTen Year Comparison of Index Returns of the BCOM TR,\nS&P GSCI TR, DB LCI OY TR, and the Hypothetical Returns of the SDCI TR\n(12/31/2008-12/31/2018)\nSource: SHIM, Bloomberg\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following chart compares the hypothetical total return of the SDCI in comparison with the actual total return of three major indexes over a five year period.\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nFive Year Comparison of Index Returns of the BCOM TR,\nS&P GSCI TR, DB LCI OY TR, and the Hypothetical Returns of the SDCI TR\n(12/31/2013-12/31/2018)\nSource: SHIM, Bloomberg\nSCI\nThe table and chart below show the hypothetical performance of the SCI from December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2018.\nHYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

The Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total ReturnSM includes the contract in the Bloomberg Commodity Index Total Return that relates to a single commodity, copper (currently the Copper High Grade futures contract traded on the COMEX). The data for the SCI Total Return Index is derived by using the SCI's calculation methodology with historical prices for the futures contracts comprising the SCI. The information about the index above comes from publicly-available material about such index but is not designed to provide a thorough overview of the methodology of such index. The index noted above does not have investment objectives identical to the SCI. As a result, there are inherent limitations in comparing such performance against the SCI. For more information about the index and its methodologies, please refer to the material published by the sponsor of the Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return which may be found on its website. USCF is not responsible for any information found on such website, and such information is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nIn the table above, Total Return\u201d refers to the return of the relevant index from December 31, 1997 to December 31, 2018; Annualized Volatility\u201d is a measure of the amount of variation or fluctuation in the returns of the relevant index. Annualized Volatility is calculated by taking the monthly standard deviation of the relevant index's return and multiplying it by the square root of 12; and Annualized Sharpe Ratio\u201d is a measure of the total return of each relevant index adjusted by the risk-free interest rate (the 90-Day U.S. Treasury Bill yield) and the volatility of each index. Many investors consider volatility to be a measure of risk, and lower volatility of investment returns is considered a positive investment attribute as opposed to higher volatility. Annualized Sharpe Ratio is a standard measure for investors to compare two different investments or indexes that have different levels of volatility. If two indexes have the same total return, but one has lower Annualized Volatility, then its Annualized Sharpe Ratio will be higher. The higher the Annualized Sharpe Ratio, the better the risk-adjusted performance. Annualized Sharpe Ratio is calculated by taking the average monthly total return of the relevant index and subtracting the then current yield on the 90-Day U.S. Treasury Bill. The annualized return of this series is then divided by the Annualized Volatility of this series, and this result is the Annualized Sharpe Ratio for the relevant index. A higher Sharpe Ratio is not a guarantee that one investment or index will in the future produce better risk adjustment total returns, but USCF believes it is a useful tool for investors to consider when making investment decisions.\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following chart compares the hypothetical total return of the SCI in comparison with the actual return of three major indexes between December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2018.\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nTen Year Comparison of Index Returns of\nBCOM HG TR, Spot Copper Price, Spot Copper Price less Storage Cost, and\nthe Hypothetical Returns of the SCI TR (12/31/2008-12/31/2018)\nSource: SHIM, Bloomberg, LME\nThe following chart compares the hypothetical total return of the SCI in comparison with the actual total return of two major indices and spot copper prices (less storage cost) over a five year period.\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nFive Year Comparison of Index Returns of\nBCOM HG TR, Spot Copper Price, Spot Copper Price less Storage Cost, and\nthe Hypothetical Returns of the SCI (12/31/2013-12/31/2018)\nSource: SHIM, Bloomberg, LME\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSDAI\nThe table and chart below show the hypothetical performance of the SDAI from December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2018.\nHYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT USAG WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM.\nONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.\nSince the SDAI was launched on September 23, 2010, there is only actual performance history of the SDAI from that date to the present. However, the components of the SDAI and the weighting of the components of the SDAI are established each month based on purely quantitative data that is not subject to revisions based on other external factors. This data is available for periods prior to September 23, 2010. As a result, the table below reflects how the SDAI would have performed from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2018 had it been in effect during such time period. The performance data does not reflect any reinvestment or distribution of profits, commission charges, management fees or other expenses that would have been incurred in connection with operating and managing a commodity pool designed to track the SDAI.

The S&P GSCI\u00ae Agriculture Index Total Return comprises the commodities: Wheat (Chicago and Kansas), Corn, Soybeans, Cotton, Sugar, Coffee, and Cocoa, and is part of a series of sub-indices representing components of the S&P GSCI. The Bloomberg Agriculture Subindex Total ReturnSM is currently composed of seven futures contracts on agricultural commodities traded on U.S. exchanges. The Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index-Optimum Yield Agriculture Total ReturnTM is designed to reflect the performance of certain corn, wheat, soybean and sugar futures contracts plus the returns from investing in 3 month U.S. Treasury Bills. The data for the SDAI is derived by using the SDAI's calculation methodology with historical prices for the futures contracts comprising the SDAI. The information about each of the indices comes from publicly-available material about such indices but is not designed to provide a thorough overview of the methodology of each index.

The Trust's application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.\nUSCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing the Trust's financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of Applicable Interests, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and OTC swaps) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by each Trust Series for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while OTC swaps are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis. In addition, each Trust Series estimates interest income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents. These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>88 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNone of the Trust Series has made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. Each Trust Series has met, and it is anticipated that each Trust Series will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments, or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times. Each Trust Series' liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its OTC swaps, if applicable, and payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations.\u201d\nEach Trust Series currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. Each Trust Series has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Applicable Interests. Each Trust Series invests in Applicable Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Applicable Interests. A significant portion of each Trust Series' NAV is held in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Applicable Interests. The balance of the assets is held in each Trust Series' account at the Custodian and in Treasuries at one or more FCMs. Income received from any investments in money market funds and Treasuries by a Trust Series will be paid to such Trust Series. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Trust Series' expenses did not exceed the income earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets. During the year ended December 31, 2017, each Trust Series' expenses did not exceed the income earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets.\nEach Trust Series' investments in Applicable Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.\u201d During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit. Such market conditions could prevent a Trust Series from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, none of the Trust Series purchased or liquidated any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, no Trust Series can predict whether such an event may occur in the future.\nPrior to the initial offering of each Trust Series, all payments with respect to each Trust Series' expenses are paid by USCF. None of the Trust Series has an obligation or intention to refund such payments made by USCF. USCF is under no obligation to pay any Trust Series' future expenses. Since the initial offering of shares, each Trust Series has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (iv) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (v) the fees of the Trustee in connection with its services as Delaware trustee of the Trust, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of the Trust Series' Marketing Agent, Administrator and Custodian, the trading advisory and licensing fees of SummerHaven and offering expenses relating to the initial offering of shares of each Trust Series. If USCF and each Trust Series are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, one or more of the Trust Series could terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nMarket Risk\nTrading in Applicable Interests, such as Futures Contracts, involves each Trust Series entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell specified amounts of commodities at a specified date in the future. The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed each Trust Series' future cash requirements since each Trust Series intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, each Trust Series is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts. Each Trust Series considers the fair value\u201d of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with each Trust Series' commitments to purchase a specific commodity will be limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held.\nEach Trust Series' exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for commodities, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Applicable Interest markets and the relationships among the contracts held by each such Trust Series. The limited experience that each Trust Series has had in utilizing its model to trade in Applicable Interests in a manner intended to track the changes in the Applicable Index, as well as drastic market occurrences, could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor's capital.\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Risk\nWhen a Trust Series enters into Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the Futures Exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange. In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk. The Trust Series are not currently a member of any clearinghouse. Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. Unlike in the case of exchange-traded Futures Contracts, the counterparty to an OTC contract is generally a single bank or other financial institution. As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in OTC transactions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to a Trust Series in such circumstances.\nUSCF attempts to manage the credit risk of each Trust Series by following various trading limitations and policies. In particular, each Trust Series generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments it holds. USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades and entering into OTC transactions only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of each Trust Series to limit its credit exposure. Each Trust Series' commodity broker, or any other broker that may be retained by a Trust Series in the future, when acting as the Trust Series' FCM in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to a Trust Series, all assets of a Trust Series relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading. FCMs are not allowed to commingle a Trust Series' assets with their other assets. In addition, the CFTC requires futures commission merchants to hold in a secure account a Trust Series' assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the only foreign exchange on which USCI made investments was the LME, which is a London based metal commodities exchange. During the year ended December 31, 2018, CPER did not make investments on any foreign exchanges. Such Futures Contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars.\nIn the future, a Trust Series may purchase OTC swaps, see", "summary": "- The following table contains data on the net

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of the Trust included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Trust's actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe the Trust's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d intend\u201d or project,\u201d the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and the Trust cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. The Trust's actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.\nThe Trust has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and the Trust assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although the Trust undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that the Trust may make directly to them or through reports that the Trust in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nIntroduction\nEach Trust Series is a commodity pool that issues shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in such Trust Series that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. The Trust Series are series of the Trust, a Delaware statutory trust formed on December 21, 2009.\nUnited States Commodity Index Fund\nUSCI invests in futures contracts for commodities that are traded on the Futures Exchanges and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, Other Commodity-Related Investments. Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USCI to invest in Other Commodity Related Investments would be those allowing USCI to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.\nThe investment objective of USCI is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SDCI, plus interest earned on USCI's collateral holdings, less USCI's expenses. USCF does not intend to operate USCI in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts (as defined below) that comprise the SDCI or the prices of any particular group of Futures Contracts. USCI will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. USCI believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments. The SDCI is designed to reflect the performance of a diversified group of commodities. The SDCI is comprised of 14 Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis from a list of 27 possible Futures Contracts. The Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SDCI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Futures Contracts\u201d. The SDCI is owned and maintained by SummerHaven Index Management, LLC ( SHIM\u201d) and calculated and published by Bloomberg, L.P. ( Bloomberg\u201d). USCI invests first in the current Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other Futures Contracts intended to replicate the return on the current Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and, thereafter may hold Futures Contracts in a particular commodity other than one specified as the Benchmark Component Futures Contract, or may hold Other Commodity-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, but may fail to closely track the SDCI's total return movements.\nUSCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments such that daily changes in its' per share NAV closely track the daily changes in the price of the SDCI. USCI's positions in Commodity Interests are rebalanced on a monthly basis in order to track the changing nature of the SDCI. If Futures Contracts relating to a particular commodity remain in the SDCI from one month to the next, such Futures Contracts are rebalanced to the 7.14% target weight. Specifically, on the Selection Date, it will be determined if a current Benchmark Component Futures Contract will be replaced by a new Futures Contract in either the same or different underlying commodity as a Benchmark Component Futures Contract for the following month, in which case USCI's investments would have to be changed accordingly. In order that USCI's trading does not unduly cause extraordinary market movements, and to make it more difficult for third parties to profit by trading based on market movements that could be expected from changes in the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, USCI's investments typically are not rebalanced entirely on a single day, but rather typically rebalanced over a period of four days. After fulfilling the margin and collateral requirements with respect to its Commodity Interests, USCF invests the remainder of USCI's proceeds from the sale of shares in Treasuries or cash equivalents, and/or merely hold such assets in cash (generally in interest-bearing accounts).\n 59 \nUSCI's shares began trading on August 10, 2010. As of December 31, 2018, USCI held 2,253 Futures Contracts on the NYMEX, 2,276 Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures, 4,037 Futures Contracts on the CBOT, 1,121 Futures Contracts on the CME, 5,819 Futures Contracts on the LME and 753 Futures Contracts on the COMEX, totaling 16,259 futures contracts.\nUnited States Copper Index Fund\nCPER invests in Futures Contracts for commodities that are traded on the COMEX and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, Other Copper-Related Investments. Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause CPER to invest in Other Copper-Related Investments would be those allowing CPER to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.\nThe investment objective of CPER is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SCI, plus interest earned on CPER's collateral holdings, less CPER's expenses. USCF does not intend to operate CPER in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts (as defined below) that comprise the SCI or the prices of any particular group of Futures Contracts. CPER will not seek to achieve a stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Copper-Related Investments (as defined below). The SCI is designed to reflect the performance of the investment returns from a portfolio of copper futures contracts. The SCI is owned and maintained by SHIM and calculated and published by the NYSE Arca. The SCI is comprised of either two or three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis based on quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the Eligible Copper Futures Contracts developed by SHIM. The Eligible Copper Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SCI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts.\u201d\nCPER's shares began trading on November 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2018, CPER held 174 Futures Contracts on the COMEX.\nUnited States Agriculture Index Fund\nUSAG invested in Futures Contracts for commodities traded on the ICE Futures US, the ICE Futures Canada, the CBOT, the CME and the Kansas City Board of Trade ( KCBT\u201d) and to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, Other Agriculture-Related Investments (as defined below). Market conditions that USCF anticipated could cause USAG to invest in Other Agriculture-Related Investments would be those that allowed USAG to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.\nThe investment objective of USAG was for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Dynamic Agriculture Index Total ReturnSM (the SDAI\u201d), plus interest earned on USAG's collateral holdings, less USAG's expenses. USCF's intention was not to operate USAG in a fashion such that its per share NAV would equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts (as defined below) that comprise the SDAI or the prices of any particular group of Agriculture Futures Contracts. The SDAI is designed to reflect the performance of a diversified group of agricultural commodities. The SDAI is owned and maintained by SHIM and calculated and published by the NYSE Arca comprised of 14 Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis based on quantitative formulas developed by SHIM. The Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SDAI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts.\u201d\nUSAG's shares began trading on April 13, 2012 and ceased trading on September 7, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, USAG had liquidated all its assets and distributed cash pro rata to all remaining shareholders.\nOn August 7, 2018, the Board of Directors of USCF determined that USAG could not continue its business and operations in an economically efficient manner due to USAG's inability to attract sufficient assets, thereby hindering its ability to operate efficiently. On that date, the Board of Directors of USCF also authorized and approved the closing and liquidation of USAG together with a plan of liquidation for USAG. The Trust filed a current report on Form 8-K dated August 8, 2018 with the SEC that included, as an exhibit a press release and the USAG plan of liquidation. USAG also filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC dated August 8, 2018.\nOn September 6, 2018, USAG began the process of liquidating its portfolio. As of the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca on September 6, 2018, USAG ceased accepting orders for Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets from authorized participants. Trading in the shares of USAG on the NYSE Arca was suspended prior to the open of the market on September 7, 2018. On September 7, 2018, the Trust, on behalf of USAG, filed a post-effective amendment to the registration statement with the SEC to terminate the offering of registered and unsold shares of USAG and, thereafter, the NYSE Arca filed a Form 25 to effect the withdrawal of the listings for USAG's shares. The liquidation date for USAG was September 12, 2018 and the proceeds of the liquidation were sent to all remaining shareholders of USAG on or about September 13, 2018.\n 60 \nRegulation of Commodity Interests\nThe regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the SEC, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact the Trust Series are discussed in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nCommodity Markets\nCommodity Futures Price Movements\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\nAs measured by the four major diversified commodity indexes listed below, commodity futures prices exhibited a mostly downward trend during the year ended December 31, 2018. The table below compares the total returns of the SDCI to the three major diversified commodity indexes over this time period.\n\n (1) The inception date for the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Total ReturnSM is December 2009. \n (2) Source: Bloomberg \nThe value of the SDCI as of January 1, 2018 was $1,364.38. As of December 31, 2018, the value of the SDCI was $1,221.18, down approximately (10.50)% over the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe return of approximately (10.50)% on the SDCI listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts due to the impact of trading costs and other expenses. USCI's per share NAV began the year at $42.48 and ended the year at $37.49 on December 31, 2018, a decrease of approximately (11.75)% over the year. USCI's per share NAV reached its high for the year on May 22, 2018 at $45.23 and reached its low for the year on December 24, 2018 at $37.43. See \"Tracking Each Trust Series' Benchmark\" below for information about how expenses and income affect USCI's per share NAV.\nCopper Markets\nCopper Futures Price Movements\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\nAs measured by the two major copper indexes, copper futures prices exhibited a downward trend during the year ended December 31, 2018. The table below compares the total returns of the SCI to the Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return over this time period.\n\n (1) The inception date for the SummerHaven Copper Index Total ReturnTM is November 2010. \n (2) Source: Bloomberg \nThe value of the SCI as of January 1, 2018 was $1,069.01. As of December 31, 2018, the value of the SCI was $842.94, down (21.15)% over the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe return of approximately (21.15)% on the SCI listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts due to the impact of trading costs and other expenses. CPER's per share NAV began the year at $21.05 and ended the year at $16.44 on December 31, 2018, a decrease of approximately (21.90)% over the year. CPER's per share NAV reached its high for the year on June 8, 2018 at $20.93 and reached its low for the year on August 15, 2018 at $16.19. See \"Tracking Each Trust Series' Benchmark\" below for information about how expenses and income affect CPER's per share NAV.\n 61 \nAgriculture Markets\nAgriculture Futures Price Movements\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 (In Liquidation)*\nAs measured by the three major agriculture indexes listed below, agriculture futures prices exhibited moderate daily swings along with a mostly downward trend during the year ended December 31, 2018. The table below compares the total returns of the SDAI to the two major agriculture indexes over this time period.\n\n (1) The inception date for the SummerHaven Dynamic Agriculture Index Total ReturnSM is September 2010. \n (2) Source: Bloomberg \nThe value of the SDAI as of January 1, 2018 was $253.46. As of December 31, 2018, the value of the SDAI was $231.22, down approximately (8.77)% over the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe return of approximately (8.77)% on the SDAI listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts due to the impact of trading costs and other expenses. USAG's per share NAV began the period at $17.51 and ended the period at $15.79 on September 6, 2018, a decrease of approximately (9.82)% over the period. USAG's per share NAV reached its high for the period on March 5, 2018 at $18.23 and reached its low for the period on August 30, 2018 at $15.65. See \"Tracking Each Trust Series' Benchmark\" below for information about how expenses and income affect USAG's per share NAV.\n* USAG ceased trading on the NYSE Arca on September 7, 2018 and the Fund's liquidation date was September 12, 2018.\nValuation of Futures Contracts and the Computation of the Per Share NAV\nEach Trust Series' NAV is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Trust Series' Administrator uses the closing prices on the relevant Futures Exchanges of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts (determined at the earlier of the close of such exchange or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the Futures Exchanges, but calculates or determines the value of all other investments of such Trust Series using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments.\nResults of Operations\nOn July 30, 2010, USCI received a notice of effectiveness from the SEC for its registration of 50,000,000 shares on Form S-1 with the SEC. On August 10, 2010, USCI listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol USCI.\u201d USCI established its initial offering per share NAV by setting the price at $50 and issued 100,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., in exchange for $5,000,000 in cash on August 10, 2010. USCI commenced investment operations on August 10, 2010 by purchasing Futures Contracts traded on the Futures Exchanges. In order to satisfy NYSE Arca listing standards that at least 100,000 shares be outstanding at the beginning of the trading day on the NYSE Arca, USCF purchased the initial Creation Basket from the initial Authorized Participant at the initial offering price. The $1,000 fee that would otherwise be charged to the Authorized Participant in connection with an order to create or redeem was waived in connection with the initial Creation Basket. USCF agreed not to resell the shares comprising such basket except that it may require the initial Authorized Participant to repurchase all of these shares at a per share price equal to USCI's per share NAV within five days following written notice from USCF, subject to the conditions that: (i) on the date of repurchase, the initial Authorized Participant must immediately redeem these shares in accordance with the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement and (ii) immediately following such redemption at least 100,000 shares of USCI remain outstanding. USCF held such initial Creation Basket until September 3, 2010, at which time the initial Authorized Participant repurchased the shares comprising such basket in accordance with the specified conditions noted above. On September 14, 2011, USCF redeemed the 20 Sponsor Shares of USCI, and on September 19, 2011, USCF purchased five shares of USCI in the open market.\nSince its initial offering of 50,000,000 shares, USCI has not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. As of December 31, 2018, USCI had issued 35,050,000 shares, 12,350,000 of which were outstanding. As of December 31, 2018, there were 14,950,000 shares registered but not yet issued. More shares may have been issued by USCI than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares.\n 62 \nIn connection with the Second Amended and Restated Trust Agreement dated November 10, 2010, USAG and CPER were designated as two additional series of the Trust. Following the designation of the additional series, an initial capital contribution of $3,000 was transferred from USCF to the Trust. On November 10, 2010, the Trust transferred $1,000 to each of USAG and CPER, which was deemed a capital contribution to each series. On November 14, 2011, USCF received 40 Sponsor Shares of CPER in exchange for the previously received capital contribution, representing a beneficial interest in CPER. On December 7, 2011, USCF redeemed the 40 Sponsor Shares of CPER and purchased 40 shares of CPER in the open market. On April 13, 2012, USCF received 40 Sponsor Shares of USAG in exchange for the previously received capital contribution, representing a beneficial interest in USAG. On June 28, 2012, USCF redeemed the 40 Sponsor shares of USAG and on October 3, 2012, purchased 5 shares of USAG on the open market. USCF redeemed all Sponsor Shares of USAG on September 7, 2018. On September 7, 2018, at the close of markets, USAG ceased all trading and all of USAG's assets were liquidated on September 12, 2018.\nThe order to permit listing CPER and USAG on the NYSE Arca was received on October 20, 2011. On November 15, 2011, CPER listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol CPER.\u201d CPER established its initial offering per share NAV by setting the price at $25.00 and issued 100,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., in exchange for $2,500,000 in cash on November 15, 2011. The $1,000 fee that would otherwise be charged to the Authorized Participant in connection with an order to create or redeem was waived in connection with the initial Creation Basket.\nSince its initial offering of 30,000,000 shares, CPER has not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. As of December 31, 2018, CPER had issued 1,700,000 shares, 700,000 of which were outstanding. As of December 31, 2018, there were 28,300,000 shares registered but not yet issued. More shares may have been issued by CPER than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares.\nOn April 13, 2012, USAG listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol USAG.\u201d USAG established its initial per share NAV by setting the price at $25.00. On April 14, 2012, USCF purchased 2 initial Creation Baskets of USAG. In accordance with applicable requirements of Regulation M under the Exchange Act, no Creation Baskets were offered to Authorized Participants nor were the shares listed on the NYSE Arca until five business days had elapsed from the date of USCF's purchase of the initial Creation Basket on April 4, 2012. The fee that would have otherwise been charged in connection with an order to create or redeem was waived in connection with the initial Creation Basket.\nA new series of the Trust was designated on June 1, 2016, the USCF Canadian Crude Oil Index Fund ( UCCO\u201d). UCCO has not commenced operations as of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K. USCF and the Trustee entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement effective as of December 15, 2017. The Fund filed to withdraw from registration on December 19, 2018.\nSince its initial offering of 20,000,000 shares, USAG had not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. As of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, USAG is no longer issuing shares.\nUnlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, shares that have been redeemed by the Trust Series cannot be resold.

The table below lists the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts held during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBenchmark Component Futures Contracts for USCI\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of the Trust included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Trust's actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe the Trust's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d intend\u201d or project,\u201d the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and the Trust cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. The Trust's actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.\nThe Trust has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and the Trust assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although the Trust undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that the Trust may make directly to them or through reports that the Trust in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nIntroduction\nEach Trust Series is a commodity pool that issues shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in such Trust Series that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. The Trust Series are series of the Trust, a Delaware statutory trust formed on December 21, 2009.\nUnited States Commodity Index Fund\nUSCI invests in futures contracts for commodities that are traded on the Futures Exchanges and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, Other Commodity-Related Investments. Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USCI to invest in Other Commodity Related Investments would be those allowing USCI to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.\nThe investment objective of USCI is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SDCI, plus interest earned on USCI's collateral holdings, less USCI's expenses. USCF does not intend to operate USCI in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts (as defined below) that comprise the SDCI or the prices of any particular group of Futures Contracts. USCI will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. USCI believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments. The SDCI is designed to reflect the performance of a diversified group of commodities. The SDCI is comprised of 14 Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis from a list of 27 possible Futures Contracts. The Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SDCI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Futures Contracts\u201d. The SDCI is owned and maintained by SummerHaven Index Management, LLC ( SHIM\u201d) and calculated and published by Bloomberg, L.P. ( Bloomberg\u201d). USCI invests first in the current Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other Futures Contracts intended to replicate the return on the current Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and, thereafter may hold Futures Contracts in a particular commodity other than one specified as the Benchmark Component Futures Contract, or may hold Other Commodity-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, but may fail to closely track the SDCI's total return movements.\nUSCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments such that daily changes in its' per share NAV closely track the daily changes in the price of the SDCI. USCI's positions in Commodity Interests are rebalanced on a monthly basis in order to track the changing nature of the SDCI. If Futures Contracts relating to a particular commodity remain in the SDCI from one month to the next, such Futures Contracts are rebalanced to the 7.14% target weight. Specifically, on the Selection Date, it will be determined if a current Benchmark Component Futures Contract will be replaced by a new Futures Contract in either the same or different underlying commodity as a Benchmark Component Futures Contract for the following month, in which case USCI's investments would have to be changed accordingly. In order that USCI's trading does not unduly cause extraordinary market movements, and to make it more difficult for third parties to profit by trading based on market movements that could be expected from changes in the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, USCI's investments typically are not rebalanced entirely on a single day, but rather typically rebalanced over a period of four days. After fulfilling the margin and collateral requirements with respect to its Commodity Interests, USCF invests the remainder of USCI's proceeds from the sale of shares in Treasuries or cash equivalents, and/or merely hold such assets in cash (generally in interest-bearing accounts).\n 59 \nUSCI's shares began trading on August 10, 2010. As of December 31, 2018, USCI held 2,253 Futures Contracts on the NYMEX, 2,276 Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures, 4,037 Futures Contracts on the CBOT, 1,121 Futures Contracts on the CME, 5,819 Futures Contracts on the LME and 753 Futures Contracts on the COMEX, totaling 16,259 futures contracts.\nUnited States Copper Index Fund\nCPER invests in Futures Contracts for commodities that are traded on the COMEX and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, Other Copper-Related Investments. Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause CPER to invest in Other Copper-Related Investments would be those allowing CPER to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.\nThe investment objective of CPER is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SCI, plus interest earned on CPER's collateral holdings, less CPER's expenses. USCF does not intend to operate CPER in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts (as defined below) that comprise the SCI or the prices of any particular group of Futures Contracts. CPER will not seek to achieve a stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Copper-Related Investments (as defined below). The SCI is designed to reflect the performance of the investment returns from a portfolio of copper futures contracts. The SCI is owned and maintained by SHIM and calculated and published by the NYSE Arca. The SCI is comprised of either two or three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis based on quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the Eligible Copper Futures Contracts developed by SHIM. The Eligible Copper Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SCI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts.\u201d\nCPER's shares began trading on November 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2018, CPER held 174 Futures Contracts on the COMEX.\nUnited States Agriculture Index Fund\nUSAG invested in Futures Contracts for commodities traded on the ICE Futures US, the ICE Futures Canada, the CBOT, the CME and the Kansas City Board of Trade ( KCBT\u201d) and to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, Other Agriculture-Related Investments (as defined below). Market conditions that USCF anticipated could cause USAG to invest in Other Agriculture-Related Investments would be those that allowed USAG to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing.\nThe investment objective of USAG was for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Dynamic Agriculture Index Total ReturnSM (the SDAI\u201d), plus interest earned on USAG's collateral holdings, less USAG's expenses. USCF's intention was not to operate USAG in a fashion such that its per share NAV would equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts (as defined below) that comprise the SDAI or the prices of any particular group of Agriculture Futures Contracts. The SDAI is designed to reflect the performance of a diversified group of agricultural commodities. The SDAI is owned and maintained by SHIM and calculated and published by the NYSE Arca comprised of 14 Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis based on quantitative formulas developed by SHIM. The Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SDAI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts.\u201d\nUSAG's shares began trading on April 13, 2012 and ceased trading on September 7, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, USAG had liquidated all its assets and distributed cash pro rata to all remaining shareholders.\nOn August 7, 2018, the Board of Directors of USCF determined that USAG could not continue its business and operations in an economically efficient manner due to USAG's inability to attract sufficient assets, thereby hindering its ability to operate efficiently. On that date, the Board of Directors of USCF also authorized and approved the closing and liquidation of USAG together with a plan of liquidation for USAG. The Trust filed a current report on Form 8-K dated August 8, 2018 with the SEC that included, as an exhibit a press release and the USAG plan of liquidation. USAG also filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC dated August 8, 2018.\nOn September 6, 2018, USAG began the process of liquidating its portfolio. As of the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca on September 6, 2018, USAG ceased accepting orders for Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets from authorized participants. Trading in the shares of USAG on the NYSE Arca was suspended prior to the open of the market on September 7, 2018. On September 7, 2018, the Trust, on behalf of USAG, filed a post-effective amendment to the registration statement with the SEC to terminate the offering of registered and unsold shares of USAG and, thereafter, the NYSE Arca filed a Form 25 to effect the withdrawal of the listings for USAG's shares. The liquidation date for USAG was September 12, 2018 and the proceeds of the liquidation were sent to all remaining shareholders of USAG on or about September 13, 2018.\n 60 \nRegulation of Commodity Interests\nThe regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the SEC, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact the Trust Series are discussed in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A.

As of December 31, 2018, the value of the SDAI was $231.22, down approximately (8.77)% over the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe return of approximately (8.77)% on the SDAI listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts due to the impact of trading costs and other expenses. USAG's per share NAV began the period at $17.51 and ended the period at $15.79 on September 6, 2018, a decrease of approximately (9.82)% over the period. USAG's per share NAV reached its high for the period on March 5, 2018 at $18.23 and reached its low for the period on August 30, 2018 at $15.65. See \"Tracking Each Trust Series' Benchmark\" below for information about how expenses and income affect USAG's per share NAV.\n* USAG ceased trading on the NYSE Arca on September 7, 2018 and the Fund's liquidation date was September 12, 2018.\nValuation of Futures Contracts and the Computation of the Per Share NAV\nEach Trust Series' NAV is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Trust Series' Administrator uses the closing prices on the relevant Futures Exchanges of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts (determined at the earlier of the close of such exchange or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the Futures Exchanges, but calculates or determines the value of all other investments of such Trust Series using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments.\nResults of Operations\nOn July 30, 2010, USCI received a notice of effectiveness from the SEC for its registration of 50,000,000 shares on Form S-1 with the SEC. On August 10, 2010, USCI listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol USCI.\u201d USCI established its initial offering per share NAV by setting the price at $50 and issued 100,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., in exchange for $5,000,000 in cash on August 10, 2010. USCI commenced investment operations on August 10, 2010 by purchasing Futures Contracts traded on the Futures Exchanges. In order to satisfy NYSE Arca listing standards that at least 100,000 shares be outstanding at the beginning of the trading day on the NYSE Arca, USCF purchased the initial Creation Basket from the initial Authorized Participant at the initial offering price. The $1,000 fee that would otherwise be charged to the Authorized Participant in connection with an order to create or redeem was waived in connection with the initial Creation Basket. USCF agreed not to resell the shares comprising such basket except that it may require the initial Authorized Participant to repurchase all of these shares at a per share price equal to USCI's per share NAV within five days following written notice from USCF, subject to the conditions that: (i) on the date of repurchase, the initial Authorized Participant must immediately redeem these shares in accordance with the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement and (ii) immediately following such redemption at least 100,000 shares of USCI remain outstanding. USCF held such initial Creation Basket until September 3, 2010, at which time the initial Authorized Participant repurchased the shares comprising such basket in accordance with the specified conditions noted above. On September 14, 2011, USCF redeemed the 20 Sponsor Shares of USCI, and on September 19, 2011, USCF purchased five shares of USCI in the open market.\nSince its initial offering of 50,000,000 shares, USCI has not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. As of December 31, 2018, USCI had issued 35,050,000 shares, 12,350,000 of which were outstanding. As of December 31, 2018, there were 14,950,000 shares registered but not yet issued. More shares may have been issued by USCI than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares.\n 62 \nIn connection with the Second Amended and Restated Trust Agreement dated November 10, 2010, USAG and CPER were designated as two additional series of the Trust. Following the designation of the additional series, an initial capital contribution of $3,000 was transferred from USCF to the Trust. On November 10, 2010, the Trust transferred $1,000 to each of USAG and CPER, which was deemed a capital contribution to each series. On November 14, 2011, USCF received 40 Sponsor Shares of CPER in exchange for the previously received capital contribution, representing a beneficial interest in CPER. On December 7, 2011, USCF redeemed the 40 Sponsor Shares of CPER and purchased 40 shares of CPER in the open market. On April 13, 2012, USCF received 40 Sponsor Shares of USAG in exchange for the previously received capital contribution, representing a beneficial interest in USAG. On June 28, 2012, USCF redeemed the 40 Sponsor shares of USAG and on October 3, 2012, purchased 5 shares of USAG on the open market. USCF redeemed all Sponsor Shares of USAG on September 7, 2018. On September 7, 2018, at the close of markets, USAG ceased all trading and all of USAG's assets were liquidated on September 12, 2018.\nThe order to permit listing CPER and USAG on the NYSE Arca was received on October 20, 2011. On November 15, 2011, CPER listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol CPER.\u201d CPER established its initial offering per share NAV by setting the price at $25.00 and issued 100,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., in exchange for $2,500,000 in cash on November 15, 2011. The $1,000 fee that would otherwise be charged to the Authorized Participant in connection with an order to create or redeem was waived in connection with the initial Creation Basket.\nSince its initial offering of 30,000,000 shares, CPER has not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. As of December 31, 2018, CPER had issued 1,700,000 shares, 700,000 of which were outstanding. As of December 31, 2018, there were 28,300,000 shares registered but not yet issued. More shares may have been issued by CPER than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares.\nOn April 13, 2012, USAG listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol USAG.\u201d USAG established its initial per share NAV by setting the price at $25.00. On April 14, 2012, USCF purchased 2 initial Creation Baskets of USAG. In accordance with applicable requirements of Regulation M under the Exchange Act, no Creation Baskets were offered to Authorized Participants nor were the shares listed on the NYSE Arca until five business days had elapsed from the date of USCF's purchase of the initial Creation Basket on April 4, 2012. The fee that would have otherwise been charged in connection with an order to create or redeem was waived in connection with the initial Creation Basket.\nA new series of the Trust was designated on June 1, 2016, the USCF Canadian Crude Oil Index Fund ( UCCO\u201d). UCCO has not commenced operations as of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K. USCF and the Trustee entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement effective as of December 15, 2017. The Fund filed to withdraw from registration on December 19, 2018.\nSince its initial offering of 20,000,000 shares, USAG had not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. As of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, USAG is no longer issuing shares.\nUnlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, shares that have been redeemed by the Trust Series cannot be resold. As a result, each Trust Series contemplates that additional offerings of its shares will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, USCI and CPER had the following Authorized Participants: BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Citadel Securities LLC, Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Goldman Sachs & Company, Jefferies & Company Inc., JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets LLC and Virtu Financial BD LLC.\n 63 \nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017; and for the Year Ended December 31, 2017, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nUSCI\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Per share net asset value, end of year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42.48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.02 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average daily total net assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>580,702,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>515,814,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>601,364,520 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dividend and interest income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,237,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,017,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,984,573 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Annualized yield based on average daily total net assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.76 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.78 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.33 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Management fee </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,645,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,126,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,810,916 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total fees and other expenses excluding management fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,317,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,223,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,404,582 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total commissions accrued to brokers </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>527,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>776,649 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total commissions as annualized percentage of average total net assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commissions accrued as a result of rebalancing </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>508,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>505,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>752,519 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of commissions accrued as a result of rebalancing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.89 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commissions accrued as a result of creation and redemption activity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,130 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of commissions accrued as a result of creation and redemption activity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.90 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPortfolio Expenses. USCI's expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, registration fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements. The management fee that USCI pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of USCI. The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.\nThe decrease in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to decrease in values of the Futures Contracts held by USCI; and for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, the increase in the per share NAV was due to increase in the values of the Futures Contracts held by USCI.\nAverage interest rates earned on short-term investments held by USCI, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017; and were higher during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result, the amount of income earned by USCI as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017; and was higher during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

The fee was accrued daily and paid monthly.\nThe decrease in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to decrease in values of the Futures Contracts held by USAG; and for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, the decrease in the per share NAV was due to decrease in the values of the Futures Contracts held by USAG.\nAverage interest rates earned on short-term investments held by USAG, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017; and were higher during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result, the amount of income earned by USAG as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017; and was higher during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
