Our net income increased to $289.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, the highest annual net income in the Bank's history, largely due to $184.9 million in litigation settlement income related to private-label MBS for the year. In addition, advances balances grew as discussed below. Our financial condition continued to strengthen with retained earnings growing to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015, from $901.7 million at December 31, 2014, a surplus of $428.8 million over our minimum retained earnings target, as we continue to satisfy all regulatory capital requirements as of December 31, 2015. We also provided a dividend spread of 300 basis points over the daily average three-month LIBOR. Our return on average equity was 9.54 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 5.24 percent for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 430 basis points.\nNet Interest Margin\nIn 2015, net interest margin was flat relative to the year ended December 31, 2014, at 0.41 percent. We view this as a favorable outcome in the face of the continuing very low interest-rate environment discussed under - Economic Conditions - Interest-Rate Environment.\nAdvances Balances\nWe continue to deliver on our primary mission, supplying liquidity to our members, with advances balances growing to $36.1 billion at December 31, 2015, from $33.5 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase in advances was broadly based, with long-term advances as the most significant contributor. We cannot predict whether this trend will continue.\nInvestments in Private-Label MBS\nThe amortized cost of our total investments in private-label MBS and ABS backed by home-equity loans has declined to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $6.4 billion at its peak in September 30, 2007, and other-than-temporary impairment credit losses recognized in recent periods have dropped significantly from those earlier periods.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $38.8 million and $36.0 million, respectively, in interest income resulting from the increased accretable yields of certain private-label MBS for which we had previously recognized credit losses. For a discussion of this accounting treatment, see Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Investment Securities - Other-than-Temporary Impairment - Interest Income Recognition.\nExcess Stock Management Program\nOn July 24, 2015, our board of directors authorized management to implement an excess stock management program, under which we may repurchase excess stock to maintain aggregate excess stock within a targeted range between zero and $200 million. Repurchases of excess stock have led to reductions in our capital levels, including reductions to mandatorily redeemable capital stock from $298.6 million at December 31, 2014, to $42.0 million at December 31, 2015. Dividend payments on mandatorily redeemable capital stock are classified as interest expense, so the repurchase of this stock should lead to a reduction in interest expense, all other things being equal. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock amounted to $1.6 million compared with $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRegulatory Developments\nThe FHFA and other regulators with authority over us or our way of doing business have issued or proposed multiple regulations during the year and into 2016, as described in - Legislative and Regulatory Developments. Such developments affect the way we conduct business and could impact the way we satisfy our mission as well as the value of our membership.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nEconomic Environment\nThe U.S. economy in 2015 proved resilient. Against the backdrop of a historically severe winter and economic instability overseas, the U.S. economy continued to expand.\nThe labor market continued to improve, with nonfarm payroll growth averaging over 200,000 per month for the year. At five percent in December, the unemployment rate declined 0.6 percentage point since December 2014. Alternative broader gauges of unemployment also showed steady improvement. All six of the New England states continued to see unemployment rates decline between December 2014 and 2015. Over this period, the region's unemployment rate dropped 0.7 percentage points and in December 2015 was 4.7 percent.\nThe gradual recovery in the housing market continued in 2015. The FHFA reported that house prices were up 5.8 percent in December 2015 compared to a year prior. Annual house price changes were positive for all nine census regions, reflecting a broad housing market recovery across the U.S. The housing market provided a significant boost to the New England economy in 2015, with rising prices and construction activity.\nThe U.S. and New England economies appear likely to continue to grow at a modest pace. Even though equity prices have been volatile and overseas risks appear to have heightened in early 2016, continued job gains, lower energy prices, and rising house prices look likely to support consumer spending and economic growth in 2016.\nInterest-Rate Environment\nSince 2010 and continuing into 2016, we generally have been operating in a historically low interest-rate environment, which has adversely impacted our results of operations.\nWe note that on March 16, 2016, despite having increased the targeted federal funds rate for the first time since 2006 at its December 2015 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) issued a press release providing that in light of ongoing global risks and continued low price inflation, a more accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. The statement noted that the FOMC expects economic conditions that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\nThe interest-rate environment adversely impacts our results of operations. Interest rates continue to hover close to record low levels, compressing the yields and margins that we can earn on our liquidity investments and short-term advances because our funding costs essentially have a floor of zero percent. Moreover, spreads on high-quality, interest-bearing assets in which we invest remain low relative to the yields at which we can issue comparable term debt.\nThe following chart illustrates the interest-rate environment.\nThe federal funds target rate has remained constant at zero to 0.25 percent during the time periods from the fourth quarter 2014 through the third quarter 2015. On December 17, 2015, the FOMC had raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 0.25 to 0.50 percent.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015, versus the year ended December 31, 2014\nNet income increased to $289.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The reasons for the increase are discussed under - Executive Summary.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses for the year ending December 31, 2015, was $226.0 million, compared with $213.2 million for 2014. The $12.8 million increase in net interest income after provision for credit losses was attributable to a $3.5 billion increase in average earning assets, from $51.7 billion for 2014, to $55.2 billion for 2015. The increase in average earning assets was driven by a $2.3 billion increase in average advances balances and a $1.0 billion increase in average investments balances. For additional information see - Rate and Volume Analysis. Additional increases to net interest income included a $7.2 million reduction of interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock and a $2.8 million increase in accretion of discount on securities that were other-than-temporarily impaired in prior periods, but for which a significant improvement in projected cash flows has subsequently been recognized. Offsetting these increases was a $2.2 million decrease in net prepayment fees from investments and advances from $10.5 million in the year ending December 31, 2014, to $8.3 million in the year ending December 31, 2015.\nNet interest spread was 0.37 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015, a one basis point increase from 2014, and net interest margin was 0.41 percent, unchanged from 2014. The increase in net interest spread reflects a two basis point decrease in the average yield on earning assets and a three basis point decrease in the average yield on interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe following table presents major categories of average balances, related interest income/expense, and average yields for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our primary source of earnings is net interest income, which is the interest earned on advances, mortgage loans, and investments less interest paid on COs, deposits, and other sources of funds.\nTable

Therefore, a significant portion of our advances, including overnight advances, short-term fixed-rate advances, fixed-rate putable advances, certain fixed-rate bullet advances, and variable-rate advances, either earn a short-term interest rate or are swapped to a short-term index, resulting in yields that closely follow short-term market interest-rate trends. The average balance of all such advances totaled $22.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing 69.0 percent of the total average balance of advances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2015. The average balance of all such advances totaled $20.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing 66.9 percent of the total average balance of advances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, net prepayment fees on advances and investments were $8.3 million and $10.5 million, respectively. Prepayment-fee income is unpredictable and inconsistent from period to period, occurring only when advances and investments are prepaid prior to the scheduled maturity or repricing dates, and generally when prevailing reinvestment yields are lower than those of the prepaid advances.\nAverage Balance of Investments\nAverage short-term money-market investments, consisting of interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold, increased $591.4 million, or 6.2 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period in 2014. The yield earned on short-term money-market investments is highly correlated to short-term market interest rates. These investments are used for liquidity management and to manage our leverage ratio in response to fluctuations in other asset balances. We have increased these investments principally in response to growth in our advances balances to maintain the level of our contingency liquidity. For the year ended December 31, 2015, average balances of federal funds sold increased $790.4 million and average balances of securities purchased under agreements to resell decreased $224.0 million in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAverage investment-securities balances increased $450.9 million, or 5.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period in 2014, an increase consisting primarily of a $581.3 million increase in MBS offset by a $124.9 million decline in agency and supranational institutions' debentures.\nAverage Balance of COs\nAverage CO balances increased $4.1 billion, or 8.7 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period in 2014, resulting from our increased funding needs principally due to the increase in our average advances balances and short-term money-market investment balances. This overall increase consisted of an increase of $2.5 billion in CO discount notes and an increase of $1.6 billion in CO bonds.\nThe average balance of CO discount notes represented approximately 49.2 percent of total average COs during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 48.1 percent of total average COs during the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of CO bonds represented 50.8 percent and 51.9 percent of total average COs outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The proportional growth in average CO discount notes was slightly higher than our short-term asset growth.\nImpact of Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nNet interest income includes interest accrued on interest-rate-exchange agreements that are associated with advances, investments, deposits, and debt instruments that qualify for hedge accounting. We generally use derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as interest rate risk-management tools. These derivatives serve to stabilize net interest income and net interest margin when interest rates fluctuate. Accordingly, the impact of derivatives on net interest income and net interest margin should be viewed in the overall context of our risk-management strategy. The following tables show the net effect of derivatives and hedging activities on net interest income, net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, and net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Apart from litigation settlement income, as evident in the Other Income (Loss) table above, accounting for derivatives and hedged items results in the potential for considerable timing differences between income recognition from assets or liabilities and income effects of hedging instruments entered into to mitigate interest-rate risk and cash-flow activity.\nChanges in the fair value of trading securities are recorded in other income (loss). For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded net unrealized losses on trading securities of $4.9 million and unrealized gains of $972,000, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the associated economic hedges amounted to net gains of $2.7 million and $836,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition to the changes in fair value are interest accruals on these economic hedges, which resulted in net expenses of $7.0 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in other income (loss).\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, compensation and benefits expense and other operating expenses totaled $67.0 million, representing an increase of $9.5 million from the total of $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by a $9.4 million increase in compensation and benefits expense which was the result of a voluntary contribution to the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan and increases to our incentive compensation awards.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014, versus the year ended December 31, 2013\nNet income decreased to $149.8 million at December 31, 2014, from $212.3 million at December 31, 2013. A significant component of the decline was the difference in litigation settlements year-over-year. Our return on average equity was 5.24 percent at December 31, 2014, compared with 7.40 percent at December 31, 2013, a decline of 216 basis points, of which 110 basis points is attributable to the decline in litigation settlements. Compression in net interest margin led to the year-over-year decline in our net interest income, the other significant component of the decline in net income, although the decline in net interest income reflected a return to net interest spreads and margins that were closer to long-term historical norms.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreased $42.6 million from $255.9 million in 2013 to $213.3 million in 2014. Contributing to the decrease in net interest income was a decrease in net prepayment fees of $19.2 million, as well as a narrowing of the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Partially offsetting these decreases to net interest income was an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in average earning assets of $12.4 billion from $39.3 billion for 2013, to $51.7 billion for 2014. The increase in average earning assets was driven by an increase of $8.4 billion in average advances and an increase of $4.1 billion in average investment balances. Additionally, $36.0 million of our interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014, was from the accretion of discount on securities that were other-than-temporarily impaired in prior periods, but for which a significant improvement in projected cash flows has subsequently been recognized. This represents an increase of $16.3 million from $19.7 million of accretion recorded in 2013.\nIn 2014, we experienced compression in net interest margin. Net interest margin fell to 0.41 percent for the year ended December 31, 2014, from 0.65 percent for the year ended December 31, 2013. The compression resulted from the run-off of higher-yielding long-term advances, investments and mortgage loans, a reduction in prepayment fee income, and the increase in our dividends paid on mandatorily-redeemable capital stock, which are classified as interest expense.\nThe average balance of fixed-rate advances that were hedged with interest-rate swaps to yield an effective floating rate totaled $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. Therefore, a significant portion of our advances, including overnight advances, short-term fixed-rate advances, fixed-rate putable advances, certain fixed-rate bullet advances, and variable-rate advances, either earn a short-term interest rate or are swapped to a short-term index, resulting in yields that closely follow short-term market interest-rate trends. The average balance of all such advances totaled $20.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing 66.9 percent of the total average balance of advances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of all such advances totaled $12.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing 56.7 percent of the total average balance of advances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, net prepayment fees on advances and investments were $10.5 million and $29.7 million, respectively.\nAverage short-term money-market investments, consisting of interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold, increased $5.1 billion, or 111.1 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with the same period in 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, average balances of securities purchased under agreements to resell increased $2.2 billion and average balances of federal funds sold increased $2.8 billion in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nAverage investment-securities balances decreased $982.1 million, or 10.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with the same period in 2013, a decrease consisting primarily of a $1.3 billion decline in agency and supranational institutions' debentures offset by a $320.9 million increase in MBS.\nAverage CO balances increased $12.9 billion, or 37.8 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with the same period in 2013, resulting from our increased funding needs principally due to the increase in our average advances balances and short-term money-market investment balances. This overall increase consisted of an increase of $13.6 billion in CO discount notes and a decrease of $652.9 million in CO bonds.\nThe average balance of CO discount notes represented approximately 48.1 percent of total average COs during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared with 26.6 percent of total average COs during the year ended December 31, 2013. The average balance of CO bonds represented 51.9 percent and 73.4 percent of total average COs outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nImpact of Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nNet interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, was 0.41 percent and 0.65 percent, respectively. If derivatives had not been used as hedges to mitigate the impact of interest-rate fluctuations, net interest margin would have been 0.63 percent and 0.96 percent, respectively.\nOther Income (Loss) and Operating Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded net unrealized gains on trading securities of $972,000 and unrealized losses of $13.2 million, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the associated economic hedges amounted to net gains of $836,000 and $13.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition to the changes\nin fair value are interest accruals on these economic hedges, which resulted in a net expense of $7.1 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, compensation and benefits expense and other operating expenses totaled $57.5 million, representing an increase of $1.3 million from the total of $56.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nAdvances\nAt December 31, 2015, the advances portfolio totaled $36.1 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion compared with $33.5 billion at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table summarizes advances outstanding by product type at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td>Advances Outstanding by Product Type\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Par Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Par Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-rate advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,392,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,029,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term\n</td> <td>11,777,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,526,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Putable\n</td> <td>2,022,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,180,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overnight\n</td> <td>1,080,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,545,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortizing\n</td> <td>887,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>883,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other fixed-rate advances\n</td> <td>97,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>29,257,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,236,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable-rate advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simple variable (1)\n</td> <td>6,504,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,915,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Putable\n</td> <td>157,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other variable-rate indexed advances\n</td> <td>48,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>6,710,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,038,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,967,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,274,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes floating-rate advances that may be contractually prepaid by the borrower on a floating-rate reset date without incurring prepayment or termination fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 8 - Advances for disclosures relating to redemption terms of the advances portfolio.\nAdvances Credit Risk\nWe endeavor to minimize credit risk on advances by monitoring the financial condition of our borrowers and by holding sufficient collateral to protect the Bank from credit losses. All pledged collateral is subject to haircuts assigned based on our opinion of the risk that such collateral presents. We are prohibited by Section 10(a) of the FHLBank Act from making advances without sufficient collateral to secure the advance. We have never experienced a credit loss on an advance.\nWe monitor the financial condition of all members and housing associates by reviewing available financial data, such as regulatory call reports filed by depository institution members, regulatory financial statements filed with the appropriate state insurance department by insurance company members, audited financial statements of housing associates, SEC filings, and rating-agency reports to ensure that potentially troubled members are identified as soon as possible. In addition, we have access to most members' regulatory examination reports. We analyze this information on a regular basis.\nOur members continue to be challenged by economic conditions, although improvements continue. Aggregate nonperforming assets for depository institution members declined from 0.50 percent of assets as of December 31, 2014, to 0.46 percent of assets as of September 30, 2015. The aggregate ratio of tangible capital to assets among the membership increased from 9.44 percent of assets as of December 31, 2014, to 9.75 percent as of September 30, 2015. (September 30, 2015, is the date of our most recent data on our membership for this report.). There were no member failures during 2015. All of our extensions of credit to members are secured by eligible collateral as noted herein. However we could incur losses if a member were to default, if the value of the collateral pledged by the member declined to a point such that we were unable to realize sufficient value from the pledged collateral to cover the member's obligations, and we were unable to obtain additional collateral to make up for the reduction in value of such collateral. Although not expected, a default by a member with significant obligations to us could result in significant financial losses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe assign each non-insurance company borrower to one of the following three credit status categories based primarily on our assessment of the borrower's overall financial condition and other factors:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Category-1: members that are generally in satisfactory financial condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Category-2: members that show weakening financial trends in key financial indices and/or regulatory findings; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Category-3: members with financial weaknesses that present an elevated level of concern. We also place housing associates and non-member borrowers in Category-3.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe monitor the financial condition of our insurance company members quarterly. We lend to them based on our assessment of their financial condition and their pledge of sufficient amounts of eligible collateral.\nEach credit status category reflects our increasing level of control over the collateral pledged by the borrower as its financial condition weakens. Category-1 borrowers retain possession of all mortgage loan collateral pledged to us, provided the borrower executes a written security agreement and agrees to hold such collateral for our benefit. Category-1 borrowers must specifically list with us all mortgage loan collateral other than loans secured by first-mortgage loans on owner-occupied one- to four-family residential property. Category-2 borrowers retain possession of eligible mortgage loan collateral, however, we require such borrowers to specifically list all mortgage loan collateral pledged to us. Category-3 borrowers are required to place physical possession of all pledged eligible collateral with us or an approved safekeeping agent, with which we have a control agreement. All securities pledged to us by our borrowers must be delivered to us, an approved safekeeping agent, or be held by the borrower's securities corporation in a custodial account with us. We have control agreements with approved safekeeping agents which are intended to give us appropriate control over the related collateral.\nOur agreements with our borrowers require each borrower to have sufficient eligible collateral pledged to us to fully secure all outstanding extensions of credit, including advances, accrued interest receivable, standby letters of credit, MPF credit-enhancement obligations, and lines of credit (collectively, extensions of credit) at all times. We generally accept the following types of assets as collateral:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fully disbursed, first-mortgage loans on improved residential property (provided that the borrower is not in arrears by two or more payments), or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any agency thereof (including without limitation, MBS issued or guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cash or deposits in a collateral account with us; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other real-estate-related collateral acceptable to us if such collateral has a readily ascertainable value and we can perfect our security interest in the collateral.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, in the case of any community financial institution, as defined in accordance with the FHLBank Act, we may accept as collateral secured loans for small business and agriculture, or securities representing a whole interest in such secured loans.\nTo mitigate the credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk associated with collateral, we discount the book value or market value of pledged collateral to establish the lending value of the collateral to us. Collateral that we have determined to contain a low level of risk, such as U.S. government obligations, is discounted at a lower rate than collateral that carries a higher level of risk, such as commercial real estate mortgage loans. We periodically analyze the discounts applied to all eligible collateral types to verify that current discounts are sufficient to fully secure us against losses in the event of a borrower default. Our agreements with our members and borrowers grant us authority, in our sole discretion, to adjust the discounts applied to\ncollateral at any time based on our assessment of the member's financial condition, the quality of collateral pledged, or the overall volatility of the value of the collateral.\nWe generally require our members and housing associates to execute a security agreement that grants us a blanket lien on all assets of such borrower that consist of, among other types of collateral: fully disbursed whole first-mortgage loans and deeds of trust constituting first liens against real property; U.S. federal, state, and municipal obligations; GSE securities; corporate debt obligations; commercial paper; funds placed in deposit accounts with us; COs, such other items or property that are offered to us by the borrower as collateral; and all proceeds of all of the foregoing. In the case of insurance companies and housing associates, in some instances we establish a specific lien instead of a blanket lien subject to our receipt of additional safeguards from such members including larger haircuts on collateral. We protect our security interest in pledged assets by filing a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) financing statement in the appropriate jurisdiction. Our employees conduct on-site reviews of collateral pledged by borrowers to confirm the existence of the pledged collateral and to determine that the pledged collateral conforms to our eligibility requirements. We may conduct an onsite collateral review at any time.\nOur agreements with borrowers allow us, in our sole discretion, to refuse to make extensions of credit against any collateral, require substitution of collateral, or adjust the discounts applied to collateral at any time. We also may require members to pledge additional collateral regardless of whether the collateral would be eligible to originate a new extension of credit. Our agreements with our borrowers also afford us the right, in our sole discretion, to declare any borrower to be in default if we deem ourselves to be insecure.\nBeyond our practice of taking security interests in collateral, Section 10(e) of the FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted by a federally insured depository institution member or such a member's affiliate to us priority over the claims or rights of any other party, including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar entity that has the rights of a lien creditor, unless these claims and rights would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and are held by actual purchasers or by parties that are secured by actual perfected security interests. In this regard, the priority granted to our security interests under Section 10(e) may not apply when lending to insurance company members due to the anti-preemption provision contained in the McCarran-Ferguson Act in which Congress declared that federal law would not preempt state insurance law unless the federal law expressly regulates the business of insurance. Thus, if state law conflicts with Section 10(e) of the FHLBank Act, the protection afforded by this provision may not be available to us. However, we protect our security interests in the collateral pledged by our borrowers, including insurance company members, by filing UCC financing statements, or by taking possession or control of such collateral, or by taking other appropriate steps. We have not experienced any rehabilitation, conservatorship, receivership, liquidation or other insolvency event for an insurance company member and therefore have continuing uncertainty on the potential inapplicability of Section 10(e). Additionally, we note that the relevant state insolvency authority could take actions that could impede our ability to sell collateral that any such insolvent member has pledged to us.\nThe following table shows the asset quality of the one- to four-family mortgage loan portfolios held on the balance sheets of our borrowers. One- to four-family mortgage loans constitute the largest asset type pledged as collateral to us. Note that these figures include all one- to four-family mortgage loans on depository borrowers' balance sheets. The figures in this table include loans that are not pledged as collateral to us.

Moreover, borrowers in Category-1 are permitted to specifically list and identify single-family residential mortgage loans at a lower discount than is allowed if the collateral is not specifically listed and identified.\nBased upon the method by which borrowers pledge collateral to us, the following table shows the total potential lending value of the collateral that borrowers have pledged to us, net of our collateral valuation discounts as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 122: <table><tr><td>Collateral by Pledge Type\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Discounted Collateral\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateral not specifically listed and identified\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,895,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateral specifically listed and identified\n</td> <td>39,955,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateral delivered to us\n</td> <td>11,955,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe accept nontraditional and subprime loans that are underwritten in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance as eligible collateral for our advances. However, we do not accept as eligible collateral any mortgage loan that allows for negative amortization, including, but not limited to, pay-option adjustable-rate mortgage loans. We recognize that nontraditional and subprime loans may present incremental credit risk to us. Therefore, we have monitoring and review procedures in place to measure the incremental risk presented by this collateral and to mitigate this incremental credit risk. Further, we apply baseline collateral valuation discounts to nontraditional and subprime loans secured by a mortgage on the borrower's primary residence of 35 and 40 percent of book value, respectively. These discounts reflect the incremental credit risk associated with these types of loans relative to conventional mortgage loans. Borrowers in Category-1 also have the option of providing loan level data for their subprime and nontraditional loans to potentially obtain a more favorable valuation based on the credit risk profile of the pledged loan portfolio, subject to a minimum discount of 25 percent of book value. In addition, we limit the amount of borrowing capacity that a member may derive from subprime loan collateral to the lower of two times the pledging member's most recently reported capital as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or one-half of its total borrowing capacity. Additionally, private-label MBS issued or acquired and residential mortgage loans originated or acquired by our members after July 10, 2007, are not eligible collateral unless it can be documented that all loans, including all loans in MBS pools, are in compliance with regulatory underwriting standards on subprime or nontraditional lending, as applicable.\nAt both December 31, 2015 and 2014, the amount of pledged nontraditional and subprime loan collateral was nine percent of total member discounted collateral.\nWe have not recorded any allowance for credit losses on credit products at December 31, 2015, and 2014, for the reasons discussed in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 10 - Allowance for Credit Losses.\nThe following table presents the top five advance-borrowing institutions at December 31, 2015, and the interest earned on outstanding advances to such institutions for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td>Top Five Advance-Borrowing Institutions\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Par Value of Advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total Par Value of Advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted-Average Rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Advances Interest Income for the\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Citizens Bank, N.A.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,015,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>People's United Bank, N.A.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,205,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Webster Bank, N.A.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,664,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Berkshire Bank\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,173,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total of top five advance-borrowing institutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,157,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Weighted-average rates are based on the contract rate of each advance without taking into consideration the effects of interest-rate-exchange agreements that we may use as hedging instruments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestments\nAt December 31, 2015, investment securities and short-term money market instruments totaled $18.0 billion, compared with $16.9 billion at December 31, 2014.\nShort-term money-market investments increased $1.0 billion to $8.8 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with December 31, 2014.

By classifying investments as available-for-sale, we can consider these securities to be a source of short-term liquidity, if needed. From time to time, we invest in certain securities and simultaneously enter into matched-term interest-rate swaps to achieve a LIBOR-based variable yield, particularly when we can earn a wider interest spread between the swapped yield on the investment and short-term debt instruments than we can earn between the bond's fixed yield and comparable-term fixed-rate debt. Because an interest-rate swap can only be designated as a hedge of an available-for-sale investment security, we classify these investments as available-for-sale. The following table provides a summary of our available-for-sale securities.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td>Available-for-Sale Securities\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due in one year or less\n</td> <td>Due after one year through five years\n</td> <td>Due after five years through ten years\n</td> <td>Due after ten years\n</td> <td>Total Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supranational institutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>317,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>438,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>447,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>415,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. government corporations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GSEs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>888,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>700,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>822,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>856,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,542,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MBS (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. government guaranteed - single-family\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>206,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. government guaranteed - multifamily\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>744,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>744,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>871,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GSEs - single-family\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,590,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,590,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,548,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,872,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,451,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,491,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,625,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,452,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,152,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,314,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,481,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,995,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Yield on available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>0.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>6.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>2.51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>MBS maturity ranges are based on the contractual final maturity of the security.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTrading Securities\nWe classify certain investments acquired for purposes of meeting short-term contingency liquidity needs and asset/liability management as trading securities and carry them at fair value.

We place short-term funds with large, high-quality financial institutions with long-term credit ratings no lower than single-A (or equivalent) on an unsecured basis. Most of these placements expire within one day.\nIn addition to these unsecured short-term investments, we also make secured investments in the form of securities purchased under agreements to resell secured by U.S. Treasury and agency obligations, whose terms to maturity are up to 35 days. We have also invested in and are subject to secured credit risk related to MBS, ABS, and HFA securities that are directly or indirectly supported by underlying mortgage loans.\nWe actively monitor our investments' credit exposures and the credit quality of our counterparties, including assessments of each counterparty's financial performance, capital adequacy, and sovereign support as well as related market signals. We endeavor to reduce or suspend credit limits and/or seek to reduce existing exposures, as appropriate, as a result of these monitoring activities.\nCredit ratings of our investments are provided in

This limit is based on a percentage of eligible regulatory capital and the counterparty's long-term unsecured credit rating. Under these regulations, the level of eligible regulatory capital is determined as the lesser of our total regulatory capital or the eligible amount of regulatory capital of the counterparty. The eligible amount of regulatory capital is then multiplied by a specified percentage for each counterparty, which product is the maximum amount of unsecured credit exposure we may extend to that counterparty. The percentage that we may offer for extensions of unsecured credit other than overnight sales of federal funds ranges from one to 15 percent based on the counterparty's credit rating. Extensions of unsecured credit other than sales of federal funds include on- and off-balance sheet and derivative transactions. See - Derivative Instruments Credit Risk for additional information related to derivatives exposure.\nFHFA regulations allow additional unsecured credit for sales of federal funds. The specified percentage of eligible regulatory capital used for determining the maximum amount of unsecured credit exposure we may offer to a counterparty for overnight sales of federal funds is twice the amount that we may extend to that counterparty for extensions of credit other than overnight sales of federal funds reduced by the amount of any other unsecured credit exposure attributable to other than overnight sales of federal funds.\nWe are prohibited by FHFA regulations from investing in financial instruments issued by non-U.S. entities, other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks. We are also prohibited by FHFA regulations from investing in financial instruments issued by foreign sovereign governments, including members of the European Union. Our unsecured credit risk to U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks includes, among other things, the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, the counterparty may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing credit limits based on FHFA regulations, from time to time, we impose internal limits on all or specific individual counterparties that are lower than the maximum credit limits allowed by regulation.\nThe table below presents our short-term unsecured money-market credit exposure.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td>Short-term Unsecured Money-Market Credit Exposure by Investment Type\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal funds sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,550,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015, our unsecured credit exposure related to money-market instruments and debentures, including accrued interest, was $3.0 billion to eight counterparties and issuers, of which $2.1 billion was for federal funds sold, and $840.1 million was for debentures issued by GSEs and supranational institutions.

We do not expect the balance of this portfolio to change significantly in 2016 as we expect continued competition from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for loan investment opportunities. We note further that the Director of the FHFA has delayed increases in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guaranty fees and certain other fees pending further study, which increases would have tended to weaken competition from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nThe following table presents information relating to our mortgage portfolio for the five year period ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 144:

limits set by the applicable federal agency. Conventional mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios greater than 80 percent require certain amounts of primary mortgage insurance from a mortgage insurance company rated at least triple-B (or equivalent rating).\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Mortgage Loans. The allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans was $1.0 million at December 31, 2015, compared with $2.0 million at December 31, 2014.\nFor information on the determination of the allowance at December 31, 2015, see Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 10 - Allowance for Credit Losses, and for information on our methodology for estimating the allowance, see - Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Loan Losses.\nWe place conventional mortgage loans on nonaccrual status when the contractual principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. Accrued interest on nonaccrual loans is reversed against interest income. We monitor the delinquency levels of the mortgage loan portfolio on a monthly basis.

Our portfolio includes certain higher-risk conventional mortgage loans. These include high loan-to-value ratio mortgage loans and subprime mortgage loans. The higher-risk loans represent a relatively small portion of our conventional mortgage loan portfolio (4.2 percent by outstanding principal balance), but a disproportionately higher portion of the conventional mortgage loan portfolio delinquencies (33.1 percent by outstanding principal balance).

We are exposed to credit risk from mortgage insurance companies that provide credit enhancement in place of the participating financial institution and for primary mortgage insurance coverage on individual loans. As of December 31, 2015, we were the beneficiary of primary mortgage insurance coverage of $69.9 million on $278.5 million of conventional mortgage loans, and supplemental mortgage insurance coverage of $18.3 million on mortgage pools with a total unpaid principal balance of $246.4 million.\nWe have analyzed our potential loss exposure to all of the mortgage insurance companies and do not expect incremental losses based on these exposures at this time.\nDeposits\nWe offer demand and overnight deposits, custodial mortgage accounts, and term deposits to our members. Deposit programs are intended to provide members a low-risk earning asset that satisfies liquidity requirements. Deposit balances depend on members' needs to place excess liquidity and can fluctuate significantly. Due to the relatively small size of our deposit base and the unpredictable nature of member demand for deposits, we do not rely on deposits as a core component of our funding. At December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, deposits totaled $482.6 million and $369.3 million, respectively.\nConsolidated Obligations\nSee - Liquidity and Capital Resources for information regarding our COs.\nDerivative Instruments\nAll derivatives are recorded on the statement of condition at fair value and classified as either derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives outstanding with counterparties with which we have an enforceable master-netting agreement are classified as assets or liabilities according to the net fair value of derivatives aggregated by each counterparty. Derivatives that have been cleared through a clearing member with a DCO are classified as assets or liabilities according to the net fair value of those derivatives that have been transacted through a particular clearing member with a particular DCO. Derivative assets' net fair value, net of cash collateral and accrued interest, totaled $40.1 million and $14.5 million as of December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Derivative liabilities' net fair value, net of cash collateral and accrued interest, totaled $442.0 million and $558.9 million as of December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nWe offset fair-value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair-value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) arising from derivatives recognized at fair value executed with the same counterparty under a master-netting arrangement as well as arising from derivatives cleared through a DCO.\nWe base the estimated fair values of these agreements on the cost of interest-rate-exchange agreements with similar terms or available market prices. Consequently, fair values for these instruments must be estimated using techniques such as discounted cash-flow analysis and comparison with similar instruments. Estimates developed using these methods are subjective and require judgments regarding significant matters such as the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates that appropriately reflect market and credit risks. We formally establish hedging relationships associated with balance-sheet items and forecasted transactions to obtain desired economic results. These hedge relationships may include fair-value and cash-flow hedges, as well as economic hedges.\nWe had commitments for which we were obligated to invest in mortgage loans with par values totaling $24.7 million and $26.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. All commitments to invest in mortgage loans are recorded at fair value on the statement of condition as derivatives. Upon satisfaction of the commitment, the recorded fair value is then reclassified as a basis adjustment of the purchased mortgage assets.\nThe following table presents a summary of the notional amounts and estimated fair values of our outstanding derivatives, excluding accrued interest, and related hedged item by product and type of accounting treatment as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The notional amount is a factor in determining periodic interest payments or cash flows received and paid. However, the notional amount does not represent actual amounts exchanged or our overall exposure to credit and market risk. The hedge designation fair value\u201d represents the hedge classification for transactions that qualify for hedge-accounting treatment and hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate, which is LIBOR. The hedge designation \"cash flow\" represents the hedge classification for transactions that qualify for hedge-accounting treatment and hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. The hedge designation economic\u201d represents hedge strategies that do not qualify for hedge accounting, but are acceptable hedging strategies under our risk-management policy.\nTable 154:

These derivatives are entered into for our own risk-management purposes and are not related to requests from our members to enter into such contracts.\nDerivative Instruments Credit Risk. We are subject to credit risk on derivatives. This risk arises from the risk of counterparty default on the derivative. The amount of loss created by default is the replacement cost of the defaulted contract, net of any collateral held by us or pledged by us to counterparties (unsecured derivatives exposure). We accept both securities and cash collateral for uncleared derivatives (principal-to-principal derivatives that are not centrally cleared) from counterparties with\nwhom we are in a current positive fair-value position (i.e., we are in the money) by an amount that exceeds an exposure threshold (if any) defined in our master netting agreement with the counterparty. The resulting net exposure at fair value is reflected in the derivatives table below. We pledge securities and cash collateral for uncleared derivatives to counterparties with whom we are in a current negative fair-value position (i.e., we are out-of-the-money) by an amount that exceeds an exposure threshold (if any) defined in our master netting agreement with the counterparty. From time to time, due to timing differences or derivatives valuation differences between our calculated derivatives values and those of our counterparties, and to the contractual haircuts applied to securities, we receive from counterparties cash or securities collateral whose fair value is less than the current positive fair-value positions with them adjusted for any applicable exposure threshold. We pledge only cash collateral, including initial and variation margin, for cleared derivatives, but may also pledge securities for initial margin as allowed by the applicable DCO and clearing member. From time to time, due to timing differences or derivatives valuation differences between our calculated derivatives values and those of our counterparties, and to the contractual haircuts applied to securities, we pledge to counterparties cash or securities collateral whose fair value exceeds the current negative fair-value positions with them adjusted for any applicable exposures.

The credit risk arising from unsecured credit exposure on derivatives is mitigated by the credit quality of the counterparties and by the early termination ratings triggers contained in all master derivatives agreements. We enter into new uncleared derivatives only with nonmember institutions that have long-term senior unsecured credit ratings that are at or above single-A (or its equivalent) by S&P and Moody's, although risk-reducing trades may be approved for counterparties whose ratings have fallen below these ratings. We actively monitor these exposures and the credit quality of our counterparties, using stress testing of counterparty exposures and assessments of each counterparty's financial performance, capital adequacy, sovereign support, and related market signals. We can reduce or suspend credit limits and/or seek to reduce existing exposures, as appropriate, as a result of these monitoring activities. We do not enter into interest-rate-exchange agreements with other FHLBanks. We use master-netting agreements to reduce our credit exposure from counterparty defaults. The master agreements contain bilateral-collateral-exchange provisions that may require credit exposures beyond a defined amount to be secured by U.S. federal government or GSE-issued securities or cash. Exposures are measured daily, and adjustments to collateral positions are made daily. The master agreements may provide for lower amounts of unsecured exposure to lower-rated counterparties. These agreements may require us to deliver additional collateral to certain of our counterparties if our credit rating is downgraded by an NRSRO, which could increase our exposure to loss in the event of a default by a counterparty to which we were the net creditor at the time of any such default, as further detailed in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 11 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities.\nThe following counterparties accounted for more than 10 percent of the total notional amount of uncleared derivatives outstanding (dollars in thousands):\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Counterparty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Notional Amount\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\nNotional\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barclays Bank PLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,108,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,744\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,102,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22,352\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deutsche Bank AG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>982,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(333,802\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goldman Sachs Bank USA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>868,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,013\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Counterparty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Notional Amount\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\nNotional\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deutsche Bank AG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,247,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(343,004\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>JP Morgan Chase Bank NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,224,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,778\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barclays Bank PLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,110,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,880\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Bank USA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,024,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,001\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe may deposit funds with these counterparties and their affiliates for short-term money-market investments, including overnight federal funds, term federal funds, and interest-bearing certificates of deposit. We also engage in short-term secured reverse repurchase agreements with affiliates of these counterparties. All of these counterparties have affiliates that buy, sell, and distribute our COs.\nCleared derivatives. The credit risk from unsecured credit exposure on cleared swaps is principally mitigated by the DCO's structural default protections. Our internal policies require that the DCO must have a rating of at least single-A or the equivalent. We actively monitor these exposures and the credit quality of our DCO counterparties, using stress testing of DCO counterparties exposures and assessments of the DCO's structural risk protections. We can reduce existing exposures to a DCO by unwinding any trade, by entering into an offsetting trade, or by moving trades to another DCO.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur financial structure is designed to enable us to expand and contract our assets, liabilities, and capital in response to changes in membership composition and member credit needs. Our primary source of liquidity is our access to the capital markets through CO issuance, which is described in Item 1 - Business - Consolidated Obligations. Outstanding COs and the condition of the market for COs are discussed below under - Debt Financing - Consolidated Obligations. Our equity capital resources are governed by our capital plan, certain portions of which are described under - Capital below as well as by applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nLiquidity\nWe monitor our financial position in an effort to ensure that we have ready access to sufficient liquid funds to meet normal transaction requirements, take advantage of investment opportunities, fund our member credit needs, and cover unforeseen liquidity demands. We strive to maintain the liquidity necessary to meet member-credit demands, repay maturing COs, meet other obligations and commitments, and respond to changes in membership composition.\nWe are not able to predict future trends in member-credit needs since they are driven by complex interactions among a number of factors, including, but not limited to mortgage originations, other loan portfolio growth, deposit growth, and the attractiveness of the pricing and availability of advances versus other wholesale borrowing alternatives.\nOur contingency liquidity plans are intended to ensure that we are able to meet our obligations and the liquidity needs of members in the event of operational disruptions at the Bank or the Office of Finance or short-term disruptions of the capital markets.\nFor information and discussion of our guarantees and other commitments we may have, see - Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations below, and for further information and discussion of the joint and several liability for FHLBank COs, see - Debt Financing - Consolidated Obligations below.\nInternal Liquidity Sources / Liquidity Management\nLiquidity Reserves for Deposits. Applicable law requires us to hold a total amount of cash, obligations of the U.S., and advances with maturities of less than five years, in an amount not less than the amount of total member deposits with us. We have complied with this requirement during the year ended December 31, 2015. The following table provides our liquidity position with respect to this requirement.\nTable 172: <table><tr><td>Liquidity Reserves for Deposits\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquid assets(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and due from banks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,124,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advances maturing within five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,770,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,648,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquid assets(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,025,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,772,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>482,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>369,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess liquid assets(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,542,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,403,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For purposes of the regulatory requirement, liquid assets include cash, obligations of the U.S., and advances with maturities of less than five years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have developed a methodology and policies by which we measure and manage the Bank's short-term liquidity needs based on projected net cash flow and contingent obligations.\nProjected Net Cash Flow. We define projected net cash flow as projected sources of funds less projected uses of funds based on contractual maturities or expected option exercise periods, and settlement of committed asset and liabilities, as applicable. For mortgage-related cash flows and callable debt, we incorporate projected prepayments and call exercise.\nStructural Liquidity. We define structural liquidity as projected net cash flow (defined above) less assumed secondary uses of funds, for which we assume the following:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>all maturing advances are renewed;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>member overnight deposits are withdrawn at a rate of 50 percent per day;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>outstanding standby letters of credit are drawn down at a rate of 50 percent spread equally over 86 days;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>uncommitted lines of credit are drawn upon at a rate of 10 percent of the previous day's balance; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>MPF master commitments are funded at a rate of 10 percent of the previous days' total amount on the first day and at a rate of one percent on each day thereafter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above assumptions for secondary uses of funds are in excess of our ordinary experience, and therefore represent a more stressful scenario than we expect to experience. We review these assumptions periodically.\nThis methodology for measuring projected net cash flow and structural liquidity has been established by management to monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis, and to help ensure that we meet all of our obligations as they come due and to meet our members' potential demand for liquidity from us in all cases. We may adjust the amount of liquidity maintained as market conditions change from time to time using projected net cash flow and structural liquidity measurements.\nLiquidity Management Action Triggers. We maintain two liquidity management action triggers:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>if structural liquidity is less than negative $1.0 billion on or before the fifth business day following the measurement date; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>if projected net cash flow falls below zero on or before the 21st day following the measurement date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe did not breach either of these thresholds at any time during the year ended December 31, 2015. Senior management is notified if either liquidity threshold is breached and is required to determine whether or not any corrective action is necessary as a result.\nThe following table presents our projected net cash flow and structural liquidity as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 181: <table><tr><td>Projected Net Cash Flow and Structural Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2015\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Business Days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21 Days\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uses of funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,684,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,516,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Committed asset settlements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>631,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>632,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital outflow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MPF delivery commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross uses of funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,503,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,357,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sources of funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturing or projected amortization of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,725,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,634,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Committed liability settlements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>699,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>724,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and due from banks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross sources of funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,711,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,681,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected net cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,208,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,323,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Secondary uses of funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit runoff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>431,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drawdown of standby letters of credit and lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>630,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rollover of all maturing advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,638,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected funding of MPF master commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total secondary uses of funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,923,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Structural liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,284,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContingency Liquidity.

The FHFA defines contingency liquidity as projected sources of funds less uses of funds, excluding reliance on access to the CO debt markets and including funding a portion of outstanding standby letters of credit. For this purpose, outstanding standby letters of credit are assumed to be drawn down at a rate of 50 percent spread equally over 86 days following the measurement date. As defined by FHFA regulations, additional contingent sources of liquidity include the following:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>marketable securities with a maturity greater than one week and less than one year that can be sold;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>self-liquidating assets with a maturity of seven days or less;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assets that are generally accepted as collateral in the repurchase agreement market, for which we include 50 percent of unencumbered marketable securities with a maturity greater than one year; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>irrevocable lines of credit from financial institutions rated not lower than the second highest rating category by an NRSRO.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe complied with this regulatory requirement at all times during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we held a surplus of $12.0 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, of contingency liquidity for the following five business days, exclusive of access to the proceeds of CO debt issuance.\nThe following table presents our contingency liquidity as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 186: <table><tr><td>Contingency Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2015\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Business Days\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative uses of funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,684,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Committed asset settlements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>631,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drawdown of standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross uses of funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,444,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative sources of funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturing or amortizing advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,638,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Committed liability settlements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>699,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross sources of funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,370,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: sources of contingency liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Self-liquidating assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,070,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and due from banks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketable securities available for repo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,002,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sources of contingency liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,076,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contingency liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,003,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditional Liquidity Requirements. In addition, certain FHFA guidance requires us to maintain sufficient liquidity through short-term investments in an amount at least equal to our anticipated cash outflows under two different scenarios. One scenario assumes that we cannot borrow funds from the capital markets for a period of 15 business days and that during that time we do not renew any maturing, prepaid, and put or called advances. The second scenario assumes that we cannot raise funds in the capital markets for five business days and that during that period we will renew maturing and called advances for all members except very large, highly rated members. We were in compliance with these liquidity requirements at all times during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBalance Sheet Funding Gap Policy. Further, we are sensitive to maintaining an appropriate funding balance between our assets and liabilities and maintain a policy that limits the potential gap between assets inclusive of projected prepayments, funded by liabilities, inclusive of projected calls, maturing in less than one year. The established policy limits this imbalance to a gap of 20 percent of total assets and sets a management action trigger at a gap of 10 percent of total assets. We maintained compliance with this limit and its management action trigger at all times during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, this gap averaged 4.7 percent (the maximum level at any month-end during the year was 5.0 percent and the minimum level at any month-end during the year was 0.1 percent). As of December 31, 2015, this gap was 5.0 percent, compared with 0.4 percent at December 31, 2014.\nExternal Sources of Liquidity\nFHLBank P&I Funding Contingency Plan Agreement. We have a source of emergency external liquidity through the FHLBank P&I Funding Contingency Plan Agreement. Under the terms of that agreement, in the event we do not fund our principal and interest payments under a CO by deadlines established in the agreement, the other FHLBanks will be obligated to fund any shortfall to the extent that any of the other FHLBanks have a net positive settlement balance (that is, the amount by which end-\nof-day proceeds received by such FHLBank from the sale of COs on that day exceeds payments by such FHLBank on COs on the same day) in its account with the Office of Finance on the day the shortfall occurs. We would then be required to repay the funding FHLBanks. We have never drawn funding under this agreement.\nDebt Financing - Consolidated Obligations\nOur primary source of liquidity is through CO issuances. At December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, outstanding COs, including both CO bonds and CO discount notes, totaled $53.9 billion and $50.8 billion, respectively. CO bonds are generally issued with either fixed-rate coupon-payment terms or variable-rate coupon-payment terms that use a variety of indices for interest-rate resets. Some of the fixed-rate bonds that we have issued are callable bonds that may be redeemed at par on one or more dates prior to their maturity date. In addition, to meet our needs and the needs of certain investors in COs, fixed- and variable-rate bonds may also contain certain provisions that may result in complex coupon-payment terms and call or amortization features. When such COs (structured bonds) are issued, we enter into interest-rate-exchange agreements containing offsetting features, which effectively change the characteristics of the bond to those of a simple variable-rate bond.\nThe Office of Finance has established a methodology for the allocation of the proceeds from the issuance of COs when COs cannot be issued in sufficient amounts to satisfy all FHLBank demand for funding during periods of financial distress and when its existing allocation processes are deemed insufficient. See Item 1 -Business - Consolidated Obligations for additional information on the methodology.\nIn general, this methodology provides that the proceeds in such circumstances will be allocated among the FHLBanks based on relative FHLBank total regulatory capital, with FHLBanks with greater total regulatory capital in absolute terms receiving greater allocations of issuance proceeds. The Office of Finance will use this method in such periods unless it determines that there is an overwhelming reason to adopt a different allocation method. As is the case during any instance of a disruption in our ability to access the capital markets, market conditions or this allocation could adversely impact our ability to finance our operations, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nSee Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 13 - Consolidated Obligations for a summary of CO bonds by contractual maturity dates and call dates as of December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014. CO bonds outstanding for which we are primarily liable at December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, include issued callable bonds totaling $3.6 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.\nCO discount notes are also a significant funding source for us. CO discount notes are short-term instruments with maturities ranging from overnight to one year. We use CO discount notes primarily to fund short-term advances and investments, and longer-term advances and investments with short repricing intervals. CO discount notes comprised 52.8 percent and 49.8 percent of the outstanding COs for which we are primarily liable at December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively, but accounted for 92.3 percent and 91.4 percent of the proceeds from the issuance of such COs during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe table below shows our short-term borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CO Discount Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CO Bonds with Original Maturities of One Year or Less\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding par amount at end of the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,487,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,312,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,062,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,068,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,722,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,196,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average rate at the end of the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Daily-average par amount outstanding for the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,243,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,697,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,106,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,784,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,629,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,445,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average rate for the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Highest par amount outstanding at any month-end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,487,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,062,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,072,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,495,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,525,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we are primarily liable for our portion of COs, that is, those issued on our behalf, we are also jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on COs issued by all of the FHLBanks. The par amounts of the FHLBanks' outstanding COs were $905.2 billion and $847.2 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. COs are backed only by the combined financial resources of the FHLBanks. COs are not obligations of the U.S. government, and the U.S. government does not guarantee them. We have never paid any obligations on behalf of the other FHLBanks.\nWe have evaluated the financial condition of the other FHLBanks based on known regulatory actions, publicly available financial information, and individual long-term credit rating downgrades as of each period presented. Based on this evaluation, as of December 31, 2015, and through the filing of this report, we believe there is a remote likelihood that we will be required to repay the principal or interest on any CO on behalf of another FHLBank.\nThe FHLBank Act authorizes the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, at his or her discretion, to purchase COs of the FHLBanks aggregating not more than $4.0 billion under certain conditions. The terms, conditions, and interest rates are determined by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. There were no such purchases by the U.S. Treasury during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor additional information on COs, including their issuance, see Item 1 - Business - Consolidated Obligations.\nFinancial Conditions for Consolidated Obligations\nWe continue to operate in a prolonged, historically low interest-rate environment as discussed under Economic Conditions - Interest-Rate Environment. Overall, we have experienced relatively low CO issuance costs during the period covered by this report, reflecting the low interest-rate environment together with continuing investor preferences for low-risk investments. We have experienced good market demand for all tenors of COs with the strongest demand for short-term COs, and have been able to issue debt in the amounts and structures required to meet our funding and risk-management needs. During the period covered by this report, we experienced some increase in relative CO issuance costs as compared to yields in U.S. dollar interest rate swaps, particularly during a period of global market turbulence. However, investor demand for COs during the period remained strong and stable impacted in part by growing institutional investor demand for COs. We note that capacity among our CO underwriters has been occasionally somewhat constrained as a result of the imposition of new capital requirements on underwriters. So far, this development has not impeded our ability to meet our funding needs.\nCapital\nTotal capital at December 31, 2015, was $3.0 billion compared with $2.9 billion at year-end 2014.\nCapital stock declined by $76.5 million due to the repurchase of $602.1 million of excess capital stock (of which $256.7 million was mandatorily redeemable capital stock) and the reclassification of capital stock to mandatorily redeemable capital stock amounting to $54,000. Offsetting these decreases was the issuance of $269.1 million of capital stock.\nThe FHLBank Act and FHFA regulations specify that each FHLBank is required to satisfy certain minimum regulatory capital requirements. We were in compliance with these requirements at December 31, 2015, as discussed in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 15 - Capital.\nOur membership includes commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, insurance companies, and community development financial institutions with capital stock outstanding by member type shown in the table below (dollars in thousands).\nTable 188: <table><tr><td>Capital Stock Outstanding by\nMember Type\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thrift institutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,108,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial banks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>732,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit unions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Community development financial institutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total GAAP capital stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,336,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily redeemable capital stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total regulatory capital stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,378,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital stock subject to a stock redemption period is reclassified to mandatorily redeemable capital stock in the liability section of the statement of condition.

For additional information on the redemption of our capital stock, see Item 1 - Business - Capital Resources - Redemption of Excess Stock and Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock.\nWe have the authority, but are not obliged, to repurchase excess stock, as discussed under Item 1 - Business - Capital Resources - Repurchase of Excess Stock.

An FHLBank is adequately capitalized if it has sufficient permanent and total capital to meet or exceed its risk-based and minimum capital requirements. FHLBanks that are adequately capitalized have no corrective action requirements. FHLBanks that are not adequately capitalized must submit capital restoration plans, are subject to corrective action requirements and are prohibited from paying dividends, redeeming or repurchasing excess stock, and subject to certain asset growth restrictions. The FHFA may place critically undercapitalized FHLBanks into conservatorship or receivership.\nThe Director of the FHFA has discretion to add to or modify the corrective action requirements for each capital classification other than adequately capitalized if the Director of the FHFA determines that such action is necessary to ensure the safe and sound operation of the FHLBank and the FHLBank's compliance with its risk-based and minimum capital requirements.\nIf we became classified into a capital classification other than adequately capitalized, we could be adversely impacted by the corrective action requirements for that capital classification.\nThe Capital Rule requires the Director of the FHFA to determine on no less than a quarterly basis the capital classification of each FHLBank. By letter dated December 10, 2015, the Director of the FHFA notified us that, based on September 30, 2015 financial information, we met the definition of adequately capitalized under the Capital Rule. We have not yet received our capital classification based on our December 31, 2015, financial information.\nInternal Capital Practices and Policies\nWe also take steps as we believe prudent beyond legal or regulatory requirements in an effort to protect our capital, reflected in our targeted capital ratio operating range, internal minimum capital requirement in excess of regulatory requirements, minimum retained earnings target, and limitations on dividends.\nTargeted Capital Ratio Operating Range\nWe target an operating capital ratio range as required by FHFA regulations. Currently, this range is set at 4.0 percent to 7.5 percent. Our capital ratio was 6.0 percent at December 31, 2015.\nInternal Minimum Capital Requirement in Excess of Regulatory Requirements\nTo provide further protection for our capital base, we maintain an internal minimum capital requirement whereby the amount of paid-in capital stock and retained earnings (together, our actual regulatory capital) must exceed four percent of our total assets plus an amount we measure as our risk exposure with 99 percent confidence using our economic capital model (together, our internal minimum capital requirement). As of December 31, 2015, this internal minimum capital requirement equaled $2.9 billion, which was satisfied by our actual regulatory capital of $3.5 billion.\nRetained Earnings and the Minimum Retained Earnings Target\nAt December 31, 2015, we had total retained earnings of $1.1 billion compared with our minimum retained earnings target of $700.0 million. We generally view our minimum retained earnings target as a floor for retained earnings rather than as a retained earnings limit and expect to continue to grow our retained earnings even though we exceed the target.\nOur methodology for determining retained earnings adequacy and selection of the minimum retained earnings target incorporates an assessment of the various risks that could adversely impact retained earnings if trigger stress-scenario conditions were to occur. Principal elements are market risk and credit risk. Market risk is represented through the Bank's established limit for Value at Risk (VaR) market-risk measurement, which estimates the 99th percentile worst case of potential changes in our market value of equity due to potential shifts in yield curves applicable to our assets, liabilities, and off-balance-sheet transactions. Credit risk is represented through incorporation of valuation deterioration due but not limited to actual and potential adverse ratings migrations for our assets and actual and potential defaults.\nOur minimum retained earnings target could be superseded by FHFA mandates, either in the form of an order specific to us or by promulgation of new regulations requiring a level of retained earnings that is different from our current target. Moreover, we may, at any time, change our methodology or assumptions for modeling our minimum retained earnings target and will do so when prudential or other reasons warrant such a change. Either of these events could result in us increasing our minimum retained earnings target and, in turn, reducing or eliminating dividends, as necessary.\nFor information on limitations on dividends, including limitations when we are under our minimum retained earnings target, see Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nExcess Stock Management Program\nWe used the Excess Stock Management program on October 1, 2015, to unilaterally repurchase $310.2 million of excess stock from shareholders on a pro rata basis and expect to continue to use the program in 2016 as necessary to keep the amount of excess stock between zero and $200 million.\nRestricted Retained Earnings and the Joint Capital Agreement\nAt December 31, 2015, our total retained earnings included $194.6 million in restricted retained earnings. Our capital plan and the Joint Capital Agreement require us to allocate a certain percentage of quarterly net income to a restricted retained earnings account, which we refer to as restricted retained earnings, in accordance with the Joint Capital Agreement. The Joint Capital Agreement is a voluntary capital initiative among the FHLBanks intended to build greater safety and soundness in the FHLBank System. Generally, the agreement requires each FHLBank to allocate an amount at least equal to 20 percent of its quarterly net income (net of that FHLBank's obligation to its Affordable Housing Program) to a restricted retained earnings account until the total amount in that account is equal to 1 percent of the daily average carrying value of that FHLBank's outstanding total COs (excluding fair-value adjustments) for the calendar quarter (total required contribution). The FHLBanks\ncommenced this obligation with their results at September 30, 2011. The percentage of the required allocation is subject to adjustment when an FHLBank has had an adjustment to a prior calendar quarter's net income.

Although management believes these judgments, estimates, and assumptions to be reasonably accurate, actual results may differ.\nWe have identified five accounting estimates that we believe are critical because they require us to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These estimates include accounting for derivatives, the use of fair-value estimates, accounting for deferred premiums and discounts on prepayable assets, the allowance for loan losses, and other-than-temporary-impairment of investment securities. The Audit Committee of our board of directors has reviewed these estimates.\nAccounting for Derivatives\nDerivatives are required to be carried at fair value on the statement of condition. Any change in the fair value of a derivative is required to be recorded each period in current period earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the type of hedge transaction. All of our derivatives are either 1) inherent to another activity, such as forward commitments to purchase mortgage loans under the MPF program, 2) embedded in a host financial instrument, such as an advance or an investment security, or 3) derivative contracts structured to offset some or all of the risk exposure inherent in our member-lending, investment, and funding activities. We are required to recognize unrealized losses or gains on derivative positions, regardless of whether offsetting gains or losses on the associated assets or liabilities being hedged are permitted to be recognized in a symmetrical manner. Therefore, the accounting framework imposed can introduce the potential for considerable income variability. Specifically, a mismatch can exist between the timing of income and expense recognition from assets or liabilities and the income effects of derivatives positioned to mitigate market-risk and cash-flow variability. Therefore, during periods of significant changes in interest rates and other market factors, our reported earnings may exhibit considerable variability. We generally employ hedging techniques that are effective under the hedge-accounting requirements. However, not all of our hedging relationships meet the hedge-accounting requirements. In some cases, we have elected to retain or enter into derivatives that are economically effective at reducing risk but do not meet the hedge-accounting requirements, either because the cost of the hedge was economically superior to nonderivative hedging alternatives or because no nonderivative hedging alternative was available, and available derivatives did not meet hedge accounting requirements. As required by FHFA regulation and our policy, derivatives that do not qualify as hedging instruments pursuant to GAAP may be used only if we document a nonspeculative purpose.\nA hedging relationship is created from the designation of a derivative financial instrument as either hedging our exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or unrecognized firm commitment, or changes in future variable cash flows attributable to a recognized asset or liability or forecasted transaction. Fair-value hedge accounting allows for the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk in the hedged item to also be recorded in current period earnings.\nThe short-cut method can be used when the assumption can be made that the change in fair value of a hedged item, due to changes in the benchmark rate, exactly offsets the change in fair value of the related derivative. In many hedging relationships that use the short-cut method, we may designate the hedging relationship upon our commitment to disburse an advance or trade a CO provided that the period of time between the trade date and the settlement date of the hedged item is within established market-settlement conventions for the advances and CO markets. We define these market-settlement conventions to be five business days or less for advances and 30 calendar days or less, using a next business day convention, for COs. In such circumstances, although the advance or CO will not be recognized in the financial statements until settlement date, the hedge relationship qualifies for applying the short-cut method. We then record changes in the fair value of the derivative and hedged item beginning on the trade date.\nBeginning in November 2014, to streamline certain operational processes, we voluntarily discontinued the use of short-cut hedge accounting for new hedge relationships entered into after that date. Short-cut hedge relationships entered into prior to that date will continue as short-cut hedge relationships until they mature or are terminated.\nHedge relationships not treated as short-cut accounting are treated as a long-haul fair-value hedge, where the change in the value of the hedged item attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate must be measured separately from the derivative and effectiveness testing must be performed with results falling within established tolerances. If the hedge fails its effectiveness test, the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and the derivative is marked through current-period earnings without any offset related to the hedged item.\nFor derivative transactions that potentially qualify for long-haul fair-value hedge-accounting treatment, management must assess how effective the derivatives have been, and are expected to be, in hedging changes in the estimated fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risks being hedged. Hedge-effectiveness testing is performed at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. We perform testing at hedge inception based on regression analysis of the hypothetical performance of the hedge relationship using historical market data. We then perform regression testing on an ongoing basis using accumulated actual values in conjunction with hypothetical values. Specifically, each month we use a consistently applied statistical methodology that uses a sample of at least 31 historical interest-rate environments and includes an R-square test, a slope test, and an F-statistic test. These tests measure the degree of correlation of movements in estimated fair values between the derivative and the related hedged item. For the hedging relationship to be considered effective, the R-square must be greater than 0.8, the slope must be between -0.8 and -1.25, and the computed F-statistic test significance must be less than 0.05.\nWe use the overnight-index swap curve for valuation of our interest-rate derivatives in which the recipient of collateral maintains the right to rehypothecate pledged collateral, while LIBOR is used as the discount rate for interest-rate derivatives in which the recipient of collateral has no right to rehypothecate pledged collateral. Additionally, we use the overnight-index swap curve as the discount rate for derivatives cleared through a DCO.\nWe use the LIBOR swap curve to discount cash flows on all associated hedged assets or liabilities in fair-value hedging relationships where the hedged risk is changes in fair value attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate, LIBOR. For any such hedging relationship where the valuation of the derivative transaction is based on the overnight-index swap curve, there could be an increase in hedge ineffectiveness that in turn could result in the loss of hedge accounting for certain hedge relationships. Loss of hedge accounting for those hedge relationships would lead to increased net income volatility, which could be material. However, through December 31, 2015, no hedge relationships failed our hedge effectiveness criteria as a result of using the overnight-index swap curve as the discount rate for the derivative and the LIBOR swap curve as the discount rate for the hedged item.\nThe fair values of the derivatives and hedged items do not have any cumulative economic effect if the derivative and the hedged item are held to maturity, or mutual optional termination at par. Since these fair values fluctuate throughout the hedge period and eventually return to par value on the maturity date, the effect of fair values is normally only a timing issue.\nFor derivatives and hedged items that meet the requirements described above, we do not anticipate any significant impact on our financial condition or operating performance. For derivatives where no identified hedged item qualifies for hedge accounting, changes in the market value of the derivative are reflected in earnings. As of December 31, 2015, we held derivatives that are marked to market with no offsetting qualifying hedged item including $300.0 million notional of interest-rate caps, $562.5 million notional of interest-rate swaps, and $24.7 million notional of mortgage-delivery commitments. The\ntotal fair value of these positions as of December 31, 2015, was an unrealized loss of $15.7 million. The following table shows the estimated changes in the fair value of these derivatives under alternative parallel interest-rate shifts:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td>Estimated Change in Fair Value of Undesignated Derivatives\nAs of December 31, 2015\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+50 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+100 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change from base case\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-rate caps and swaps(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Given the low interest-rate environment experienced at the end of 2015, we do not believe that technical valuations generated through a down 100 basis point and a down 50 basis point rate shock are representative of potential shifts in the instruments' values.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese derivatives economically hedge certain advances, investment securities, and CO bonds. Although these economic hedges do not qualify or were not designated for hedge accounting, they are an acceptable hedging strategy under our risk-management program. Our projections of changes in value of the derivatives have been consistent with actual experience.\nFair-Value Estimates\nOverview. We measure certain assets and liabilities, including investment securities classified as available-for-sale and trading, as well as all derivatives and mandatorily redeemable capital stock at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, certain held-to-maturity securities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis due to the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment. Management also estimates the fair value of some of the collateral that borrowers pledge against advance borrowings to confirm that collateral is sufficient to meet regulatory requirements and to protect against losses. Accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair-value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value, and requires certain disclosures for fair-value measurements. The book values and fair values of our financial assets and liabilities, along with a description of the valuation techniques used to determine the fair values of these financial instruments, is disclosed in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 18 - Fair Values.\nWe generally consider a market to be inactive if the following conditions exist: (1) there are few transactions for the financial instruments; (2) the prices in the market are not current; (3) the price quotes we receive vary significantly either over time or among independent pricing services or dealers; and (4) there is a limited availability of public market information.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. In general, the transaction price will equal the exit price and, therefore, represent the fair value of the asset or liability at initial recognition. In determining whether a transaction price represents the fair value of the asset or liability at initial recognition, each reporting entity is required to consider factors specific to the transaction and the asset or liability. To determine the fair value or the exit price, entities must determine the unit of account, principal market, market participants, and for non-financial instruments the highest and best use. These determinations allow the reporting entity to define the inputs for fair value and level of hierarchy.\nFair values are based on quoted market prices or market-based prices, if such prices are available. If quoted market prices or market-based prices are not available, fair values are determined based on valuation models that use either:\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>discounted cash flows, using market estimates of interest rates and volatility; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>dealer prices and prices of similar instruments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPricing models and their underlying assumptions are based on management's best estimate with respect to:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>discount rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>prepayments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>market volatility; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other factors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and the income and expense related thereto. The use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in materially different net income and retained earnings.\nAccounting guidance establishes a three-level fair-value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments that is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The three levels of the fair-value hierarchy are:\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2 - Observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3 - Unobservable inputs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEach asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair-value measurement. The majority of our financial instruments carried at fair value fall within the Level 2 category and is valued primarily using inputs and assumptions that are observable in the market, can be derived from observable market data, or can be corroborated by recent trading activity of similar instruments with similar characteristics.\nThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that are actively traded and have quoted market prices or parameters readily available, there is little to no subjectivity in determining fair value.\nValuation of Derivatives and Hedged Items. For purposes of estimating the fair value of derivatives and items for which we are hedging the changes in fair value attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate, we employ a valuation model that uses market data from the Eurodollar futures, cash LIBOR, U.S. Treasury obligations, and the U.S. dollar interest-rate-swap markets to construct discount and forward-yield curves using standard financial market techniques.\nAs discussed under - Accounting for Derivatives, OIS is used as the discount rate for valuation of our uncleared derivatives in which the recipient of collateral maintains the right to rehypothecate pledged collateral and for all derivatives cleared through a DCO, while LIBOR continues to be the appropriate discount rate for uncleared derivatives in which the recipient of collateral has no right to rehypothecate pledged collateral.\nThe valuation adjustments for our hedged items in which the designated hedged risk is the risk of changes in fair value attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR-based) are calculated using the same model that calculates the fair values of the associated hedging derivatives.\nValuation of Investment Securities. To ensure consistency in determining investment securities values, including the other-than-temporary impairment for private-label residential MBS and certain home equity loan investments (including home equity ABS) among the FHLBanks, the FHLBanks formed a pricing committee (the Pricing Committee) and established a formal process for key other-than-temporary impairment modeling assumptions used for cash-flow analyses for the majority of these securities. As a voting member, we provide input into the procedures considered by the Pricing Committee in determining fair values, and vote to adopt amendments to the procedures from time to time. We participate in the Pricing Committee as an important part of our continuing efforts to refine the valuation procedures for our investment securities and to enhance consistency among the FHLBanks on certain investment securities' valuation determinations.\nFor the period ended December 31, 2015, we employed the procedures to value our MBS that have been established by the Pricing Committee and also applied those procedures to value our non-MBS investments with the exception of floating-rate HFA securities. We have reviewed the Pricing Committee's procedures and determined that they are reasonably designed to determine that the estimated prices were exit prices. Accordingly, the following descriptions of our procedures for the period ended December 31, 2015, are the same as those established by the Pricing Committee. These processes are described in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 18 - Fair Values - Investment Securities.\nThe four designated and market-recognized pricing vendors from whom we collected prices used various proprietary models. The inputs to those models were derived from various sources including, but not limited to, benchmark yields, reported trades, dealer indications, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and other market-related data. Since many private-label MBS (and to a lesser extent other investment securities) do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing vendors used available information such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing to determine the\nprices for individual securities. Each pricing vendor has an established challenge process in place for all securities valuations, which facilitates resolution of potentially erroneous prices as identified by our methodology.\nFor the period ended December 31, 2015, we conducted reviews of the four pricing vendors to confirm and further augment our understanding of the vendors' pricing processes, methodologies, and control procedures. To the extent available, we also reviewed the vendors' independent auditors' reports regarding the internal controls over their valuation processes.\nOur valuation technique first requires the establishment of a median price\u201d for each security using a formula that is based upon the number of vendor prices received:\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>If four prices are received, the middle two prices are averaged to establish a median price;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>if three prices are received, the middle price is the median price;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>if two prices are received, the prices are averaged to establish a median price; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>if one price is received, it is the median price (and also the final price), subject to further validation, consistent with the evaluation of outliers\u201d as discussed below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the cases where two or more vendor prices are obtained, each vendor price is compared to the median price defined above. Differences between all vendor prices received and the median price are then compared to the security's applicable tolerance parameters. All vendor prices that are within the security's tolerance parameters are averaged to arrive at the security's default price. In cases where one or more vendor prices have differences greater than the applicable tolerance parameter, these out-of-tolerance prices (the outliers) are subject to further analysis. Further analysis to exclude a vendor price or to determine if an outlier is a better estimate of fair value includes, but is not limited to, comparison to i) prices provided by a fifth, third-party recognized valuation service, ii) observed market prices for similar securities, iii) nonbinding dealer estimates, or iv) use of internal model prices, which we believe generally reflect the relevant facts and circumstances that a market participant would consider. Additionally, we ordinarily challenge a pricing vendor when a price falls outside of the tolerance parameters and/or if we determine that a price should be excluded as a result of our further analysis. When a pricing vendor agrees that its price is incorrect, we exclude that price from our determination of that security's final price. When a pricing vendor disagrees that its price is incorrect, our internal subject matter experts determine whether or not to consider that price in the determination of that security's final price in the valuation process based on all information available to the subject matter experts. In the case where management determines an outlier price is more representative of the security's price, then the outlier price will be used as the final price rather than the default price. If, on the other hand, management determines that an outlier (or outliers) is (are) in fact not representative of fair value, then the outlier(s) will be excluded from the default price calculation, and the default price is then used as the final price. In all cases, the final price is used to determine the fair value of the security.\nAs of December 31, 2015, four vendor prices were received for 96.1 percent of our investment securities and the final prices for substantially all of those securities were computed by averaging the four prices. Based on our review of the pricing methods and controls employed by the third-party pricing vendors and the relative lack of dispersion among the vendor prices (or, in those instances in which there were outliers or significant yield variances, our additional analyses), we believe the final prices used are reasonably likely to be exit prices and further that the fair-value measurements are classified appropriately in the fair-value hierarchy.\nDeferred Premium/Discount Associated with Prepayable Mortgage-Backed Securities\nWhen we purchase MBS, we often pay an amount that is different than the unpaid principal balance. The difference between the purchase price and the contractual note amount is a premium if the purchase price is higher, and a discount if the purchase price is lower. Accounting guidance permits us to amortize (or accrete) these premiums (or discounts) in a manner such that the yield recognized on the underlying asset is constant over the asset's estimated life.\nWe typically pay more than the unpaid principal balances when the interest rates on the purchased mortgages are greater than prevailing market rates for similar mortgages on the transaction date. The net purchase premiums paid are then amortized using the constant-effective-yield method over the expected lives of the mortgages as a reduction in their book yields (that is, interest income). Similarly, if we pay less than the unpaid principal balances due to interest rates on the purchased mortgages being lower than prevailing market rates on similar mortgages on the transaction date, the net discount is accreted in the same manner as the premiums, resulting in an increase in the mortgages' book yields. The constant-effective-yield amortization method is applied using expected cash flows that incorporate prepayment projections that are based on mathematical models that describe the likely rate of consumer refinancing activity in response to incentives created (or removed) by changes in interest rates. While changes in interest rates have the greatest effect on the extent to which mortgages may prepay, in general prepayment behavior can also be affected by factors not contingent on interest rates. Generally, however, when interest rates decline,\nprepayment speeds are likely to increase, which accelerates the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts. The opposite occurs when interest rates rise.\nWe estimate prepayment speeds on each individual security using the most recent three months of historical constant prepayment rates, as available, or may subscribe to third-party data services that provide estimates of cash flows, from which we determine expected asset lives. The constant-effective-yield method uses actual historical prepayments received and projected future prepayment speeds, as well as scheduled principal payments, to determine the amount of premium/discount that should be recognized so that the book yield of each MBS is constant for each month until maturity.\nIn general, lower interest rates are expected to result in the acceleration of premium and discount amortization and accretion, compared with the effect of higher interest rates that would tend to decelerate the amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts. Exact trends will depend on the relationship between market interest rates and coupon rates on outstanding mortgage assets, the historical evolution of mortgage interest rates, the age of the mortgage loans, demographic and population trends, and other market factors. Changes in amortization will also depend on the accuracy of prepayment projections compared with actual experience. Prepayment projections are inherently subject to uncertainty because it is difficult to accurately predict future market conditions and the response of borrowing consumers in terms of refinancing activity to future market conditions even if the market conditions were known. However, actual prepayment speeds observed in these rate environments can be influenced by factors such as home price trends and lender credit underwriting standards. For example, in the recent very-low interest-rate environment, borrower refinancing activity has generally been lower than models would have predicted based on experience prior to the housing recession that commenced in 2008.\nIf we determine that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, we account for the investment security as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the other-than-temporary impairment at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis reduced by the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in income. The difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is amortized or accreted into interest income prospectively over the remaining life of the investment security based on the amount and timing of future estimated cash flows.\nUpon subsequent evaluation of a debt security where there is no additional other-than-temporary impairment, we adjust the accretable yield on a prospective basis if there is a significant increase in the security's expected cash flows. The new accretable yield is used to calculate the amount to be recognized into income over the remaining life of the security so as to match the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected. The estimated cash flows and accretable yield are re-evaluated on a quarterly basis.\nThe effect on interest income from the amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts on MBS, including MBS in both the held-to-maturity and available-for-sale portfolios and including accretion associated with a significant increase in a security's expected cash flows, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, was a net increase to income of $19.5 million, $16.7 million, and $10.4 million, respectively.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nAdvances. We have experienced no credit losses on advances and currently do not anticipate any credit losses on advances for the reasons discussed under - Financial Condition - Advances Credit Risk. Accordingly, we make no allowance for losses on advances.\nAt December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, we had rights to collateral, either loans or securities, on a member-by-member basis, with an estimated fair value in excess of outstanding advances. We believe that policies and procedures are in place to appropriately manage the credit risk associated with advances.\nMortgage Loans. We invest in both conventional mortgage loans and government mortgage loans under the MPF program. We have determined that no allowance for losses is necessary for government mortgage loans, as discussed under Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 10 - Allowance for Credit Losses. Conventional loans, in addition to having the related real estate as collateral, are credit enhanced either by qualified collateral pledged by the member, or by supplemental mortgage insurance purchased by the member. The credit enhancement is the participating financial institution's potential loss in the second-loss position after the first loss account is exhausted. We incur all losses in excess of the credit enhancement.\nAs of December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, the allowance for loan losses on the conventional mortgage loan portfolio was $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The allowance reflects our estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the MPF portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOur allowance for loan-losses methodology estimates the amount of probable incurred losses that are inherent in the portfolio, but have not yet been realized. We then apply the risk-mitigating features of the MPF program to the estimated loss, which can include primary mortgage insurance, supplemental mortgage insurance, member-provided credit enhancements (described below), and any other credit enhancement. The credit enhancement represents the participating financial institution's continuing obligation to absorb a portion of the credit losses arising from the participating financial institution's master commitment(s). Additionally, certain credit-enhancement fees can be withheld from the participating financial institution to mitigate losses from our investments in MPF loans and therefore we consider our expectations by each master commitment for such withheld fees in determining the allowance for loan losses. More specifically the amount of credit-enhancement fees available to mitigate losses is calculated by adding accrued credit-enhancement fees to be paid to participating financial institutions and projected credit-enhancement fees to be paid to the participating financial institutions over the remaining estimated life of the master commitment and then subtracting any losses incurred or expected to be incurred.\nFor additional information on the allowance for loan losses, see Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 10 - Allowance for Credit Losses.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities\nWe evaluate held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of the end of each quarter for other-than-temporary impairment. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we assess whether (a) we have the intent to sell the debt security, or (b) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. If either of these conditions is met, an other-than-temporary impairment on the security must be recognized. Further, if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected (discounted at the security's effective yield) is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred because the entire amortized cost basis of the security will not be recovered.\nThese evaluations are inherently subjective and consider a number of qualitative factors. In addition to monitoring the credit ratings of these securities for downgrades, as well as placement on negative outlook or credit watch, we evaluate other factors that may be indicative of other-than-temporary impairment. Depending on the type of security, these include, but are not limited to, an evaluation of the type of security, the length of time and extent to which the fair value of a security has been less than its cost, any credit enhancement or insurance, and certain other collateral-related characteristics such as FICO credit scores, loan-to-value ratios, delinquency and foreclosure rates, geographic concentrations, and the security's performance. If either our initial analysis identifies securities at risk of other-than-temporary impairment or the security is a private-label MBS, we perform additional testing of these investments.\nAt-risk securities and all private-label residential MBS are evaluated by estimating projected cash flows using models that incorporate projections and assumptions that are typically based on the structure of the security, existing credit enhancement, and certain economic assumptions, such as geographic housing prices, projected delinquency and default rates, expected loss severity on the collateral supporting our security, underlying loan-level borrower and loan characteristics, and prepayment speeds. The projected cash flows and losses are allocated to various security classes, including the security classes that we own, based on the cash flow and loss allocation rules of the individual security.\nWe perform our other-than-temporary impairment analysis for our private-label residential MBS using key modeling assumptions, inputs, and methodologies provided by the OTTI Governance Committee for our cash-flow projections used in analyzing credit losses and determining other-than-temporary impairment for private-label MBS. We participate in the OTTI Governance Committee, a committee that was formed by the FHLBanks to ensure consistency among the FHLBanks in their analyses of other-than-temporary impairment of private-label MBS in accordance with certain related guidance provided by the FHFA. The FHFA provides certain guidelines to the FHLBanks for determining other-than-temporary impairment with the objective of promoting consistency in the determination of other-than-temporary impairment for private-label MBS among the FHLBanks. In general terms, these guidelines provide that each FHLBank:\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>will identify the private-label MBS in its portfolio that should be subject to a cash-flow analysis consistent with GAAP and other applicable regulatory guidance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>will use the same key modeling assumptions, inputs, and methodologies as the other FHLBanks for generating the cash-flow projections used in analyzing credit losses and determining other-than-temporary impairment for private-label MBS;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>will consult with any other FHLBank that holds any common private-label MBS with it to ensure consistent results regarding the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment, including the determination of fair value and the credit-loss component, for each such security;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>is responsible for making its own determination of impairment and the reasonableness of assumptions, inputs, and methodologies used and performing the required present value calculations using appropriate historical cost bases and yields; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>may engage another FHLBank to perform the cash-flow projections underlying its other-than-temporary impairment determination.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe modeling assumptions, inputs, and methodologies for the other-than-temporary impairment analyses of our private-label residential MBS are material to the determination of other-than-temporary impairment. Accordingly, management has reviewed the assumptions approved by the OTTI Governance Committee and determined that they are reasonable. We base this view on our review of the methodology used to derive and/or formulate these assumptions by monitoring trends in the behavior of the underlying collateral and by comparison to \"most likely\" projections reported by various market observers and participants. However, any changes to the assumptions, inputs, or methodologies for the other-than-temporary impairment analyses as described in this section could result in materially different outcomes to this analysis including the realization of additional other-than-temporary impairment charges, which may be substantial.\nIn accordance with related FHFA guidance, we have contracted with the FHLBanks of San Francisco and Chicago to perform cash-flow analyses for certain of our residential private-label MBS, as described in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 7 - Other-Than-Temporary Impairment. We have tested the results of the FHLBank of San Francisco and the FHLBank of Chicago cash-flow modeling based on our internal modeling and determined that these results are reasonable. For each of these analyses, third-party models are employed to project expected losses associated with the underlying loan collateral and to model the resultant lifetime cash flows as to how they would pass through the deal structures underlying our MBS investments. These models use expected borrower default rates, projected loss severities, and forecasted voluntary prepayment speeds, all tailored to individual security product type. These analyses are based on the expected behavior of the underlying loans, whereby these loan-performance scenarios are applied against each security's credit-support structure to monitor credit-enhancement sufficiency to protect our investment. Model output includes projected cash flows, including any shortfalls in the capacity of the underlying collateral in conjunction with credit enhancements to fully return all contractual cash flows.\nWe own certain private-label MBS that are insured by third-party bond insurers (referred to as monoline insurers). The bond insurance on these investments guarantees the timely payments of principal and interest if these payments cannot be satisfied from the cash flows of the underlying mortgage pool. The cash-flow analysis of the MBS protected by such third-party insurance looks first to the performance of the underlying security, considering its embedded credit enhancement(s), which may be in the form of excess spread, overcollateralization, and/or credit subordination to determine the collectability of all amounts due. If these protections are deemed insufficient to make timely payment of all amounts due, then we consider the capacity of the third-party bond insurer to cover any shortfalls. Certain monoline insurers have been subject to adverse ratings, rating downgrades, and weakening financial performance measures. Accordingly, we have performed analyses to assess the financial strength of these monoline insurers to establish an expected case regarding the time horizon of the bond insurers' ability to fulfill their financial obligations and provide credit support. The projected time horizon of credit protection provided by an insurer is a function of claim-paying resources and anticipated claims in the future. If less than full insurance coverage is expected, the projection is referred to as the burn-out period and is expressed in months. The burn-out period for those monoline insurers is incorporated in the third-party cash-flow model as a key input. Any cash-flow shortfalls that occurred beyond the end of the burn-out period were considered not recoverable and the insured security was then deemed to be credit-impaired.\nIn instances in which a determination is made that a credit loss exists (defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security's effective yield, and the amortized cost basis, but limited to the difference between amortized cost and fair value of the security), but we do not intend to sell the debt security and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the debt security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis, the impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and (b) the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors. If our cash-flow analysis results in a present value of expected cash flows that is less than the amortized cost basis of a security (that is, a credit loss exists), an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. If we determine that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, we account for the investment security as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the other-than-temporary impairment at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis reduced by the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in income. The difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is amortized or accreted into interest income prospectively over the remaining life of the investment security based on the amount and timing of future estimated cash flows.\nSee Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 7 - Other-Than-Temporary Impairment for additional information related to management's other-than-temporary impairment analysis for the current period.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nSee Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 2 - Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance for a discussion of recent accounting developments impacting or that could impact us.\nLEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS\nFHFA Final Rule on FHLBank Membership\nOn January 20, 2016, the FHFA issued a rule effective on February 19, 2016, that, among other things:\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>defines the principal place of business\u201d of an institution eligible for FHLBank membership to be the state in which it maintains its \"home office\" (as established under the laws under which the institution is organized), but only if the institution conducts business operations from its home office; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>makes captive insurance companies ineligible for FHLBank membership\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe rule defines a captive insurance company as a company that is authorized under state law to conduct an insurance business but whose primary business is not the underwriting of insurance for non-affiliated persons or entities.\nCaptive insurance company members that were admitted as FHLBank members prior to September 12, 2014 (the date the FHFA proposed this rule), will have their memberships terminated by February 18, 2021. Captive insurance company members that were admitted as FHLBank members after September 12, 2014, will have their memberships terminated by February 18, 2017. There are restrictions on the level and maturity of advances that FHLBanks can make to these members during the sunset periods.\nWe do not expect the rule to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFHFA Final Rule on Responsibilities of Boards of Directors, Corporate Practices and Corporate Governance Matters\nOn November 19, 2015, the FHFA issued a rule effective on December 21, 2015, that, among other things, require each FHLBank to:\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operate an enterprise-wide risk-management program and assign its chief risk officer certain enumerated responsibilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintain a compliance program headed by a compliance officer who reports directly to the chief executive officer and must regularly report to the board of directors (or a board committee);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintain board committees specifically responsible for risk management; audit; compensation; and corporate governance; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>designate in its bylaws a body of law to follow for its corporate governance and indemnification practices and procedures, choosing from the law of the jurisdiction in which the FHLBank maintains its principal office, the Delaware General Corporation Law; or the Revised Model Business Corporation Act. On March 18, 2016, we adopted revised bylaws which selected Massachusetts law for this purpose.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, the rule provides that the FHFA has the authority to review a regulated entity's indemnification policies, procedures, and practices to ensure that they are conducted in a safe and sound manner.\nWe do not expect this rule to materially impact our financial condition or results of operation.\nJoint Final Rule on Margin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities\nIn October 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Farm Credit Administration, and the FHFA (each an Agency and, collectively, the Agencies) jointly adopted final rules to establish minimum margin and capital requirements for registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants (Swap Entities) that are subject to\nthe jurisdiction of one of the Agencies (such entities, Covered Swap Entities, and the joint final rules, the Final Margin Rules). On January 6, 2016, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) published its own version of the Final Margin Rules that generally mirrors the Final Margin Rules. The CFTC's rules apply only to a limited number of registered swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants, and major security-based swap participants that are not subject to the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies.\nWhen they take effect, the Final Margin Rules will subject non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and Swap Entities and between Covered Swap Entities and financial end users that have material swaps exposure (i.e., an average daily aggregate notional of $8 billion or more in non-cleared swaps), to a mandatory two-way initial margin requirement. The amount of the initial margin required to be posted or collected would be either the amount calculated by the Covered Swap Entity using a standardized schedule set forth as an appendix to the Final Margin Rules, which provides the gross initial margin (as a percentage of total notional exposure) for certain asset classes, or an internal margin model of the Covered Swap Entity conforming to the requirements of the Final Margin Rules that are approved by the Agency having jurisdiction over the particular Covered Swap Entity. The Final Margin Rules specify the types of collateral that may be posted or collected as initial margin (generally, cash, certain government securities, certain liquid debt, certain equity securities, certain eligible publicly traded debt, and gold); and set forth haircuts for certain collateral asset classes. Initial margin must be segregated with an independent, third-party custodian and, generally, may not be rehypothecated, except that cash funds may be placed with a custodian bank in return for a general deposit obligation under certain specified circumstances.\nThe Final Margin Rules will require variation margin to be exchanged daily for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and Swap Entities and between Covered Swap Entities and all financial end-users (without regard to the swaps exposure of the particular financial end-user). The variation margin amount is the daily mark-to-market change in the value of the swap to the Covered Swap Entity, taking into account variation margin previously paid or collected. For non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and financial end-users, variation margin may be paid or collected in cash or non-cash collateral that is considered eligible for initial margin purposes. Variation margin is not subject to segregation with an independent, third-party custodian, and may, if permitted by contract, be rehypothecated.\nThe variation margin requirement under the Final Margin Rules will become effective for the Bank on March 1, 2017, and the initial margin requirements under the Final Margin Rules are expected to become effective for the Bank on September 1, 2020.\nWe are not a Covered Swap Entity under the Final Margin Rules. Rather, we are a financial end-user under the Final Margin Rules, and would likely have material swaps exposure when the initial margin requirements under the Final Margin Rules become effective.\nSince we are currently posting and collecting variation margin on non-cleared swaps, it is not anticipated that the variation margin requirement under the Final Margin Rules will have a material impact on our costs. However, when the initial margin requirements under the Final Margin Rules become effective, we anticipate that our cost of engaging in non-cleared swaps may increase.\nFHFA Core Mission Achievement Advisory Bulletin 2015-05\nOn July 14, 2015, the FHFA issued an advisory bulletin that provides guidance establishing a ratio by which the FHFA will assess each FHLBank's core mission achievement. Core mission achievement is determined using a ratio of primary mission assets, which includes advances and acquired member assets (mortgage loans acquired from members), to consolidated obligations. The core mission asset ratio will be calculated annually at year-end, using annual average par values.\nThe advisory bulletin provides the FHFA's expectations about the content of each FHLBank's strategic plan based on its ratio, as follows:\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>when the ratio is at least 70 percent, the strategic plan should include an assessment of the FHLBank's prospects for maintaining this level;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>when the ratio is at least 55 percent but less than 70 percent, the strategic plan should explain the FHLBank's plan to increase the ratio; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>when the ratio is below 55 percent, the strategic plan should include an explanation of the circumstances that caused the ratio to be at that level and detailed plans to increase the ratio. The advisory bulletin provides that if an FHLBank maintains a ratio below 55 percent over the course of several consecutive reviews, the FHLBank's board of directors should consider possible strategic alternatives.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary core mission achievement ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015, was 69.7 percent. We do not expect that complying with the advisory bulletin will materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nFinance Agency Proposed Rule on Acquired Member Assets\nOn December 17, 2015, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule that would amend the current Acquired Member Assets rule, which governs an FHLBank's ability to purchase and hold certain types of mortgage loans from its members. The proposed rule would allow an FHLBank to utilize its own model in lieu of a NRSRO ratings model to determine the credit rating for Acquired Member Assets loan assets and loan pools. The proposed rule would also eliminate the use of pool level insurance, such as supplemental mortgage insurance, as part of the required credit risk-sharing structure for Acquired Member Assets products; however, the FHLBanks are not currently acquiring Acquired Member Assets loans using this structure.\nIt is not possible to predict whether the proposed rule (if adopted) would have a negative impact on the volume of AMA loan assets or on our costs of operation.\nComments on the proposed rule are due on April 15, 2016.\nAmendment of FHLBank Act to Make Privately-Insured Credit Unions Eligible for FHLBank Membership\nOn December 4, 2015, President Obama signed a bill known as the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act ( FAST Act\u201d), which includes a provision that amends the FHLBank Act to allow privately insured credit unions to be eligible for FHLBank membership. The FAST Act requires privately insured credit unions to satisfy certain initial and ongoing eligibility and reporting requirements. The FHFA has indicated that it is reviewing the relevant portions of the FAST Act and that the FHLBanks should consult with the FHFA before acting on the membership application of any privately insured credit union.\nCREDIT RATING AGENCY DEVELOPMENTS\nAs of February 29, 2016, Moody's long-and short-term credit ratings for us and the 10 other FHLBanks are AAA and P-1, with a stable

Our net income increased to $289.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, the highest annual net income in the Bank's history, largely due to $184.9 million in litigation settlement income related to private-label MBS for the year. In addition, advances balances grew as discussed below. Our financial condition continued to strengthen with retained earnings growing to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015, from $901.7 million at December 31, 2014, a surplus of $428.8 million over our minimum retained earnings target, as we continue to satisfy all regulatory capital requirements as of December 31, 2015. We also provided a dividend spread of 300 basis points over the daily average three-month LIBOR. Our return on average equity was 9.54 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 5.24 percent for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 430 basis points.\nNet Interest Margin\nIn 2015, net interest margin was flat relative to the year ended December 31, 2014, at 0.41 percent. We view this as a favorable outcome in the face of the continuing very low interest-rate environment discussed under - Economic Conditions - Interest-Rate Environment.\nAdvances Balances\nWe continue to deliver on our primary mission, supplying liquidity to our members, with advances balances growing to $36.1 billion at December 31, 2015, from $33.5 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase in advances was broadly based, with long-term advances as the most significant contributor. We cannot predict whether this trend will continue.\nInvestments in Private-Label MBS\nThe amortized cost of our total investments in private-label MBS and ABS backed by home-equity loans has declined to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $6.4 billion at its peak in September 30, 2007, and other-than-temporary impairment credit losses recognized in recent periods have dropped significantly from those earlier periods.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $38.8 million and $36.0 million, respectively, in interest income resulting from the increased accretable yields of certain private-label MBS for which we had previously recognized credit losses. For a discussion of this accounting treatment, see Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Investment Securities - Other-than-Temporary Impairment - Interest Income Recognition.\nExcess Stock Management Program\nOn July 24, 2015, our board of directors authorized management to implement an excess stock management program, under which we may repurchase excess stock to maintain aggregate excess stock within a targeted range between zero and $200 million. Repurchases of excess stock have led to reductions in our capital levels, including reductions to mandatorily redeemable capital stock from $298.6 million at December 31, 2014, to $42.0 million at December 31, 2015. Dividend payments on mandatorily redeemable capital stock are classified as interest expense, so the repurchase of this stock should lead to a reduction in interest expense, all other things being equal. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock amounted to $1.6 million compared with $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRegulatory Developments\nThe FHFA and other regulators with authority over us or our way of doing business have issued or proposed multiple regulations during the year and into 2016, as described in - Legislative and Regulatory Developments. Such developments affect the way we conduct business and could impact the way we satisfy our mission as well as the value of our membership.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nEconomic Environment\nThe U.S. economy in 2015 proved resilient. Against the backdrop of a historically severe winter and economic instability overseas, the U.S. economy continued to expand.\nThe labor market continued to improve, with nonfarm payroll growth averaging over 200,000 per month for the year. At five percent in December, the unemployment rate declined 0.6 percentage point since December 2014. Alternative broader gauges of unemployment also showed steady improvement. All six of the New England states continued to see unemployment rates decline between December 2014 and 2015. Over this period, the region's unemployment rate dropped 0.7 percentage points and in December 2015 was 4.7 percent.\nThe gradual recovery in the housing market continued in 2015. The FHFA reported that house prices were up 5.8 percent in December 2015 compared to a year prior. Annual house price changes were positive for all nine census regions, reflecting a broad housing market recovery across the U.S. The housing market provided a significant boost to the New England economy in 2015, with rising prices and construction activity.\nThe U.S. and New England economies appear likely to continue to grow at a modest pace. Even though equity prices have been volatile and overseas risks appear to have heightened in early 2016, continued job gains, lower energy prices, and rising house prices look likely to support consumer spending and economic growth in 2016.\nInterest-Rate Environment\nSince 2010 and continuing into 2016, we generally have been operating in a historically low interest-rate environment, which has adversely impacted our results of operations.\nWe note that on March 16, 2016, despite having increased the targeted federal funds rate for the first time since 2006 at its December 2015 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) issued a press release providing that in light of ongoing global risks and continued low price inflation, a more accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. The statement noted that the FOMC expects economic conditions that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\nThe interest-rate environment adversely impacts our results of operations. Interest rates continue to hover close to record low levels, compressing the yields and margins that we can earn on our liquidity investments and short-term advances because our funding costs essentially have a floor of zero percent. Moreover, spreads on high-quality, interest-bearing assets in which we invest remain low relative to the yields at which we can issue comparable term debt.\nThe following chart illustrates the interest-rate environment.\nThe federal funds target rate has remained constant at zero to 0.25 percent during the time periods from the fourth quarter 2014 through the third quarter 2015. On December 17, 2015, the FOMC had raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 0.25 to 0.50 percent.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015, versus the year ended December 31, 2014\nNet income increased to $289.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The reasons for the increase are discussed under - Executive Summary.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses for the year ending December 31, 2015, was $226.0 million, compared with $213.2 million for 2014. The $12.8 million increase in net interest income after provision for credit losses was attributable to a $3.5 billion increase in average earning assets, from $51.7 billion for 2014, to $55.2 billion for 2015. The increase in average earning assets was driven by a $2.3 billion increase in average advances balances and a $1.0 billion increase in average investments balances. For additional information see - Rate and Volume Analysis. Additional increases to net interest income included a $7.2 million reduction of interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock and a $2.8 million increase in accretion of discount on securities that were other-than-temporarily impaired in prior periods, but for which a significant improvement in projected cash flows has subsequently been recognized. Offsetting these increases was a $2.2 million decrease in net prepayment fees from investments and advances from $10.5 million in the year ending December 31, 2014, to $8.3 million in the year ending December 31, 2015.\nNet interest spread was 0.37 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015, a one basis point increase from 2014, and net interest margin was 0.41 percent, unchanged from 2014. The increase in net interest spread reflects a two basis point decrease in the average yield on earning assets and a three basis point decrease in the average yield on interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe following table presents major categories of average balances, related interest income/expense, and average yields for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our primary source of earnings is net interest income, which is the interest earned on advances, mortgage loans, and investments less interest paid on COs, deposits, and other sources of funds.\n\n_________________________\n (1) The average balances of held-to-maturity securities and available-for-sale securities are reflected at amortized cost; therefore the resulting yields do not give effect to changes in fair value or the noncredit component of a previously recognized other-than-temporary impairment reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. \nRate and Volume Analysis\nChanges in both average balances (volume) and interest rates influence changes in net interest income and net interest margin. The following table summarizes changes in interest income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Changes in interest income and interest expense that are not identifiable as either volume-related or rate-related, but are equally attributable to both volume and rate changes, have been allocated to the volume and rate categories based upon the proportion of the absolute value of the volume and rate changes.\n\nAverage Balance of Advances Outstanding\nThe average balance of total advances increased $2.3 billion, or 7.7 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period in 2014. We experienced a broadly based rise in advances balances during the year with long-term advances as the most significant contributor. We cannot predict whether this trend will continue. The following table summarizes average balances of advances outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 by product type.\n\n_____________________\n (1) Includes floating-rate advances that may be contractually prepaid by the borrower on a floating-rate reset date without incurring prepayment or termination fees. \nIn addition, the average balance of fixed-rate advances that were hedged with interest-rate swaps to yield an effective floating rate totaled $6.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Therefore, a significant portion of our advances, including overnight advances, short-term fixed-rate advances, fixed-rate putable advances, certain fixed-rate bullet advances, and variable-rate advances, either earn a short-term interest rate or are swapped to a short-term index, resulting in yields that closely follow short-term market interest-rate trends. The average balance of all such advances totaled $22.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing 69.0 percent of the total average balance of advances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2015. The average balance of all such advances totaled $20.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing 66.9 percent of the total average balance of advances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, net prepayment fees on advances and investments were $8.3 million and $10.5 million, respectively. Prepayment-fee income is unpredictable and inconsistent from period to period, occurring only when advances and investments are prepaid prior to the scheduled maturity or repricing dates, and generally when prevailing reinvestment yields are lower than those of the prepaid advances.\nAverage Balance of Investments\nAverage short-term money-market investments, consisting of interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold, increased $591.4 million, or 6.2 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period in 2014. The yield earned on short-term money-market investments is highly correlated to short-term market interest rates. These investments are used for liquidity management and to manage our leverage ratio in response to fluctuations in other asset balances. We have increased these investments principally in response to growth in our advances balances to maintain the level of our contingency liquidity. For the year ended December 31, 2015, average balances of federal funds sold increased $790.4 million and average balances of securities purchased under agreements to resell decreased $224.0 million in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAverage investment-securities balances increased $450.9 million, or 5.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period in 2014, an increase consisting primarily of a $581.3 million increase in MBS offset by a $124.9 million decline in agency and supranational institutions' debentures.\nAverage Balance of COs\nAverage CO balances increased $4.1 billion, or 8.7 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period in 2014, resulting from our increased funding needs principally due to the increase in our average advances balances and short-term money-market investment balances. This overall increase consisted of an increase of $2.5 billion in CO discount notes and an increase of $1.6 billion in CO bonds.\nThe average balance of CO discount notes represented approximately 49.2 percent of total average COs during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 48.1 percent of total average COs during the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of CO bonds represented 50.8 percent and 51.9 percent of total average COs outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The proportional growth in average CO discount notes was slightly higher than our short-term asset growth.\nImpact of Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nNet interest income includes interest accrued on interest-rate-exchange agreements that are associated with advances, investments, deposits, and debt instruments that qualify for hedge accounting. We generally use derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as interest rate risk-management tools. These derivatives serve to stabilize net interest income and net interest margin when interest rates fluctuate. Accordingly, the impact of derivatives on net interest income and net interest margin should be viewed in the overall context of our risk-management strategy. The following tables show the net effect of derivatives and hedging activities on net interest income, net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, and net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (dollars in thousands).\n\n_____________________\n (1) Represents the amortization/accretion of hedging fair-value adjustments and cash-flow hedge amortization reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss. \n (2) Represents interest income/expense on derivatives included in net interest income. \n\n_____________________\n (1) Represents the amortization/accretion of hedging fair-value adjustments. \n (2) Represents interest income/expense on derivatives included in net interest income. \n\n_____________________\n (1) Represents the amortization/accretion of hedging fair-value adjustments. \n (2) Represents interest income/expense on derivatives included in net interest income. \nNet interest margin was 0.41 percent for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. If derivatives had not been used as hedges to mitigate the impact of interest-rate fluctuations, net interest margin would have been 0.60 percent and 0.63 percent, respectively.\nInterest paid and received on interest-rate-exchange agreements that are economic hedges is classified as net losses on derivatives and hedging activities in other income. As shown under - Other Income (Loss) below, interest accruals on derivatives classified as economic hedges totaled a net expense of $6.9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOther Income (Loss)\nThe following table presents a summary of other income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. Additionally, detail on the components of net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities is provided, indicating the source of these gains and losses by type of hedging relationship and hedge accounting treatment.\n\nLitigation settlement income has had a dominant impact on Other Income (Loss) during the periods represented above, and is expected to decline in future years after the remainder of our claims are either settled or resolved through litigation. Apart from litigation settlement income, as evident in the Other Income (Loss) table above, accounting for derivatives and hedged items results in the potential for considerable timing differences between income recognition from assets or liabilities and income effects of hedging instruments entered into to mitigate interest-rate risk and cash-flow activity.\nChanges in the fair value of trading securities are recorded in other income (loss). For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded net unrealized losses on trading securities of $4.9 million and unrealized gains of $972,000, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the associated economic hedges amounted to net gains of $2.7 million and $836,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition to the changes in fair value are interest accruals on these economic hedges, which resulted in net expenses of $7.0 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in other income (loss).\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, compensation and benefits expense and other operating expenses totaled $67.0 million, representing an increase of $9.5 million from the total of $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by a $9.4 million increase in compensation and benefits expense which was the result of a voluntary contribution to the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan and increases to our incentive compensation awards.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014, versus the year ended December 31, 2013\nNet income decreased to $149.8 million at December 31, 2014, from $212.3 million at December 31, 2013. A significant component of the decline was the difference in litigation settlements year-over-year. Our return on average equity was 5.24 percent at December 31, 2014, compared with 7.40 percent at December 31, 2013, a decline of 216 basis points, of which 110 basis points is attributable to the decline in litigation settlements. Compression in net interest margin led to the year-over-year decline in our net interest income, the other significant component of the decline in net income, although the decline in net interest income reflected a return to net interest spreads and margins that were closer to long-term historical norms.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreased $42.6 million from $255.9 million in 2013 to $213.3 million in 2014. Contributing to the decrease in net interest income was a decrease in net prepayment fees of $19.2 million, as well as a narrowing of the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Partially offsetting these decreases to net interest income was an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in average earning assets of $12.4 billion from $39.3 billion for 2013, to $51.7 billion for 2014. The increase in average earning assets was driven by an increase of $8.4 billion in average advances and an increase of $4.1 billion in average investment balances. Additionally, $36.0 million of our interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014, was from the accretion of discount on securities that were other-than-temporarily impaired in prior periods, but for which a significant improvement in projected cash flows has subsequently been recognized. This represents an increase of $16.3 million from $19.7 million of accretion recorded in 2013.\nIn 2014, we experienced compression in net interest margin. Net interest margin fell to 0.41 percent for the year ended December 31, 2014, from 0.65 percent for the year ended December 31, 2013. The compression resulted from the run-off of higher-yielding long-term advances, investments and mortgage loans, a reduction in prepayment fee income, and the increase in our dividends paid on mandatorily-redeemable capital stock, which are classified as interest expense.\nThe average balance of fixed-rate advances that were hedged with interest-rate swaps to yield an effective floating rate totaled $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. Therefore, a significant portion of our advances, including overnight advances, short-term fixed-rate advances, fixed-rate putable advances, certain fixed-rate bullet advances, and variable-rate advances, either earn a short-term interest rate or are swapped to a short-term index, resulting in yields that closely follow short-term market interest-rate trends. The average balance of all such advances totaled $20.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing 66.9 percent of the total average balance of advances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of all such advances totaled $12.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing 56.7 percent of the total average balance of advances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, net prepayment fees on advances and investments were $10.5 million and $29.7 million, respectively.\nAverage short-term money-market investments, consisting of interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold, increased $5.1 billion, or 111.1 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with the same period in 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, average balances of securities purchased under agreements to resell increased $2.2 billion and average balances of federal funds sold increased $2.8 billion in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nAverage investment-securities balances decreased $982.1 million, or 10.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with the same period in 2013, a decrease consisting primarily of a $1.3 billion decline in agency and supranational institutions' debentures offset by a $320.9 million increase in MBS.\nAverage CO balances increased $12.9 billion, or 37.8 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with the same period in 2013, resulting from our increased funding needs principally due to the increase in our average advances balances and short-term money-market investment balances. This overall increase consisted of an increase of $13.6 billion in CO discount notes and a decrease of $652.9 million in CO bonds.\nThe average balance of CO discount notes represented approximately 48.1 percent of total average COs during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared with 26.6 percent of total average COs during the year ended December 31, 2013. The average balance of CO bonds represented 51.9 percent and 73.4 percent of total average COs outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nImpact of Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nNet interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, was 0.41 percent and 0.65 percent, respectively. If derivatives had not been used as hedges to mitigate the impact of interest-rate fluctuations, net interest margin would have been 0.63 percent and 0.96 percent, respectively.\nOther Income (Loss) and Operating Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded net unrealized gains on trading securities of $972,000 and unrealized losses of $13.2 million, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the associated economic hedges amounted to net gains of $836,000 and $13.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition to the changes\nin fair value are interest accruals on these economic hedges, which resulted in a net expense of $7.1 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, compensation and benefits expense and other operating expenses totaled $57.5 million, representing an increase of $1.3 million from the total of $56.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nAdvances\nAt December 31, 2015, the advances portfolio totaled $36.1 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion compared with $33.5 billion at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table summarizes advances outstanding by product type at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\n_____________________\n (1) Includes floating-rate advances that may be contractually prepaid by the borrower on a floating-rate reset date without incurring prepayment or termination fees. \nSee Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 8 - Advances for disclosures relating to redemption terms of the advances portfolio.\nAdvances Credit Risk\nWe endeavor to minimize credit risk on advances by monitoring the financial condition of our borrowers and by holding sufficient collateral to protect the Bank from credit losses. All pledged collateral is subject to haircuts assigned based on our opinion of the risk that such collateral presents. We are prohibited by Section 10(a) of the FHLBank Act from making advances without sufficient collateral to secure the advance. We have never experienced a credit loss on an advance.\nWe monitor the financial condition of all members and housing associates by reviewing available financial data, such as regulatory call reports filed by depository institution members, regulatory financial statements filed with the appropriate state insurance department by insurance company members, audited financial statements of housing associates, SEC filings, and rating-agency reports to ensure that potentially troubled members are identified as soon as possible. In addition, we have access to most members' regulatory examination reports. We analyze this information on a regular basis.\nOur members continue to be challenged by economic conditions, although improvements continue. Aggregate nonperforming assets for depository institution members declined from 0.50 percent of assets as of December 31, 2014, to 0.46 percent of assets as of September 30, 2015. The aggregate ratio of tangible capital to assets among the membership increased from 9.44 percent of assets as of December 31, 2014, to 9.75 percent as of September 30, 2015. (September 30, 2015, is the date of our most recent data on our membership for this report.). There were no member failures during 2015. All of our extensions of credit to members are secured by eligible collateral as noted herein. However we could incur losses if a member were to default, if the value of the collateral pledged by the member declined to a point such that we were unable to realize sufficient value from the pledged collateral to cover the member's obligations, and we were unable to obtain additional collateral to make up for the reduction in value of such collateral. Although not expected, a default by a member with significant obligations to us could result in significant financial losses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe assign each non-insurance company borrower to one of the following three credit status categories based primarily on our assessment of the borrower's overall financial condition and other factors:\n \u2022 Category-1: members that are generally in satisfactory financial condition; \n \u2022 Category-2: members that show weakening financial trends in key financial indices and/or regulatory findings; and \n \u2022 Category-3: members with financial weaknesses that present an elevated level of concern. We also place housing associates and non-member borrowers in Category-3. \nWe monitor the financial condition of our insurance company members quarterly. We lend to them based on our assessment of their financial condition and their pledge of sufficient amounts of eligible collateral.\nEach credit status category reflects our increasing level of control over the collateral pledged by the borrower as its financial condition weakens. Category-1 borrowers retain possession of all mortgage loan collateral pledged to us, provided the borrower executes a written security agreement and agrees to hold such collateral for our benefit. Category-1 borrowers must specifically list with us all mortgage loan collateral other than loans secured by first-mortgage loans on owner-occupied one- to four-family residential property. Category-2 borrowers retain possession of eligible mortgage loan collateral, however, we require such borrowers to specifically list all mortgage loan collateral pledged to us. Category-3 borrowers are required to place physical possession of all pledged eligible collateral with us or an approved safekeeping agent, with which we have a control agreement. All securities pledged to us by our borrowers must be delivered to us, an approved safekeeping agent, or be held by the borrower's securities corporation in a custodial account with us. We have control agreements with approved safekeeping agents which are intended to give us appropriate control over the related collateral.\nOur agreements with our borrowers require each borrower to have sufficient eligible collateral pledged to us to fully secure all outstanding extensions of credit, including advances, accrued interest receivable, standby letters of credit, MPF credit-enhancement obligations, and lines of credit (collectively, extensions of credit) at all times. We generally accept the following types of assets as collateral:\n \u2022 fully disbursed, first-mortgage loans on improved residential property (provided that the borrower is not in arrears by two or more payments), or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages; \n \u2022 securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any agency thereof (including without limitation, MBS issued or guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae); \n \u2022 cash or deposits in a collateral account with us; and \n \u2022 other real-estate-related collateral acceptable to us if such collateral has a readily ascertainable value and we can perfect our security interest in the collateral. \nIn addition, in the case of any community financial institution, as defined in accordance with the FHLBank Act, we may accept as collateral secured loans for small business and agriculture, or securities representing a whole interest in such secured loans.\nTo mitigate the credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk associated with collateral, we discount the book value or market value of pledged collateral to establish the lending value of the collateral to us. Collateral that we have determined to contain a low level of risk, such as U.S. government obligations, is discounted at a lower rate than collateral that carries a higher level of risk, such as commercial real estate mortgage loans. We periodically analyze the discounts applied to all eligible collateral types to verify that current discounts are sufficient to fully secure us against losses in the event of a borrower default. Our agreements with our members and borrowers grant us authority, in our sole discretion, to adjust the discounts applied to\ncollateral at any time based on our assessment of the member's financial condition, the quality of collateral pledged, or the overall volatility of the value of the collateral.\nWe generally require our members and housing associates to execute a security agreement that grants us a blanket lien on all assets of such borrower that consist of, among other types of collateral: fully disbursed whole first-mortgage loans and deeds of trust constituting first liens against real property; U.S. federal, state, and municipal obligations; GSE securities; corporate debt obligations; commercial paper; funds placed in deposit accounts with us; COs, such other items or property that are offered to us by the borrower as collateral; and all proceeds of all of the foregoing. In the case of insurance companies and housing associates, in some instances we establish a specific lien instead of a blanket lien subject to our receipt of additional safeguards from such members including larger haircuts on collateral. We protect our security interest in pledged assets by filing a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) financing statement in the appropriate jurisdiction. Our employees conduct on-site reviews of collateral pledged by borrowers to confirm the existence of the pledged collateral and to determine that the pledged collateral conforms to our eligibility requirements. We may conduct an onsite collateral review at any time.\nOur agreements with borrowers allow us, in our sole discretion, to refuse to make extensions of credit against any collateral, require substitution of collateral, or adjust the discounts applied to collateral at any time. We also may require members to pledge additional collateral regardless of whether the collateral would be eligible to originate a new extension of credit. Our agreements with our borrowers also afford us the right, in our sole discretion, to declare any borrower to be in default if we deem ourselves to be insecure.\nBeyond our practice of taking security interests in collateral, Section 10(e) of the FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted by a federally insured depository institution member or such a member's affiliate to us priority over the claims or rights of any other party, including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar entity that has the rights of a lien creditor, unless these claims and rights would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and are held by actual purchasers or by parties that are secured by actual perfected security interests. In this regard, the priority granted to our security interests under Section 10(e) may not apply when lending to insurance company members due to the anti-preemption provision contained in the McCarran-Ferguson Act in which Congress declared that federal law would not preempt state insurance law unless the federal law expressly regulates the business of insurance. Thus, if state law conflicts with Section 10(e) of the FHLBank Act, the protection afforded by this provision may not be available to us. However, we protect our security interests in the collateral pledged by our borrowers, including insurance company members, by filing UCC financing statements, or by taking possession or control of such collateral, or by taking other appropriate steps. We have not experienced any rehabilitation, conservatorship, receivership, liquidation or other insolvency event for an insurance company member and therefore have continuing uncertainty on the potential inapplicability of Section 10(e). Additionally, we note that the relevant state insolvency authority could take actions that could impede our ability to sell collateral that any such insolvent member has pledged to us.\nThe following table shows the asset quality of the one- to four-family mortgage loan portfolios held on the balance sheets of our borrowers. One- to four-family mortgage loans constitute the largest asset type pledged as collateral to us. Note that these figures include all one- to four-family mortgage loans on depository borrowers' balance sheets. The figures in this table include loans that are not pledged as collateral to us. Qualified collateral does not include loans that have been in default within the most recent 12-month period, except that whole first-mortgage collateral on one- to four-family residential property is acceptable provided no payment is overdue by more than 45 days, unless the collateral is insured or guaranteed by the U.S. or any agency thereof.\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Our net income increased to $289.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, the highest annual net income in the Bank's history, largely due to $184.9 million in litigation settlement income related to private-label MBS for the year. In addition, advances balances grew as discussed below. Our financial condition continued to strengthen with retained earnings growing to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015, from $901.7 million at December 31, 2014, a surplus of $428.8 million over our minimum retained earnings target, as we continue to satisfy all regulatory capital requirements as of December 31, 2015. We also provided a dividend spread of 300 basis points over the daily average three-month LIBOR. Our return on average equity was 9.54 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 5.24 percent for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 430 basis points.\nNet Interest Margin\nIn 2015, net interest margin was flat relative to the year ended December 31, 2014, at 0.41 percent. We view this as a favorable outcome in the face of the continuing very low interest-rate environment discussed under - Economic Conditions - Interest-Rate Environment.\nAdvances Balances\nWe continue to deliver on our primary mission, supplying liquidity to our members, with advances balances growing to $36.1 billion at December 31, 2015, from $33.5 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase in advances was broadly based, with long-term advances as the most significant contributor. We cannot predict whether this trend will continue.\nInvestments in Private-Label MBS\nThe amortized cost of our total investments in private-label MBS and ABS backed by home-equity loans has declined to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $6.4 billion at its peak in September 30, 2007, and other-than-temporary impairment credit losses recognized in recent periods have dropped significantly from those earlier periods.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $38.8 million and $36.0 million, respectively, in interest income resulting from the increased accretable yields of certain private-label MBS for which we had previously recognized credit losses. For a discussion of this accounting treatment, see Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Investment Securities - Other-than-Temporary Impairment - Interest Income Recognition.\nExcess Stock Management Program\nOn July 24, 2015, our board of directors authorized management to implement an excess stock management program, under which we may repurchase excess stock to maintain aggregate excess stock within a targeted range between zero and $200 million. Repurchases of excess stock have led to reductions in our capital levels, including reductions to mandatorily redeemable capital stock from $298.6 million at December 31, 2014, to $42.0 million at December 31, 2015. Dividend payments on mandatorily redeemable capital stock are classified as interest expense, so the repurchase of this stock should lead to a reduction in interest expense, all other things being equal. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock amounted to $1.6 million compared with $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRegulatory Developments\nThe FHFA and other regulators with authority over us or our way of doing business have issued or proposed multiple regulations during the year and into 2016, as described in - Legislative and Regulatory Developments. Such developments affect the way we conduct business and could impact the way we satisfy our mission as well as the value of our membership.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nEconomic Environment\nThe U.S. economy in 2015 proved resilient. Against the backdrop of a historically severe winter and economic instability overseas, the U.S. economy continued to expand.\nThe labor market continued to improve, with nonfarm payroll growth averaging over 200,000 per month for the year. At five percent in December, the unemployment rate declined 0.6 percentage point since December 2014. Alternative broader gauges of unemployment also showed steady improvement. All six of the New England states continued to see unemployment rates decline between December 2014 and 2015. Over this period, the region's unemployment rate dropped 0.7 percentage points and in December 2015 was 4.7 percent.\nThe gradual recovery in the housing market continued in 2015. The FHFA reported that house prices were up 5.8 percent in December 2015 compared to a year prior. Annual house price changes were positive for all nine census regions, reflecting a broad housing market recovery across the U.S. The housing market provided a significant boost to the New England economy in 2015, with rising prices and construction activity.\nThe U.S. and New England economies appear likely to continue to grow at a modest pace. Even though equity prices have been volatile and overseas risks appear to have heightened in early 2016, continued job gains, lower energy prices, and rising house prices look likely to support consumer spending and economic growth in 2016.\nInterest-Rate Environment\nSince 2010 and continuing into 2016, we generally have been operating in a historically low interest-rate environment, which has adversely impacted our results of operations.\nWe note that on March 16, 2016, despite having increased the targeted federal funds rate for the first time since 2006 at its December 2015 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) issued a press release providing that in light of ongoing global risks and continued low price inflation, a more accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. The statement noted that the FOMC expects economic conditions that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\nThe interest-rate environment adversely impacts our results of operations. Interest rates continue to hover close to record low levels, compressing the yields and margins that we can earn on our liquidity investments and short-term advances because our funding costs essentially have a floor of zero percent. Moreover, spreads on high-quality, interest-bearing assets in which we invest remain low relative to the yields at which we can issue comparable term debt.\nThe following chart illustrates the interest-rate environment.\nThe federal funds target rate has remained constant at zero to 0.25 percent during the time periods from the fourth quarter 2014 through the third quarter 2015. On December 17, 2015, the FOMC had raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 0.25 to 0.50 percent.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015, versus the year ended December 31, 2014\nNet income increased to $289.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The reasons for the increase are discussed under - Executive Summary.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses for the year ending December 31, 2015, was $226.0 million, compared with $213.2 million for 2014. The $12.8 million increase in net interest income after provision for credit losses was attributable to a $3.5 billion increase in average earning assets, from $51.7 billion for 2014, to $55.2 billion for 2015. The increase in average earning assets was driven by a $2.3 billion increase in average advances balances and a $1.0 billion increase in average investments balances. For additional information see - Rate and Volume Analysis. Additional increases to net interest income included a $7.2 million reduction of interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock and a $2.8 million increase in accretion of discount on securities that were other-than-temporarily impaired in prior periods, but for which a significant improvement in projected cash flows has subsequently been recognized. Offsetting these increases was a $2.2 million decrease in net prepayment fees from investments and advances from $10.5 million in the year ending December 31, 2014, to $8.3 million in the year ending December 31, 2015.\nNet interest spread was 0.37 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015, a one basis point increase from 2014, and net interest margin was 0.41 percent, unchanged from 2014. The increase in net interest spread reflects a two basis point decrease in the average yield on earning assets and a three basis point decrease in the average yield on interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe following table presents major categories of average balances, related interest income/expense, and average yields for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our primary source of earnings is net interest income, which is the interest earned on advances, mortgage loans, and investments less interest paid on COs, deposits, and other sources of funds.\nTable

are reflected at amortized cost; therefore the resulting yields do not give effect to changes in fair value or the noncredit component of a previously recognized other-than-temporary impairment reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. \nRate and Volume Analysis\nChanges in both average balances (volume) and interest rates influence changes in net interest income and net interest margin. The following table summarizes changes in interest income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Changes in interest income and interest expense that are not identifiable as either volume-related or rate-related, but are equally attributable to both volume and rate changes, have been allocated to the volume and rate categories based upon the proportion of the absolute value of the volume and rate changes.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td>Rate and Volume Analysis\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td>

2015, compared with the same period in 2014. We experienced a broadly based rise in advances balances during the year with long-term advances as the most significant contributor. We cannot predict whether this trend will continue.

Therefore, a significant portion of our advances, including overnight advances, short-term fixed-rate advances, fixed-rate putable advances, certain fixed-rate bullet advances, and variable-rate advances, either earn a short-term interest rate or are swapped to a short-term index, resulting in yields that closely follow short-term market interest-rate trends. The average balance of all such advances totaled $22.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing 69.0 percent of the total average balance of advances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2015. The average balance of all such advances totaled $20.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing 66.9 percent of the total average balance of advances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, net prepayment fees on advances and investments were $8.3 million and $10.5 million, respectively. Prepayment-fee income is unpredictable and inconsistent from period to period, occurring only when advances and investments are prepaid prior to the scheduled maturity or repricing dates, and generally when prevailing reinvestment yields are lower than those of the prepaid advances.\nAverage Balance of Investments\nAverage short-term money-market investments, consisting of interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold, increased $591.4 million, or 6.2 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period in 2014. The yield earned on short-term money-market investments is highly correlated to short-term market interest rates. These investments are used for liquidity management and to manage our leverage ratio in response to fluctuations in other asset balances. We have increased these investments principally in response to growth in our advances balances to maintain the level of our contingency liquidity. For the year ended December 31, 2015, average balances of federal funds sold increased $790.4 million and average balances of securities purchased under agreements to resell decreased $224.0 million in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAverage investment-securities balances increased $450.9 million, or 5.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period in 2014, an increase consisting primarily of a $581.3 million increase in MBS offset by a $124.9 million decline in agency and supranational institutions' debentures.\nAverage Balance of COs\nAverage CO balances increased $4.1 billion, or 8.7 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the same period in 2014, resulting from our increased funding needs principally due to the increase in our average advances balances and short-term money-market investment balances. This overall increase consisted of an increase of $2.5 billion in CO discount notes and an increase of $1.6 billion in CO bonds.\nThe average balance of CO discount notes represented approximately 49.2 percent of total average COs during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 48.1 percent of total average COs during the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of CO bonds represented 50.8 percent and 51.9 percent of total average COs outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The proportional growth in average CO discount notes was slightly higher than our short-term asset growth.\nImpact of Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nNet interest income includes interest accrued on interest-rate-exchange agreements that are associated with advances, investments, deposits, and debt instruments that qualify for hedge accounting. We generally use derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as interest rate risk-management tools. These derivatives serve to stabilize net interest income and net interest margin when interest rates fluctuate. Accordingly, the impact of derivatives on net interest income and net interest margin should be viewed in the overall context of our risk-management strategy. The following tables show the net effect of derivatives and hedging activities on net interest income, net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, and net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

If derivatives had not been used as hedges to mitigate the impact of interest-rate fluctuations, net interest margin would have been 0.60 percent and 0.63 percent, respectively.\nInterest paid and received on interest-rate-exchange agreements that are economic hedges is classified as net losses on derivatives and hedging activities in other income. As shown under - Other Income (Loss) below, interest accruals on derivatives classified as economic hedges totaled a net expense of $6.9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOther Income (Loss)\nThe following table presents a summary of other income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.

Apart from litigation settlement income, as evident in the Other Income (Loss) table above, accounting for derivatives and hedged items results in the potential for considerable timing differences between income recognition from assets or liabilities and income effects of hedging instruments entered into to mitigate interest-rate risk and cash-flow activity.\nChanges in the fair value of trading securities are recorded in other income (loss). For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded net unrealized losses on trading securities of $4.9 million and unrealized gains of $972,000, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the associated economic hedges amounted to net gains of $2.7 million and $836,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition to the changes in fair value are interest accruals on these economic hedges, which resulted in net expenses of $7.0 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in other income (loss).\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, compensation and benefits expense and other operating expenses totaled $67.0 million, representing an increase of $9.5 million from the total of $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by a $9.4 million increase in compensation and benefits expense which was the result of a voluntary contribution to the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan and increases to our incentive compensation awards.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014, versus the year ended December 31, 2013\nNet income decreased to $149.8 million at December 31, 2014, from $212.3 million at December 31, 2013. A significant component of the decline was the difference in litigation settlements year-over-year. Our return on average equity was 5.24 percent at December 31, 2014, compared with 7.40 percent at December 31, 2013, a decline of 216 basis points, of which 110 basis points is attributable to the decline in litigation settlements. Compression in net interest margin led to the year-over-year decline in our net interest income, the other significant component of the decline in net income, although the decline in net interest income reflected a return to net interest spreads and margins that were closer to long-term historical norms.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014, decreased $42.6 million from $255.9 million in 2013 to $213.3 million in 2014. Contributing to the decrease in net interest income was a decrease in net prepayment fees of $19.2 million, as well as a narrowing of the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Partially offsetting these decreases to net interest income was an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in average earning assets of $12.4 billion from $39.3 billion for 2013, to $51.7 billion for 2014. The increase in average earning assets was driven by an increase of $8.4 billion in average advances and an increase of $4.1 billion in average investment balances. Additionally, $36.0 million of our interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014, was from the accretion of discount on securities that were other-than-temporarily impaired in prior periods, but for which a significant improvement in projected cash flows has subsequently been recognized. This represents an increase of $16.3 million from $19.7 million of accretion recorded in 2013.\nIn 2014, we experienced compression in net interest margin. Net interest margin fell to 0.41 percent for the year ended December 31, 2014, from 0.65 percent for the year ended December 31, 2013. The compression resulted from the run-off of higher-yielding long-term advances, investments and mortgage loans, a reduction in prepayment fee income, and the increase in our dividends paid on mandatorily-redeemable capital stock, which are classified as interest expense.\nThe average balance of fixed-rate advances that were hedged with interest-rate swaps to yield an effective floating rate totaled $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. Therefore, a significant portion of our advances, including overnight advances, short-term fixed-rate advances, fixed-rate putable advances, certain fixed-rate bullet advances, and variable-rate advances, either earn a short-term interest rate or are swapped to a short-term index, resulting in yields that closely follow short-term market interest-rate trends. The average balance of all such advances totaled $20.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing 66.9 percent of the total average balance of advances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of all such advances totaled $12.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing 56.7 percent of the total average balance of advances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, net prepayment fees on advances and investments were $10.5 million and $29.7 million, respectively.\nAverage short-term money-market investments, consisting of interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold, increased $5.1 billion, or 111.1 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with the same period in 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, average balances of securities purchased under agreements to resell increased $2.2 billion and average balances of federal funds sold increased $2.8 billion in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nAverage investment-securities balances decreased $982.1 million, or 10.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with the same period in 2013, a decrease consisting primarily of a $1.3 billion decline in agency and supranational institutions' debentures offset by a $320.9 million increase in MBS.\nAverage CO balances increased $12.9 billion, or 37.8 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with the same period in 2013, resulting from our increased funding needs principally due to the increase in our average advances balances and short-term money-market investment balances. This overall increase consisted of an increase of $13.6 billion in CO discount notes and a decrease of $652.9 million in CO bonds.\nThe average balance of CO discount notes represented approximately 48.1 percent of total average COs during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared with 26.6 percent of total average COs during the year ended December 31, 2013. The average balance of CO bonds represented 51.9 percent and 73.4 percent of total average COs outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nImpact of Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nNet interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, was 0.41 percent and 0.65 percent, respectively. If derivatives had not been used as hedges to mitigate the impact of interest-rate fluctuations, net interest margin would have been 0.63 percent and 0.96 percent, respectively.\nOther Income (Loss) and Operating Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded net unrealized gains on trading securities of $972,000 and unrealized losses of $13.2 million, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the associated economic hedges amounted to net gains of $836,000 and $13.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition to the changes\nin fair value are interest accruals on these economic hedges, which resulted in a net expense of $7.1 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, compensation and benefits expense and other operating expenses totaled $57.5 million, representing an increase of $1.3 million from the total of $56.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nAdvances\nAt December 31, 2015, the advances portfolio totaled $36.1 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion compared with $33.5 billion at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table summarizes advances outstanding by product type at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td>Advances Outstanding by Product Type\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Par Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Par Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-rate advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,392,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,029,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term\n</td> <td>11,777,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,526,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Putable\n</td> <td>2,022,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,180,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overnight\n</td> <td>1,080,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,545,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortizing\n</td> <td>887,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>883,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other fixed-rate advances\n</td> <td>97,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>29,257,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,236,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable-rate advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simple variable (1)\n</td> <td>6,504,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,915,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Putable\n</td> <td>157,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other variable-rate indexed advances\n</td> <td>48,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>6,710,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,038,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,967,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,274,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________\n (1) Includes floating-rate advances that may be contractually prepaid by the borrower on a floating-rate reset date without incurring prepayment or termination fees. \nSee Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 8 - Advances for disclosures relating to redemption terms of the advances portfolio.\nAdvances Credit Risk\nWe endeavor to minimize credit risk on advances by monitoring the financial condition of our borrowers and by holding sufficient collateral to protect the Bank from credit losses. All pledged collateral is subject to haircuts assigned based on our opinion of the risk that such collateral presents. We are prohibited by Section 10(a) of the FHLBank Act from making advances without sufficient collateral to secure the advance. We have never experienced a credit loss on an advance.\nWe monitor the financial condition of all members and housing associates by reviewing available financial data, such as regulatory call reports filed by depository institution members, regulatory financial statements filed with the appropriate state insurance department by insurance company members, audited financial statements of housing associates, SEC filings, and rating-agency reports to ensure that potentially troubled members are identified as soon as possible. In addition, we have access to most members' regulatory examination reports. We analyze this information on a regular basis.\nOur members continue to be challenged by economic conditions, although improvements continue. Aggregate nonperforming assets for depository institution members declined from 0.50 percent of assets as of December 31, 2014, to 0.46 percent of assets as of September 30, 2015. The aggregate ratio of tangible capital to assets among the membership increased from 9.44 percent of assets as of December 31, 2014, to 9.75 percent as of September 30, 2015. (September 30, 2015, is the date of our most recent data on our membership for this report.). There were no member failures during 2015. All of our extensions of credit to members are secured by eligible collateral as noted herein. However we could incur losses if a member were to default, if the value of the collateral pledged by the member declined to a point such that we were unable to realize sufficient value from the pledged collateral to cover the member's obligations, and we were unable to obtain additional collateral to make up for the reduction in value of such collateral. Although not expected, a default by a member with significant obligations to us could result in significant financial losses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe assign each non-insurance company borrower to one of the following three credit status categories based primarily on our assessment of the borrower's overall financial condition and other factors:\n \u2022 Category-1: members that are generally in satisfactory financial condition; \n \u2022 Category-2: members that show weakening financial trends in key financial indices and/or regulatory findings; and \n \u2022 Category-3: members with financial weaknesses that present an elevated level of concern. We also place housing associates and non-member borrowers in Category-3. \nWe monitor the financial condition of our insurance company members quarterly. We lend to them based on our assessment of their financial condition and their pledge of sufficient amounts of eligible collateral.\nEach credit status category reflects our increasing level of control over the collateral pledged by the borrower as its financial condition weakens. Category-1 borrowers retain possession of all mortgage loan collateral pledged to us, provided the borrower executes a written security agreement and agrees to hold such collateral for our benefit. Category-1 borrowers must specifically list with us all mortgage loan collateral other than loans secured by first-mortgage loans on owner-occupied one- to four-family residential property. Category-2 borrowers retain possession of eligible mortgage loan collateral, however, we require such borrowers to specifically list all mortgage loan collateral pledged to us. Category-3 borrowers are required to place physical possession of all pledged eligible collateral with us or an approved safekeeping agent, with which we have a control agreement. All securities pledged to us by our borrowers must be delivered to us, an approved safekeeping agent, or be held by the borrower's securities corporation in a custodial account with us. We have control agreements with approved safekeeping agents which are intended to give us appropriate control over the related collateral.\nOur agreements with our borrowers require each borrower to have sufficient eligible collateral pledged to us to fully secure all outstanding extensions of credit, including advances, accrued interest receivable, standby letters of credit, MPF credit-enhancement obligations, and lines of credit (collectively, extensions of credit) at all times. We generally accept the following types of assets as collateral:\n \u2022 fully disbursed, first-mortgage loans on improved residential property (provided that the borrower is not in arrears by two or more payments), or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages; \n \u2022 securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any agency thereof (including without limitation, MBS issued or guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae); \n \u2022 cash or deposits in a collateral account with us; and \n \u2022 other real-estate-related collateral acceptable to us if such collateral has a readily ascertainable value and we can perfect our security interest in the collateral. \nIn addition, in the case of any community financial institution, as defined in accordance with the FHLBank Act, we may accept as collateral secured loans for small business and agriculture, or securities representing a whole interest in such secured loans.\nTo mitigate the credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk associated with collateral, we discount the book value or market value of pledged collateral to establish the lending value of the collateral to us. Collateral that we have determined to contain a low level of risk, such as U.S. government obligations, is discounted at a lower rate than collateral that carries a higher level of risk, such as commercial real estate mortgage loans. We periodically analyze the discounts applied to all eligible collateral types to verify that current discounts are sufficient to fully secure us against losses in the event of a borrower default. Our agreements with our members and borrowers grant us authority, in our sole discretion, to adjust the discounts applied to\ncollateral at any time based on our assessment of the member's financial condition, the quality of collateral pledged, or the overall volatility of the value of the collateral.\nWe generally require our members and housing associates to execute a security agreement that grants us a blanket lien on all assets of such borrower that consist of, among other types of collateral: fully disbursed whole first-mortgage loans and deeds of trust constituting first liens against real property; U.S. federal, state, and municipal obligations; GSE securities; corporate debt obligations; commercial paper; funds placed in deposit accounts with us; COs, such other items or property that are offered to us by the borrower as collateral; and all proceeds of all of the foregoing. In the case of insurance companies and housing associates, in some instances we establish a specific lien instead of a blanket lien subject to our receipt of additional safeguards from such members including larger haircuts on collateral. We protect our security interest in pledged assets by filing a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) financing statement in the appropriate jurisdiction. Our employees conduct on-site reviews of collateral pledged by borrowers to confirm the existence of the pledged collateral and to determine that the pledged collateral conforms to our eligibility requirements. We may conduct an onsite collateral review at any time.\nOur agreements with borrowers allow us, in our sole discretion, to refuse to make extensions of credit against any collateral, require substitution of collateral, or adjust the discounts applied to collateral at any time. We also may require members to pledge additional collateral regardless of whether the collateral would be eligible to originate a new extension of credit. Our agreements with our borrowers also afford us the right, in our sole discretion, to declare any borrower to be in default if we deem ourselves to be insecure.\nBeyond our practice of taking security interests in collateral, Section 10(e) of the FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted by a federally insured depository institution member or such a member's affiliate to us priority over the claims or rights of any other party, including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar entity that has the rights of a lien creditor, unless these claims and rights would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and are held by actual purchasers or by parties that are secured by actual perfected security interests. In this regard, the priority granted to our security interests under Section 10(e) may not apply when lending to insurance company members due to the anti-preemption provision contained in the McCarran-Ferguson Act in which Congress declared that federal law would not preempt state insurance law unless the federal law expressly regulates the business of insurance. Thus, if state law conflicts with Section 10(e) of the FHLBank Act, the protection afforded by this provision may not be available to us. However, we protect our security interests in the collateral pledged by our borrowers, including insurance company members, by filing UCC financing statements, or by taking possession or control of such collateral, or by taking other appropriate steps. We have not experienced any rehabilitation, conservatorship, receivership, liquidation or other insolvency event for an insurance company member and therefore have continuing uncertainty on the potential inapplicability of Section 10(e). Additionally, we note that the relevant state insolvency authority could take actions that could impede our ability to sell collateral that any such insolvent member has pledged to us.\nThe following table shows the asset quality of the one- to four-family mortgage loan portfolios held on the balance sheets of our borrowers. One- to four-family mortgage loans constitute the largest asset type pledged as collateral to us. Note that these figures include all one- to four-family mortgage loans on depository borrowers' balance sheets. The figures in this table include loans that are not pledged as collateral to us. Qualified collateral does not include loans that have been in default within the most recent 12-month period, except that whole first-mortgage collateral on one- to four-family residential property is acceptable provided no payment is overdue by more than 45 days, unless the collateral is insured or guaranteed by the U.S. or any agency thereof.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> 2015 Quarterly Borrower Asset Quality\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015-Quarter Ended (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrower assets(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,288,130,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,306,038,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,254,192,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total 1-4 family first lien mortgage loans(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,209,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,500,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,108,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-4 family first lien mortgage loans delinquent 30-89 days as a percentage of 1-4 family mortgage loans (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-4 family first lien mortgage loans delinquent 90+ days as a percentage of 1-4 family mortgage loans(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.28\n</td> <td>%\n</td>"}
