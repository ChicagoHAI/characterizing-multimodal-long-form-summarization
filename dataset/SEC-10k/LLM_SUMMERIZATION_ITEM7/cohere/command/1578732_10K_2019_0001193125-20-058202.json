Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Factors Affecting Our Business\n\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur Business\nWe are a leading national brokerage firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services. We have been the top commercial real estate investment broker in the United States based on the number of investment transactions over the last 10 years. As of December 31, 2019, we had 2,021 investment sales and financing professionals that are primarily exclusive independent contractors operating in 82 offices who provide real estate brokerage and financing services to sellers and buyers of commercial real estate. We also offer market research, consulting and advisory services to our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we closed 9,726 investment sales, financing and other transactions with total sales volume of approximately $49.7 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed 9,472 sales, financing and other transactions with total sales volume of approximately $46.4 billion.\nWe generate revenues by collecting real estate brokerage commissions upon the sale, and fees upon the financing of, commercial properties and by providing consulting and advisory services. Real estate brokerage commissions are typically based upon the value of the property, and financing fees are typically based upon the size of the loan. During the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 91% of our revenues were generated from real estate brokerage commissions, 8% from financing fees and 1% from other revenues, including consulting and advisory services.\nDuring 2019, we acquired one business that was accounted for as a business combination and the results have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. This acquisition expanded our network of real estate sales professionals and provided further diversification to our real estate brokerage services.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOur business and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity are significantly affected by the number and size of commercial real estate investment sales and financing transactions that we close in any period. The number and size of these transactions are affected by our ability to recruit and retain investment sales and financing professionals, identify and contract properties for sale and identify those that need financing and refinancing. We principally monitor the commercial real estate market through four factors, which generally drive our business. The factors are the economy, commercial real estate supply and demand, capital markets and investor sentiment and investment activity.\nThe Economy\nOur business is dependent on economic conditions within the markets in which we operate. Changes in the economy on a global, national, regional or local basis can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Economic indicators and projections related to job growth, unemployment, interest rates, retail spending and confidence trends can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Overall market conditions, including global trade, interest rate changes and job creation, can affect investor sentiment and, ultimately, the demand for our services from investors in real estate.\nThe U.S. economy maintained moderate, but steady growth in the fourth quarter of 2019. It appears the low inflation, low unemployment climate has granted the Federal Reserve policy latitude, allowing them to maintain low interest rates. Steady job creation, averaging 176,000 (based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics) positions per month last year, and moderate wage growth may sustain above-average household formation and consumption levels, contributing to economic growth this year. This momentum may be partially offset by uncertainty surrounding the upcoming elections, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and concerns about the potential contagion risks of the Coronavirus.\nCommercial Real Estate Supply and Demand\nOur business is dependent on the willingness of investors to invest in or sell commercial real estate, which is affected by factors beyond our control. These factors include the supply of commercial real estate coupled with user demand for these properties and the performance of real estate assets when compared with other investment alternatives, such as stocks and bonds.\nCommercial real estate supply and demand remain in alignment, with vacancy rates generally holding steady at cycle-low\nlevels. The tight labor market and the accelerated pace of household formation continues to drive strong apartment housing demand, particularly in the workforce housing segments. Real estate sectors supported by consumption and discretionary spending remain stable, with hotel and self-storage space demand outpacing historical averages, while retail demand has balanced with the very limited construction levels. Industrial space demand, which has been more sensitive to risks sparked by the trade war and other international factors, has tapered in recent months, curtailing space absorption. In conjunction with elevated big-box\nconstruction, industrial vacancy levels have ticked up from the record-low\nlevels set last year. Office space demand remains stable as positive job creation balances with decreased square footage per employee to keep vacancy rates flat.\nCapital Markets\nCredit and liquidity issues in the financial markets have a direct impact on the flow of capital to the commercial real estate market. Real estate purchases are often financed with debt and, as a result, credit and liquidity impact transaction activity and prices. Changes in interest rates, as well as steady and protracted movements of interest rates in one direction, whether increases or decreases, could adversely or positively affect the operations and income potential of commercial real estate properties, as well as lender and equity underwriting for real estate investments. These changes influence the demand of investors for commercial real estate investments.\nMarket liquidity remains elevated despite lenders' modest tightening of underwriting standards. The broad range of capital sources, including the increased multifamily lending available through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, may sustain mainstream lending activity. Capital available for value-add\nconcepts and outlying markets appears to remain strong, but often includes secondary and mezzanine financing options. The Federal Reserve's commitment to keeping rates low, reiterated at their January 2020 meeting, has helped keep the 10-year\nTreasury in the 1.6% range, exceptionally low by historical measures. This could offer buyers increased positive leverage, which could support more aggressive bids on acquisitions, but sellers continue to price assets at a premium, keeping the bid-ask\nspread widened. Sales activity continues to fluctuate on a quarter-by-quarter\nbasis.\nInvestor Sentiment and Investment Activity\nWe rely on investors to buy and sell properties in order to generate commissions. Investors' desires to engage in real estate transactions are dependent on many factors that are beyond our control. The economy, supply and demand for properly positioned properties, available credit and market events impact investor sentiment and, therefore, transaction velocity. In addition, our private clients are often motivated to buy, sell and/or refinance properties due to personal circumstances such as death, divorce, partnership breakups and estate planning.\nLow interest rates and steady yields have continued to attract investment to real estate through direct investment as well as a multitude of REITs, equity funds and syndication options. Despite the compelling yield options and strong fundamentals across most property types, buyers remain cautious about the economic outlook and risks that may emerge during their target hold period. In many cases, investors are underwriting to a more conservative long-term outlook. Sellers, however, have been slow to reduce asking prices, and a transactional hurdle has emerged. The gap in pricing expectations is expected to remain a modest but steady headwind, extending asset marketing and closing timelines.\nSeasonality\nOur real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees have tended to be seasonal and, combined with other factors, can affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter\nbasis. Historically, this seasonality has generally caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. The concentration of earnings and cash flows in the last six months of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, is due to an industry-wide focus of clients to complete transactions towards the end of the calendar year. This historical trend can be disrupted both positively and negatively by major economic or political events impacting investor sentiment for a particular property type or location, volatility in financial markets, current and future projections of interest rates, attractiveness of other asset classes, market liquidity and the extent of limitations or availability of capital allocations for larger property buyers, among others. Private client investors may accelerate or delay transactions due to personal or business-related reasons unrelated to economic events. In addition, our operating margins are typically lower during the second half of each year due to our commission structure for some of our senior investment sales and financing professionals. These senior investment sales and financing professionals are on a graduated commission schedule that resets annually, pursuant to which higher commissions are paid for higher sales volumes. Our historical pattern of seasonality may or may not continue to the same degree experienced in prior years.\nOperating Segments\nWe follow the guidance for segment reporting, which requires reporting information on operating segments in interim and annual financial statements. Substantially all of our operations involve the delivery of commercial real estate services to our customers including real estate investment sales, financing and consulting and advisory services. Management makes operating decisions, assesses performance and allocates resources based on an ongoing review of these integrated operations, which constitute only one operating segment for financial reporting purposes.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily generated from our real estate investment sales business. In addition to real estate brokerage commissions, we generate revenues from financing fees and from other revenues, which are primarily comprised of consulting and advisory fees.\nBecause our business is transaction oriented, we rely on investment sales and financing professionals to continually develop leads, identify properties to sell, market those properties and close the sale timely to generate a consistent flow of revenue. While our sales volume is impacted by seasonality factors, the timing of closings is also dependent on many market and personal factors unique to a particular client or transaction, particularly clients transacting in the $1-$10\nmillion private client market segment. These factors can cause transactions to be accelerated or delayed beyond our control. Further, commission rates earned are generally inversely related to the value of the property sold. As a result of our expansion into the middle and larger transaction market segments, we have seen our overall commission rates fluctuate from period-to-period\nas a result of changes in the relative\nmix of the number and volume of investment sales transactions closed in the middle and larger transaction market segments as compared to the $1-$10\nmillion private client market segment. These factors may result in period-to-period\nvariations in our revenues that differ from historical patterns.\nA small percentage of our transactions include retainer fees and/or breakage fees. Retainer fees are credited against a success-based fee paid upon the closing of a transaction or a breakage fee. Transactions that are terminated before completion will sometimes generate breakage fees, which are usually calculated as a set amount or a percentage of the fee we would have received had the transaction closed.\nReal estate brokerage commissions\nWe earn real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for commercial real estate owners seeking to sell or investors seeking to buy properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions are typically recognized at the close of escrow.\nFinancing fees\nWe earn financing fees by securing financing on purchase transactions or by securing refinancing of our clients' existing mortgage debt. We recognize financing fee revenues at the time the loan closes, and we have no remaining significant obligations for performance in connection with the transaction. To a lesser extent, we also earn mortgage servicing revenue, mortgage servicing fees and ancillary fees associated with financing activities. We recognize mortgage servicing revenues upon the acquisition of a servicing obligation. We generate mortgage servicing fees through the provision of collection, remittance, recordkeeping, reporting and other related mortgage servicing functions, activities and services.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues include fees generated from consulting and advisory services performed by our investment sales professionals, as well as referral fees from other real estate brokers. Revenues from these services are recognized as they are performed and completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization. The significant components of our expenses are further described below.\nCost of services\nThe majority of our cost of services expense is variable commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities. Commission expenses are directly attributable to providing services to our clients for investment sales and financing services. Most of our investment sales and financing professionals are independent contractors and are paid commissions; however, because there are some who are initially paid a salary and certain of our financing professionals are employees, costs of services also include employee-related compensation, employer taxes and benefits for those employees. The commission rates we pay to our investment sales and financing professionals vary based on individual contracts negotiated and are generally higher for the more experienced professionals. Some of our most senior investment sales and financing professionals also have the ability to earn additional commissions after meeting certain annual revenue thresholds. These additional commissions are recognized as cost of services in the period in which they are earned. Payment of a portion of these additional commissions are generally deferred for a period of three years, at our election, and paid at the beginning of the fourth calendar year. Cost of services also includes referral fees paid to other real estate brokers where we are the principal service provider. Cost of services, therefore, can vary based on the commission structure of the independent contractors that closed transactions in any particular period.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe largest expense component within selling, general and administrative expenses is personnel expenses for our management team and sales and support staff. In addition, these costs include facilities costs (excluding depreciation and amortization), staff related expenses, sales, marketing, legal, telecommunication, network, data sources, transaction costs related to acquisitions, changes in fair value for contingent consideration and other administrative expenses. Also included in selling, general and administrative are expenses for stock-based compensation to non-employee\ndirectors, employees and independent contractors (i.e. investment sales and financing professionals) under the Amended and Restated 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan ( 2013 Plan\u201d) and the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP\u201d).\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation expense consists of depreciation recorded on our computer software and hardware and furniture, fixture and equipment. Depreciation is provided over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years for owned assets. Amortization expense consists of (i) amortization recorded on our mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs\u201d) using the interest method over the period that servicing income is expected to be received and (ii) amortization recorded on intangible assets amortized on a straight-line basis using a useful life between one and six years.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income, net gains or losses on our deferred compensation plan assets, realized gains and losses on our marketable securities, available-for-sale,\nforeign currency gains and losses and other non-operating\ngains and losses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with the stock appreciation rights ( SARs\u201d) liability, notes payable to former stockholders and our credit agreement.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. and Canadian federal taxes and individual state and local taxes based on the income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the change in the mix of our activities in the jurisdictions we operate due to differing tax rates in those jurisdictions and other permanent items. Our provision for income taxes includes the windfall tax benefits, net, from shares issued in connection with our 2013 Plan and ESPP.\nWe record deferred taxes, net based on the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time those items are expected to be recognized for tax purposes.\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The tables included in the period comparisons below provide summaries of our results of operations. The period-to-period\ncomparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. During the years\nended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we closed more than 9,700, 9,400 and 8,900 investment sales, financing and other transactions, respectively, with total sales volume of approximately $49.7 billion, $46.4 billion and $42.2 billion, respectively. Such key metrics for real estate brokerage and financing activities (excluding other transactions) are as follows:\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measure.\u201d </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nOur total revenues were $806.4 million in 2019 compared to $814.8 million in 2018, a decrease of $8.4 million, or 1.0%. Total revenues decreased as a result of decreased real estate brokerage commissions, partially offset by increases in financing fees and other revenues, as described below.\nReal estate brokerage commissions.\nRevenues from real estate brokerage commissions decreased to $729.4 million in 2019 from $747.4 million in 2018, a decrease of $18.0 million, or 2.4%. The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in the average commission rate to 1.98% in 2019 compared to 2.07% in 2018 despite the 2.2% increase in total investment sales volume in 2019 compared to 2018. The 9 basis point decrease in average commission rate was the result of the 2.7% increase in the average transaction size. Commission rates for larger investment sales are generally lower than commission rates for smaller sales.\nFinancing fees.\nRevenues from financing fees increased to $66.3 million in 2019 from $57.8 million in 2018, an increase of $8.5 million, or 14.7%. The increase was in part spurred by growth from acquisitions during 2018 and was primarily driven by a 15.1% increase in financing volume. The increase in financing volume was in part due to an increase in refinancing activity resulting from a reduction in interest rates. The average fee rate for 2019 was comparable to the average fee rate for 2018. Financing volume was primarily impacted by the 15.9% increase in the number of financing transactions as there was little change in the average transaction size.\nOther revenues.\nOther revenues increased to $10.8 million in 2019 from $9.6 million in 2018, an increase of $1.1 million or 11.8%. The increase was primarily driven by increases in consulting and advisory services during 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.\nTotal operating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $710.0 million in 2019 compared to $702.5 million in 2018, an increase of $7.5 million, or 1.1%. The increase was primarily due to increases in selling, general and administrative costs and to a lesser extent depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in costs of services, which are primarily variable commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation related costs in connection with our financing activities, as described below.\nCost of services.\nCost of services in 2019 decreased $4.0 million, or 0.8%, to $498.9 million from $502.9 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to decreased commission expenses driven by the related decreased total revenues noted above. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues slightly increased to 61.9% for 2019 compared to 61.7% for 2018 primarily due to mix in brokerage compensation.\nSelling, general and administrative expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expense in 2019 increased $9.8 million, or 5.0%, to $203.1 million from $193.3 million in 2018. Increases in our selling, general and administrative expense have been driven by our growth plans and investments in technology, sales and marketing tools and marketing and expansion of our services supporting our investment sales and financing professionals. These initiatives have primarily driven (i) a $7.2 million increase in sales operations support and promotional marketing expenses; (ii) a $3.2 million increase in facilities expenses due to expansion of offices; (iii) a $3.1 million increase in net other expense categories, primarily driven by an increase in certain licensing fees; and (iv) a $0.1 million increase in compensation related costs, primarily driven by increases in salaries and related benefits and deferred compensation obligations, partially offset by the reduction in management compensation. These increases were partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation primarily driven by the restricted stock units, which were granted in connection with our initial public offering, vesting in full in January 2019, and a $1.1 million decrease in legal costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $8.0 million in 2019 from $6.3 million in 2018, an increase of $1.7 million, or 27.3%. The increase was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets, capital expenditures due to our expansion and growth and MSRs.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net increased to $12.5 million in 2019 from $6.3 million in 2018, an increase of $6.1 million, or 97.0%. The increase was primarily driven by increases in interest income on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale,\nan increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan assets and foreign currency gains (losses).\nInterest expense\nThere were no significant changes in interest expenses in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $30.6 million for 2019 compared to $30.0 million in 2018, an increase of $0.6 million, or 2.1%. The effective tax rate for 2019 was 28.4%, compared with 25.6% in 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced windfall tax benefits recognized in 2019 compared to $1.5 million recognized in 2018 primarily as a result of no deferred stock units settling in 2019, an increase in our consolidated state tax rate and an increase in the valuation allowance with respect to our Canadian operations.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nA discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2017 can be found under Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019, which is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov\nand the Investor Relations section of our website at www.MarcusMillichap.com\n.\nNon-GAAP\nFinancial Measure\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nwe include a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, adjusted earnings before interest income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and other non-cash\nitems, or Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest income and other, including net realized gains (losses) on marketable securities, available-for-sale\nand cash and cash equivalents, (ii) interest expense, (iii) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) stock-based compensation, and (vi) non-cash\nMSR activity. We use Adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to evaluate the performance of our business, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets, among other things. We also believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate our overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. We find Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance, because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items related to capital structure, taxes and non-cash\nitems. In light of the foregoing limitations, we do not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also consider our U.S. GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 76,930\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 87,257\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 51,524\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 64,657\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 66,350\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income and other(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (10,322\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7,052\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,514\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,761\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,373\n</td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,388\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,496\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,533\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,726\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30,582\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,963\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,702\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42,445\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,297\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,363\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,387\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,305\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,278\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11,983\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,145\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,035\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,114\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash\nMSR activity(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (322\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (391\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 115,551\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 129,457\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 111,716\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 118,296\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 124,140\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>Other includes net realized gains (losses) on marketable securities available-for-sale.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>The year ended December 31, 2017, includes a one-time\ncharge in the amount of $11.6 million in connection with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets, net due to enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% starting in 2018. In addition, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement in 2017 that required any windfall tax benefits, net of shortfalls to be recorded as a discrete item in our provision for income taxes. Prior to 2017, windfalls tax benefits, net were recorded directly to additional paid in capital. These windfalls/shortfalls arise from the difference in the grant date price and the vesting date price of employee and non-employee\ndirectors vesting of equity awards granted under our 2013 Plan. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>Non-cash\nMSR activity includes the assumption of servicing obligations. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>(4)\n</td> <td>The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is primarily due to lower total revenues and a higher proportion of operating expenses compared to total revenues. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, marketable securities, available-for-sale\nand, if necessary, borrowings under our credit agreement. In order to enhance yield to us, we have invested a portion of our cash in money market funds and in fixed and variable income debt securities, in accordance with our investment policy approved by the board of directors. Certain of our investments in money market funds may not maintain a stable net asset value and may impose fees on redemptions and/or gate fees. Although we have historically funded our operations through operating cash flows, there can be no assurance that we can continue to meet our cash requirements entirely through our operations, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale\nor availability under our credit agreement.\nCash Flows\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $18.0 million to $232.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $214.7 million at December 31, 2018.

Cash flows provided by operating activities were $25.3 million in 2019 compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $117.3 million in 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash\nitems and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $92.0 million decrease in operating cash flows for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in our real estate brokerage revenue and a higher proportion of operating expenses compared to total revenues, differences in timing of certain payments and receipts, an increase in advances to our investment sales and financing professionals, an increase in bonus payments in 2019 related to bonuses earned based on 2018 performance, and a reduction in the discretionary deferral of certain commissions.\nInvesting Activities\n2019 Compared to 2018\n. Cash flows used in investing activities were $3.4 million for 2019 compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $118.0 million for the same period in 2018. The $114.6 million decreased usage in cash for investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to $11.6 million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, available-for-sale\nfor 2019 compared to $94.5 million in net purchases of marketable securities, available-for-sale\nfor 2018 and an additional net $8.8 million of outflow for acquisitions in 2018 over acquisition activity in 2019. See Note 6 - Acquisitions, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFinancing Activities\n2019 Compared to 2018\n. Cash flows used in financing activities were $3.9 million for 2019 compared to $5.4 million for the same period in 2018. The change in cash flows used in financing activities for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily impacted by taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock-based awards and payments for contingent consideration in 2019 with no such comparable outflow for the same period in 2019. See Note 12 - Stock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLiquidity\nWe believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows expected to be generated from our operations, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale\nand borrowings available under the Credit Agreement (defined below) will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. If we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could prevent us from, among other factors, to fund acquisitions or to otherwise finance our growth or operations. In addition, our notes payable to former stockholders and SARs agreements have provisions, which could accelerate repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest and adversely impact our liquidity.\nCredit Agreement\nWe have a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association for a $60.0 million principal amount senior secured revolving credit facility that is guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries and matures on June 1, 2022 (the Credit Agreement\u201d). See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Credit Agreement.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe contractual obligations and other commitments consisted of the following at December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> More\nThan 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Other(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease liabilities, including imputed interest(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 89,241\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 21,262\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 33,889\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 21,317\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 12,773\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SARs liability (principal and interest)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,880\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,408\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,334\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,058\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable (principal and interest)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,897\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,897\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred commissions payable(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34,158\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,339\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,819\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred compensation liability(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,241\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,553\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,126\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,528\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent consideration(6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,788\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,238\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,163\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,142\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 245\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,146\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,235\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 911\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 171,351\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 47,604\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 63,405\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 24,827\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 30,076\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 5,439\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>See Note 4 - Operating Leases\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>Forecasted principal payments are based on each participant's estimated retirement age and contractual interest rate of 3.920% on January 1, 2020 and reflect required payments that result from the retirement of certain executives.

The ultimate resolution depends on many factors and assumptions; accordingly, we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of such payments, if any. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nOur commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation. However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies; Use of Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective and our actual results may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nWe believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to (i) differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and (ii) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure existing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to have temporary differences realized or settled. We recognize in the provision for income taxes, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. We periodically evaluate the deferred tax assets to assess whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, we consider the timing of deferred tax reversals, current year taxable income and historical performance. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not\nthat some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBecause of the nature of our business, which includes activity in the U.S. and Canada, incorporating numerous states and provinces as well as local jurisdictions, our tax position can be complex. As such, our effective tax rate is subject to changes as a result of fluctuations in the mix of our activity in various jurisdictions in which we operate including changes in tax rates, state apportionment, tax related interest and penalties, valuation allowances and other permanent items. Calculating some of the amounts involves a high degree of judgment.\nWe evaluate our tax positions quarterly. The threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained by the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not\ncriterion, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized. We assess our inventory of tax positions with respect to all applicable income tax issues for all open tax years (in each respective jurisdiction) and determine whether uncertain tax positions are required to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe recognize interest and penalties incurred as income tax expense.\nLeases\nWe utilize operating leases for all our facilities and autos. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use\nassets ( ROU assets\u201d) represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our contractual obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Operating leases are included in the operating lease ROU assets, non-current,\nand operating lease liabilities, current and non-current,\ncaptions in the consolidated balance sheets.\nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease agreements may contain periods of free rent or reduced rent, predetermined fixed increases in the minimum rent and renewal or termination options, all of which add complexity and impact the determination of the lease term and lease payments to be used in calculating the lease liability. Certain facility leases provide for rental escalations related to increases in the lessors' direct operating expenses. We use the implicit rate in the lease when determinable. As most of our leases do not have a determinable implicit rate, determining the rate to be used in our calculations is judgmental. We use a derived incremental borrowing rate based on borrowing options under our credit agreement and apply a spread over treasury rates for the indicated term of the lease based on the information available on the commencement date of the lease. We typically lease general purpose built-out\noffice space, which reverts to the lessor upon termination of the lease. Any payments for completed improvements, determined to be owed by the lessor, net of incentives received, are recorded as an increase to the ROU asset and considered in the determination of the lease cost.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease\ncomponents, which are accounted for as a single lease component. Lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments consist of common area costs, insurance, taxes utilities, parking and other lease related costs, which are determined principally based on billings from landlords.\nInvestments in Marketable Securities, Available-for-Sale\nWe maintain a portfolio of investments in a variety of fixed and variable rate debt securities, including U.S. treasuries, U.S. government sponsored entities, corporate debt, asset-backed securities and other. We consider our investment in marketable securities to be available-for-sale.\nAccordingly, these investments are recorded at their fair values, with unrealized gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We determine the appropriate classification of investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase. Interest along with accretion and amortization of purchase premiums and discounts from the purchase date through the estimated maturity date, including consideration of variable maturities and contractual call provisions, are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of net and comprehensive income. See Note 5 - Investments in Marketable Securities\u201d for additional information.\nWe regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. Calculating an impairment charge requires a high degree of judgment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other items, the time frame and extent to which the fair market value of a security is less than its amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates and our intent and ability to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. We typically invest in highly-rated securities, and our investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss and matching long-term liabilities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 - Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe accounting pronouncement related to leases had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 but did not have a material impact on the consolidated statement of net and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2019. Although we do not believe any of the other accounting pronouncements listed in that note will have a significant impact on our business, we are still in the process of determining the impact of the new pronouncements may have on our consolidated financial statements.", "summary": "- The provided text appears to be a financial report presenting information about multiple accounts\n- The report

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Factors Affecting Our Business\n\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur Business\nWe are a leading national brokerage firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services. We have been the top commercial real estate investment broker in the United States based on the number of investment transactions over the last 10 years. As of December 31, 2019, we had 2,021 investment sales and financing professionals that are primarily exclusive independent contractors operating in 82 offices who provide real estate brokerage and financing services to sellers and buyers of commercial real estate. We also offer market research, consulting and advisory services to our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we closed 9,726 investment sales, financing and other transactions with total sales volume of approximately $49.7 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed 9,472 sales, financing and other transactions with total sales volume of approximately $46.4 billion.\nWe generate revenues by collecting real estate brokerage commissions upon the sale, and fees upon the financing of, commercial properties and by providing consulting and advisory services. Real estate brokerage commissions are typically based upon the value of the property, and financing fees are typically based upon the size of the loan. During the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 91% of our revenues were generated from real estate brokerage commissions, 8% from financing fees and 1% from other revenues, including consulting and advisory services.\nDuring 2019, we acquired one business that was accounted for as a business combination and the results have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. This acquisition expanded our network of real estate sales professionals and provided further diversification to our real estate brokerage services.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOur business and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity are significantly affected by the number and size of commercial real estate investment sales and financing transactions that we close in any period. The number and size of these transactions are affected by our ability to recruit and retain investment sales and financing professionals, identify and contract properties for sale and identify those that need financing and refinancing. We principally monitor the commercial real estate market through four factors, which generally drive our business. The factors are the economy, commercial real estate supply and demand, capital markets and investor sentiment and investment activity.\nThe Economy\nOur business is dependent on economic conditions within the markets in which we operate. Changes in the economy on a global, national, regional or local basis can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Economic indicators and projections related to job growth, unemployment, interest rates, retail spending and confidence trends can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Overall market conditions, including global trade, interest rate changes and job creation, can affect investor sentiment and, ultimately, the demand for our services from investors in real estate.\nThe U.S. economy maintained moderate, but steady growth in the fourth quarter of 2019. It appears the low inflation, low unemployment climate has granted the Federal Reserve policy latitude, allowing them to maintain low interest rates. Steady job creation, averaging 176,000 (based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics) positions per month last year, and moderate wage growth may sustain above-average household formation and consumption levels, contributing to economic growth this year. This momentum may be partially offset by uncertainty surrounding the upcoming elections, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and concerns about the potential contagion risks of the Coronavirus.\nCommercial Real Estate Supply and Demand\nOur business is dependent on the willingness of investors to invest in or sell commercial real estate, which is affected by factors beyond our control. These factors include the supply of commercial real estate coupled with user demand for these properties and the performance of real estate assets when compared with other investment alternatives, such as stocks and bonds.\nCommercial real estate supply and demand remain in alignment, with vacancy rates generally holding steady at cycle-low\nlevels. The tight labor market and the accelerated pace of household formation continues to drive strong apartment housing demand, particularly in the workforce housing segments. Real estate sectors supported by consumption and discretionary spending remain stable, with hotel and self-storage space demand outpacing historical averages, while retail demand has balanced with the very limited construction levels. Industrial space demand, which has been more sensitive to risks sparked by the trade war and other international factors, has tapered in recent months, curtailing space absorption. In conjunction with elevated big-box\nconstruction, industrial vacancy levels have ticked up from the record-low\nlevels set last year. Office space demand remains stable as positive job creation balances with decreased square footage per employee to keep vacancy rates flat.\nCapital Markets\nCredit and liquidity issues in the financial markets have a direct impact on the flow of capital to the commercial real estate market. Real estate purchases are often financed with debt and, as a result, credit and liquidity impact transaction activity and prices. Changes in interest rates, as well as steady and protracted movements of interest rates in one direction, whether increases or decreases, could adversely or positively affect the operations and income potential of commercial real estate properties, as well as lender and equity underwriting for real estate investments. These changes influence the demand of investors for commercial real estate investments.\nMarket liquidity remains elevated despite lenders' modest tightening of underwriting standards. The broad range of capital sources, including the increased multifamily lending available through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, may sustain mainstream lending activity. Capital available for value-add\nconcepts and outlying markets appears to remain strong, but often includes secondary and mezzanine financing options. The Federal Reserve's commitment to keeping rates low, reiterated at their January 2020 meeting, has helped keep the 10-year\nTreasury in the 1.6% range, exceptionally low by historical measures. This could offer buyers increased positive leverage, which could support more aggressive bids on acquisitions, but sellers continue to price assets at a premium, keeping the bid-ask\nspread widened. Sales activity continues to fluctuate on a quarter-by-quarter\nbasis.\nInvestor Sentiment and Investment Activity\nWe rely on investors to buy and sell properties in order to generate commissions. Investors' desires to engage in real estate transactions are dependent on many factors that are beyond our control. The economy, supply and demand for properly positioned properties, available credit and market events impact investor sentiment and, therefore, transaction velocity. In addition, our private clients are often motivated to buy, sell and/or refinance properties due to personal circumstances such as death, divorce, partnership breakups and estate planning.\nLow interest rates and steady yields have continued to attract investment to real estate through direct investment as well as a multitude of REITs, equity funds and syndication options. Despite the compelling yield options and strong fundamentals across most property types, buyers remain cautious about the economic outlook and risks that may emerge during their target hold period. In many cases, investors are underwriting to a more conservative long-term outlook. Sellers, however, have been slow to reduce asking prices, and a transactional hurdle has emerged. The gap in pricing expectations is expected to remain a modest but steady headwind, extending asset marketing and closing timelines.\nSeasonality\nOur real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees have tended to be seasonal and, combined with other factors, can affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter\nbasis. Historically, this seasonality has generally caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. The concentration of earnings and cash flows in the last six months of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, is due to an industry-wide focus of clients to complete transactions towards the end of the calendar year. This historical trend can be disrupted both positively and negatively by major economic or political events impacting investor sentiment for a particular property type or location, volatility in financial markets, current and future projections of interest rates, attractiveness of other asset classes, market liquidity and the extent of limitations or availability of capital allocations for larger property buyers, among others. Private client investors may accelerate or delay transactions due to personal or business-related reasons unrelated to economic events. In addition, our operating margins are typically lower during the second half of each year due to our commission structure for some of our senior investment sales and financing professionals. These senior investment sales and financing professionals are on a graduated commission schedule that resets annually, pursuant to which higher commissions are paid for higher sales volumes. Our historical pattern of seasonality may or may not continue to the same degree experienced in prior years.\nOperating Segments\nWe follow the guidance for segment reporting, which requires reporting information on operating segments in interim and annual financial statements. Substantially all of our operations involve the delivery of commercial real estate services to our customers including real estate investment sales, financing and consulting and advisory services. Management makes operating decisions, assesses performance and allocates resources based on an ongoing review of these integrated operations, which constitute only one operating segment for financial reporting purposes.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily generated from our real estate investment sales business. In addition to real estate brokerage commissions, we generate revenues from financing fees and from other revenues, which are primarily comprised of consulting and advisory fees.\nBecause our business is transaction oriented, we rely on investment sales and financing professionals to continually develop leads, identify properties to sell, market those properties and close the sale timely to generate a consistent flow of revenue. While our sales volume is impacted by seasonality factors, the timing of closings is also dependent on many market and personal factors unique to a particular client or transaction, particularly clients transacting in the $1-$10\nmillion private client market segment. These factors can cause transactions to be accelerated or delayed beyond our control. Further, commission rates earned are generally inversely related to the value of the property sold. As a result of our expansion into the middle and larger transaction market segments, we have seen our overall commission rates fluctuate from period-to-period\nas a result of changes in the relative\nmix of the number and volume of investment sales transactions closed in the middle and larger transaction market segments as compared to the $1-$10\nmillion private client market segment. These factors may result in period-to-period\nvariations in our revenues that differ from historical patterns.\nA small percentage of our transactions include retainer fees and/or breakage fees. Retainer fees are credited against a success-based fee paid upon the closing of a transaction or a breakage fee. Transactions that are terminated before completion will sometimes generate breakage fees, which are usually calculated as a set amount or a percentage of the fee we would have received had the transaction closed.\nReal estate brokerage commissions\nWe earn real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for commercial real estate owners seeking to sell or investors seeking to buy properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions are typically recognized at the close of escrow.\nFinancing fees\nWe earn financing fees by securing financing on purchase transactions or by securing refinancing of our clients' existing mortgage debt. We recognize financing fee revenues at the time the loan closes, and we have no remaining significant obligations for performance in connection with the transaction. To a lesser extent, we also earn mortgage servicing revenue, mortgage servicing fees and ancillary fees associated with financing activities. We recognize mortgage servicing revenues upon the acquisition of a servicing obligation. We generate mortgage servicing fees through the provision of collection, remittance, recordkeeping, reporting and other related mortgage servicing functions, activities and services.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues include fees generated from consulting and advisory services performed by our investment sales professionals, as well as referral fees from other real estate brokers. Revenues from these services are recognized as they are performed and completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization. The significant components of our expenses are further described below.\nCost of services\nThe majority of our cost of services expense is variable commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities. Commission expenses are directly attributable to providing services to our clients for investment sales and financing services. Most of our investment sales and financing professionals are independent contractors and are paid commissions; however, because there are some who are initially paid a salary and certain of our financing professionals are employees, costs of services also include employee-related compensation, employer taxes and benefits for those employees. The commission rates we pay to our investment sales and financing professionals vary based on individual contracts negotiated and are generally higher for the more experienced professionals. Some of our most senior investment sales and financing professionals also have the ability to earn additional commissions after meeting certain annual revenue thresholds. These additional commissions are recognized as cost of services in the period in which they are earned. Payment of a portion of these additional commissions are generally deferred for a period of three years, at our election, and paid at the beginning of the fourth calendar year. Cost of services also includes referral fees paid to other real estate brokers where we are the principal service provider. Cost of services, therefore, can vary based on the commission structure of the independent contractors that closed transactions in any particular period.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe largest expense component within selling, general and administrative expenses is personnel expenses for our management team and sales and support staff. In addition, these costs include facilities costs (excluding depreciation and amortization), staff related expenses, sales, marketing, legal, telecommunication, network, data sources, transaction costs related to acquisitions, changes in fair value for contingent consideration and other administrative expenses. Also included in selling, general and administrative are expenses for stock-based compensation to non-employee\ndirectors, employees and independent contractors (i.e. investment sales and financing professionals) under the Amended and Restated 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan ( 2013 Plan\u201d) and the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP\u201d).\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation expense consists of depreciation recorded on our computer software and hardware and furniture, fixture and equipment. Depreciation is provided over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years for owned assets. Amortization expense consists of (i) amortization recorded on our mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs\u201d) using the interest method over the period that servicing income is expected to be received and (ii) amortization recorded on intangible assets amortized on a straight-line basis using a useful life between one and six years.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income, net gains or losses on our deferred compensation plan assets, realized gains and losses on our marketable securities, available-for-sale,\nforeign currency gains and losses and other non-operating\ngains and losses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with the stock appreciation rights ( SARs\u201d) liability, notes payable to former stockholders and our credit agreement.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. and Canadian federal taxes and individual state and local taxes based on the income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the change in the mix of our activities in the jurisdictions we operate due to differing tax rates in those jurisdictions and other permanent items. Our provision for income taxes includes the windfall tax benefits, net, from shares issued in connection with our 2013 Plan and ESPP.\nWe record deferred taxes, net based on the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time those items are expected to be recognized for tax purposes.\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The tables included in the period comparisons below provide summaries of our results of operations. The period-to-period\ncomparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. During the years\nended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we closed more than 9,700, 9,400 and 8,900 investment sales, financing and other transactions, respectively, with total sales volume of approximately $49.7 billion, $46.4 billion and $42.2 billion, respectively. Such key metrics for real estate brokerage and financing activities (excluding other transactions) are as follows:\n\n\n (1) Operating metrics calculated excluding certain financing fees not directly associated to transactions. \nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nBelow are key operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\n\nRevenues\nOur total revenues were $806.4 million in 2019 compared to $814.8 million in 2018, a decrease of $8.4 million, or 1.0%. Total revenues decreased as a result of decreased real estate brokerage commissions, partially offset by increases in financing fees and other revenues, as described below.\nReal estate brokerage commissions.\nRevenues from real estate brokerage commissions decreased to $729.4 million in 2019 from $747.4 million in 2018, a decrease of $18.0 million, or 2.4%. The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in the average commission rate to 1.98% in 2019 compared to 2.07% in 2018 despite the 2.2% increase in total investment sales volume in 2019 compared to 2018. The 9 basis point decrease in average commission rate was the result of the 2.7% increase in the average transaction size. Commission rates for larger investment sales are generally lower than commission rates for smaller sales.\nFinancing fees.\nRevenues from financing fees increased to $66.3 million in 2019 from $57.8 million in 2018, an increase of $8.5 million, or 14.7%. The increase was in part spurred by growth from acquisitions during 2018 and was primarily driven by a 15.1% increase in financing volume. The increase in financing volume was in part due to an increase in refinancing activity resulting from a reduction in interest rates. The average fee rate for 2019 was comparable to the average fee rate for 2018. Financing volume was primarily impacted by the 15.9% increase in the number of financing transactions as there was little change in the average transaction size.\nOther revenues.\nOther revenues increased to $10.8 million in 2019 from $9.6 million in 2018, an increase of $1.1 million or 11.8%. The increase was primarily driven by increases in consulting and advisory services during 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.\nTotal operating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $710.0 million in 2019 compared to $702.5 million in 2018, an increase of $7.5 million, or 1.1%. The increase was primarily due to increases in selling, general and administrative costs and to a lesser extent depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in costs of services, which are primarily variable commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation related costs in connection with our financing activities, as described below.\nCost of services.\nCost of services in 2019 decreased $4.0 million, or 0.8%, to $498.9 million from $502.9 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to decreased commission expenses driven by the related decreased total revenues noted above. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues slightly increased to 61.9% for 2019 compared to 61.7% for 2018 primarily due to mix in brokerage compensation.\nSelling, general and administrative expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expense in 2019 increased $9.8 million, or 5.0%, to $203.1 million from $193.3 million in 2018. Increases in our selling, general and administrative expense have been driven by our growth plans and investments in technology, sales and marketing tools and marketing and expansion of our services supporting our investment sales and financing professionals. These initiatives have primarily driven (i) a $7.2 million increase in sales operations support and promotional marketing expenses; (ii) a $3.2 million increase in facilities expenses due to expansion of offices; (iii) a $3.1 million increase in net other expense categories, primarily driven by an increase in certain licensing fees; and (iv) a $0.1 million increase in compensation related costs, primarily driven by increases in salaries and related benefits and deferred compensation obligations, partially offset by the reduction in management compensation. These increases were partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation primarily driven by the restricted stock units, which were granted in connection with our initial public offering, vesting in full in January 2019, and a $1.1 million decrease in legal costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $8.0 million in 2019 from $6.3 million in 2018, an increase of $1.7 million, or 27.3%. The increase was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets, capital expenditures due to our expansion and growth and MSRs.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net increased to $12.5 million in 2019 from $6.3 million in 2018, an increase of $6.1 million, or 97.0%. The increase was primarily driven by increases in interest income on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale,\nan increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan assets and foreign currency gains (losses).\nInterest expense\nThere were no significant changes in interest expenses in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $30.6 million for 2019 compared to $30.0 million in 2018, an increase of $0.6 million, or 2.1%. The effective tax rate for 2019 was 28.4%, compared with 25.6% in 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced windfall tax benefits recognized in 2019 compared to $1.5 million recognized in 2018 primarily as a result of no deferred stock units settling in 2019, an increase in our consolidated state tax rate and an increase in the valuation allowance with respect to our Canadian operations.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nA discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2017 can be found under Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019, which is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov\nand the Investor Relations section of our website at www.MarcusMillichap.com\n.\nNon-GAAP\nFinancial Measure\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nwe include a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, adjusted earnings before interest income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and other non-cash\nitems, or Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest income and other, including net realized gains (losses) on marketable securities, available-for-sale\nand cash and cash equivalents, (ii) interest expense, (iii) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) stock-based compensation, and (vi) non-cash\nMSR activity. We use Adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to evaluate the performance of our business, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets, among other things. We also believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate our overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. We find Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance, because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items related to capital structure, taxes and non-cash\nitems. In light of the foregoing limitations, we do not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also consider our U.S. GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) Other includes net realized gains (losses) on marketable securities available-for-sale. \n\n\n (4) The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is primarily due to lower total revenues and a higher proportion of operating expenses compared to total revenues. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, marketable securities, available-for-sale\nand, if necessary, borrowings under our credit agreement. In order to enhance yield to us, we have invested a portion of our cash in money market funds and in fixed and variable income debt securities, in accordance with our investment policy approved by the board of directors. Certain of our investments in money market funds may not maintain a stable net asset value and may impose fees on redemptions and/or gate fees. Although we have historically funded our operations through operating cash flows, there can be no assurance that we can continue to meet our cash requirements entirely through our operations, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale\nor availability under our credit agreement.\nCash Flows\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $18.0 million to $232.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $214.7 million at December 31, 2018. The following table sets forth our summary cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\n2019 Compared to 2018\n. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $25.3 million in 2019 compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $117.3 million in 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash\nitems and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $92.0 million decrease in operating cash flows for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in our real estate brokerage revenue and a higher proportion of operating expenses compared to total revenues, differences in timing of certain payments and receipts, an increase in advances to our investment sales and financing professionals, an increase in bonus payments in 2019 related to bonuses earned based on 2018 performance, and a reduction in the discretionary deferral of certain commissions.\nInvesting Activities\n2019 Compared to 2018\n. Cash flows used in investing activities were $3.4 million for 2019 compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $118.0 million for the same period in 2018. The $114.6 million decreased usage in cash for investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to $11.6 million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, available-for-sale\nfor 2019 compared to $94.5 million in net purchases of marketable securities, available-for-sale\nfor 2018 and an additional net $8.8 million of outflow for acquisitions in 2018 over acquisition activity in 2019. See Note 6 - Acquisitions, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFinancing Activities\n2019 Compared to 2018\n. Cash flows used in financing activities were $3.9 million for 2019 compared to $5.4 million for the same period in 2018. The change in cash flows used in financing activities for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily impacted by taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock-based awards and payments for contingent consideration in 2019 with no such comparable outflow for the same period in 2019. See Note 12 - Stock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLiquidity\nWe believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows expected to be generated from our operations, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale\nand borrowings available under the Credit Agreement (defined below) will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. If we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could prevent us from, among other factors, to fund acquisitions or to otherwise finance our growth or operations. In addition, our notes payable to former stockholders and SARs agreements have provisions, which could accelerate repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest and adversely impact our liquidity.\nCredit Agreement\nWe have a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association for a $60.0 million principal amount senior secured revolving credit facility that is guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries and matures on June 1, 2022 (the Credit Agreement\u201d). See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Credit Agreement.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe contractual obligations and other commitments consisted of the following at December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\n (1) See Note 4 - Operating Leases\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (2) Forecasted principal payments are based on each participant's estimated retirement age and contractual interest rate of 3.920% on January 1, 2020 and reflect required payments that result from the retirement of certain executives. See Note 7 - Selected Balance Sheet Data\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (3) See Note 8- Notes Payable to Former Stockholders\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (4) Includes short-term and long-term deferred commissions payable. See Note 7 - Selected Balance Sheet Data\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (5) Represents current estimated payouts for participants currently receiving payments based on their elections at the time of deferral. We hold assets held in rabbi trust of $9.5 million to settle outstanding amounts when they become due. Amounts assume no increase in asset or liability due to future returns. See Note 7 - Selected Balance Sheet Data\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (6) Relates to contingent consideration in connection with our business acquisitions. See Note 6 - Acquisitions, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d and Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (7) Relates to amounts that may be advanced to sales and financing professionals and uncertain tax positions. See Note 13 - Income Taxes\u201d and Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (8) Amounts in Other represent amounts where payments are dependent on future events, which may occur at any time from less than 1 year to more than 5 years and relates to our deferred compensation liability and uncertain tax positions. Payments for deferred compensation liability are based on the participants' elections at the time of deferral. The net liability for uncertain tax positions may be payable by us in the future. The ultimate resolution depends on many factors and assumptions; accordingly, we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of such payments, if any. \nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nOur commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation. However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies; Use of Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective and our actual results may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nWe believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to (i) differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and (ii) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure existing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to have temporary differences realized or settled. We recognize in the provision for income taxes, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. We periodically evaluate the deferred tax assets to assess whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, we consider the timing of deferred tax reversals, current year taxable income and historical performance. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not\nthat some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBecause of the nature of our business, which includes activity in the U.S. and Canada, incorporating numerous states and provinces as well as local jurisdictions, our tax position can be complex. As such, our effective tax rate is subject to changes as a result of fluctuations in the mix of our activity in various jurisdictions in which we operate including changes in tax rates, state apportionment, tax related interest and penalties, valuation allowances and other permanent items. Calculating some of the amounts involves a high degree of judgment.\nWe evaluate our tax positions quarterly. The threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained by the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not\ncriterion, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized. We assess our inventory of tax positions with respect to all applicable income tax issues for all open tax years (in each respective jurisdiction) and determine whether uncertain tax positions are required to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe recognize interest and penalties incurred as income tax expense.\nLeases\nWe utilize operating leases for all our facilities and autos. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use\nassets ( ROU assets\u201d) represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our contractual obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Operating leases are included in the operating lease ROU assets, non-current,\nand operating lease liabilities, current and non-current,\ncaptions in the consolidated balance sheets.\nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease agreements may contain periods of free rent or reduced rent, predetermined fixed increases in the minimum rent and renewal or termination options, all of which add complexity and impact the determination of the lease term and lease payments to be used in calculating the lease liability. Certain facility leases provide for rental escalations related to increases in the lessors' direct operating expenses. We use the implicit rate in the lease when determinable. As most of our leases do not have a determinable implicit rate, determining the rate to be used in our calculations is judgmental. We use a derived incremental borrowing rate based on borrowing options under our credit agreement and apply a spread over treasury rates for the indicated term of the lease based on the information available on the commencement date of the lease. We typically lease general purpose built-out\noffice space, which reverts to the lessor upon termination of the lease. Any payments for completed improvements, determined to be owed by the lessor, net of incentives received, are recorded as an increase to the ROU asset and considered in the determination of the lease cost.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease\ncomponents, which are accounted for as a single lease component. Lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments consist of common area costs, insurance, taxes utilities, parking and other lease related costs, which are determined principally based on billings from landlords.\nInvestments in Marketable Securities, Available-for-Sale\nWe maintain a portfolio of investments in a variety of fixed and variable rate debt securities, including U.S. treasuries, U.S. government sponsored entities, corporate debt, asset-backed securities and other. We consider our investment in marketable securities to be available-for-sale.\nAccordingly, these investments are recorded at their fair values, with unrealized gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We determine the appropriate", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Factors Affecting Our Business\n\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur Business\nWe are a leading national brokerage firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services. We have been the top commercial real estate investment broker in the United States based on the number of investment transactions over the last 10 years. As of December 31, 2019, we had 2,021 investment sales and financing professionals that are primarily exclusive independent contractors operating in 82 offices who provide real estate brokerage and financing services to sellers and buyers of commercial real estate. We also offer market research, consulting and advisory services to our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we closed 9,726 investment sales, financing and other transactions with total sales volume of approximately $49.7 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed 9,472 sales, financing and other transactions with total sales volume of approximately $46.4 billion.\nWe generate revenues by collecting real estate brokerage commissions upon the sale, and fees upon the financing of, commercial properties and by providing consulting and advisory services. Real estate brokerage commissions are typically based upon the value of the property, and financing fees are typically based upon the size of the loan. During the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 91% of our revenues were generated from real estate brokerage commissions, 8% from financing fees and 1% from other revenues, including consulting and advisory services.\nDuring 2019, we acquired one business that was accounted for as a business combination and the results have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. This acquisition expanded our network of real estate sales professionals and provided further diversification to our real estate brokerage services.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOur business and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity are significantly affected by the number and size of commercial real estate investment sales and financing transactions that we close in any period. The number and size of these transactions are affected by our ability to recruit and retain investment sales and financing professionals, identify and contract properties for sale and identify those that need financing and refinancing. We principally monitor the commercial real estate market through four factors, which generally drive our business. The factors are the economy, commercial real estate supply and demand, capital markets and investor sentiment and investment activity.\nThe Economy\nOur business is dependent on economic conditions within the markets in which we operate. Changes in the economy on a global, national, regional or local basis can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Economic indicators and projections related to job growth, unemployment, interest rates, retail spending and confidence trends can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Overall market conditions, including global trade, interest rate changes and job creation, can affect investor sentiment and, ultimately, the demand for our services from investors in real estate.\nThe U.S. economy maintained moderate, but steady growth in the fourth quarter of 2019. It appears the low inflation, low unemployment climate has granted the Federal Reserve policy latitude, allowing them to maintain low interest rates. Steady job creation, averaging 176,000 (based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics) positions per month last year, and moderate wage growth may sustain above-average household formation and consumption levels, contributing to economic growth this year. This momentum may be partially offset by uncertainty surrounding the upcoming elections, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and concerns about the potential contagion risks of the Coronavirus.\nCommercial Real Estate Supply and Demand\nOur business is dependent on the willingness of investors to invest in or sell commercial real estate, which is affected by factors beyond our control. These factors include the supply of commercial real estate coupled with user demand for these properties and the performance of real estate assets when compared with other investment alternatives, such as stocks and bonds.\nCommercial real estate supply and demand remain in alignment, with vacancy rates generally holding steady at cycle-low\nlevels. The tight labor market and the accelerated pace of household formation continues to drive strong apartment housing demand, particularly in the workforce housing segments. Real estate sectors supported by consumption and discretionary spending remain stable, with hotel and self-storage space demand outpacing historical averages, while retail demand has balanced with the very limited construction levels. Industrial space demand, which has been more sensitive to risks sparked by the trade war and other international factors, has tapered in recent months, curtailing space absorption. In conjunction with elevated big-box\nconstruction, industrial vacancy levels have ticked up from the record-low\nlevels set last year. Office space demand remains stable as positive job creation balances with decreased square footage per employee to keep vacancy rates flat.\nCapital Markets\nCredit and liquidity issues in the financial markets have a direct impact on the flow of capital to the commercial real estate market. Real estate purchases are often financed with debt and, as a result, credit and liquidity impact transaction activity and prices. Changes in interest rates, as well as steady and protracted movements of interest rates in one direction, whether increases or decreases, could adversely or positively affect the operations and income potential of commercial real estate properties, as well as lender and equity underwriting for real estate investments. These changes influence the demand of investors for commercial real estate investments.\nMarket liquidity remains elevated despite lenders' modest tightening of underwriting standards. The broad range of capital sources, including the increased multifamily lending available through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, may sustain mainstream lending activity. Capital available for value-add\nconcepts and outlying markets appears to remain strong, but often includes secondary and mezzanine financing options. The Federal Reserve's commitment to keeping rates low, reiterated at their January 2020 meeting, has helped keep the 10-year\nTreasury in the 1.6% range, exceptionally low by historical measures. This could offer buyers increased positive leverage, which could support more aggressive bids on acquisitions, but sellers continue to price assets at a premium, keeping the bid-ask\nspread widened. Sales activity continues to fluctuate on a quarter-by-quarter\nbasis.\nInvestor Sentiment and Investment Activity\nWe rely on investors to buy and sell properties in order to generate commissions. Investors' desires to engage in real estate transactions are dependent on many factors that are beyond our control. The economy, supply and demand for properly positioned properties, available credit and market events impact investor sentiment and, therefore, transaction velocity. In addition, our private clients are often motivated to buy, sell and/or refinance properties due to personal circumstances such as death, divorce, partnership breakups and estate planning.\nLow interest rates and steady yields have continued to attract investment to real estate through direct investment as well as a multitude of REITs, equity funds and syndication options. Despite the compelling yield options and strong fundamentals across most property types, buyers remain cautious about the economic outlook and risks that may emerge during their target hold period. In many cases, investors are underwriting to a more conservative long-term outlook. Sellers, however, have been slow to reduce asking prices, and a transactional hurdle has emerged. The gap in pricing expectations is expected to remain a modest but steady headwind, extending asset marketing and closing timelines.\nSeasonality\nOur real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees have tended to be seasonal and, combined with other factors, can affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter\nbasis. Historically, this seasonality has generally caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. The concentration of earnings and cash flows in the last six months of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, is due to an industry-wide focus of clients to complete transactions towards the end of the calendar year. This historical trend can be disrupted both positively and negatively by major economic or political events impacting investor sentiment for a particular property type or location, volatility in financial markets, current and future projections of interest rates, attractiveness of other asset classes, market liquidity and the extent of limitations or availability of capital allocations for larger property buyers, among others. Private client investors may accelerate or delay transactions due to personal or business-related reasons unrelated to economic events. In addition, our operating margins are typically lower during the second half of each year due to our commission structure for some of our senior investment sales and financing professionals. These senior investment sales and financing professionals are on a graduated commission schedule that resets annually, pursuant to which higher commissions are paid for higher sales volumes. Our historical pattern of seasonality may or may not continue to the same degree experienced in prior years.\nOperating Segments\nWe follow the guidance for segment reporting, which requires reporting information on operating segments in interim and annual financial statements. Substantially all of our operations involve the delivery of commercial real estate services to our customers including real estate investment sales, financing and consulting and advisory services. Management makes operating decisions, assesses performance and allocates resources based on an ongoing review of these integrated operations, which constitute only one operating segment for financial reporting purposes.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily generated from our real estate investment sales business. In addition to real estate brokerage commissions, we generate revenues from financing fees and from other revenues, which are primarily comprised of consulting and advisory fees.\nBecause our business is transaction oriented, we rely on investment sales and financing professionals to continually develop leads, identify properties to sell, market those properties and close the sale timely to generate a consistent flow of revenue. While our sales volume is impacted by seasonality factors, the timing of closings is also dependent on many market and personal factors unique to a particular client or transaction, particularly clients transacting in the $1-$10\nmillion private client market segment. These factors can cause transactions to be accelerated or delayed beyond our control. Further, commission rates earned are generally inversely related to the value of the property sold. As a result of our expansion into the middle and larger transaction market segments, we have seen our overall commission rates fluctuate from period-to-period\nas a result of changes in the relative\nmix of the number and volume of investment sales transactions closed in the middle and larger transaction market segments as compared to the $1-$10\nmillion private client market segment. These factors may result in period-to-period\nvariations in our revenues that differ from historical patterns.\nA small percentage of our transactions include retainer fees and/or breakage fees. Retainer fees are credited against a success-based fee paid upon the closing of a transaction or a breakage fee. Transactions that are terminated before completion will sometimes generate breakage fees, which are usually calculated as a set amount or a percentage of the fee we would have received had the transaction closed.\nReal estate brokerage commissions\nWe earn real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for commercial real estate owners seeking to sell or investors seeking to buy properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions are typically recognized at the close of escrow.\nFinancing fees\nWe earn financing fees by securing financing on purchase transactions or by securing refinancing of our clients' existing mortgage debt. We recognize financing fee revenues at the time the loan closes, and we have no remaining significant obligations for performance in connection with the transaction. To a lesser extent, we also earn mortgage servicing revenue, mortgage servicing fees and ancillary fees associated with financing activities. We recognize mortgage servicing revenues upon the acquisition of a servicing obligation. We generate mortgage servicing fees through the provision of collection, remittance, recordkeeping, reporting and other related mortgage servicing functions, activities and services.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues include fees generated from consulting and advisory services performed by our investment sales professionals, as well as referral fees from other real estate brokers. Revenues from these services are recognized as they are performed and completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization. The significant components of our expenses are further described below.\nCost of services\nThe majority of our cost of services expense is variable commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities. Commission expenses are directly attributable to providing services to our clients for investment sales and financing services. Most of our investment sales and financing professionals are independent contractors and are paid commissions; however, because there are some who are initially paid a salary and certain of our financing professionals are employees, costs of services also include employee-related compensation, employer taxes and benefits for those employees. The commission rates we pay to our investment sales and financing professionals vary based on individual contracts negotiated and are generally higher for the more experienced professionals. Some of our most senior investment sales and financing professionals also have the ability to earn additional commissions after meeting certain annual revenue thresholds. These additional commissions are recognized as cost of services in the period in which they are earned. Payment of a portion of these additional commissions are generally deferred for a period of three years, at our election, and paid at the beginning of the fourth calendar year. Cost of services also includes referral fees paid to other real estate brokers where we are the principal service provider. Cost of services, therefore, can vary based on the commission structure of the independent contractors that closed transactions in any particular period.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe largest expense component within selling, general and administrative expenses is personnel expenses for our management team and sales and support staff. In addition, these costs include facilities costs (excluding depreciation and amortization), staff related expenses, sales, marketing, legal, telecommunication, network, data sources, transaction costs related to acquisitions, changes in fair value for contingent consideration and other administrative expenses. Also included in selling, general and administrative are expenses for stock-based compensation to non-employee\ndirectors, employees and independent contractors (i.e. investment sales and financing professionals) under the Amended and Restated 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan ( 2013 Plan\u201d) and the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP\u201d).\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation expense consists of depreciation recorded on our computer software and hardware and furniture, fixture and equipment. Depreciation is provided over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years for owned assets. Amortization expense consists of (i) amortization recorded on our mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs\u201d) using the interest method over the period that servicing income is expected to be received and (ii) amortization recorded on intangible assets amortized on a straight-line basis using a useful life between one and six years.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income, net gains or losses on our deferred compensation plan assets, realized gains and losses on our marketable securities, available-for-sale,\nforeign currency gains and losses and other non-operating\ngains and losses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with the stock appreciation rights ( SARs\u201d) liability, notes payable to former stockholders and our credit agreement.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. and Canadian federal taxes and individual state and local taxes based on the income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the change in the mix of our activities in the jurisdictions we operate due to differing tax rates in those jurisdictions and other permanent items. Our provision for income taxes includes the windfall tax benefits, net, from shares issued in connection with our 2013 Plan and ESPP.\nWe record deferred taxes, net based on the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time those items are expected to be recognized for tax purposes.\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The tables included in the period comparisons below provide summaries of our results of operations. The period-to-period\ncomparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. During the years\nended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we closed more than 9,700, 9,400 and 8,900 investment sales, financing and other transactions, respectively, with total sales volume of approximately $49.7 billion, $46.4 billion and $42.2 billion, respectively.

For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measure.\u201d </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nOur total revenues were $806.4 million in 2019 compared to $814.8 million in 2018, a decrease of $8.4 million, or 1.0%. Total revenues decreased as a result of decreased real estate brokerage commissions, partially offset by increases in financing fees and other revenues, as described below.\nReal estate brokerage commissions.\nRevenues from real estate brokerage commissions decreased to $729.4 million in 2019 from $747.4 million in 2018, a decrease of $18.0 million, or 2.4%. The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in the average commission rate to 1.98% in 2019 compared to 2.07% in 2018 despite the 2.2% increase in total investment sales volume in 2019 compared to 2018. The 9 basis point decrease in average commission rate was the result of the 2.7% increase in the average transaction size. Commission rates for larger investment sales are generally lower than commission rates for smaller sales.\nFinancing fees.\nRevenues from financing fees increased to $66.3 million in 2019 from $57.8 million in 2018, an increase of $8.5 million, or 14.7%. The increase was in part spurred by growth from acquisitions during 2018 and was primarily driven by a 15.1% increase in financing volume. The increase in financing volume was in part due to an increase in refinancing activity resulting from a reduction in interest rates. The average fee rate for 2019 was comparable to the average fee rate for 2018. Financing volume was primarily impacted by the 15.9% increase in the number of financing transactions as there was little change in the average transaction size.\nOther revenues.\nOther revenues increased to $10.8 million in 2019 from $9.6 million in 2018, an increase of $1.1 million or 11.8%. The increase was primarily driven by increases in consulting and advisory services during 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.\nTotal operating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $710.0 million in 2019 compared to $702.5 million in 2018, an increase of $7.5 million, or 1.1%. The increase was primarily due to increases in selling, general and administrative costs and to a lesser extent depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in costs of services, which are primarily variable commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation related costs in connection with our financing activities, as described below.\nCost of services.\nCost of services in 2019 decreased $4.0 million, or 0.8%, to $498.9 million from $502.9 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to decreased commission expenses driven by the related decreased total revenues noted above. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues slightly increased to 61.9% for 2019 compared to 61.7% for 2018 primarily due to mix in brokerage compensation.\nSelling, general and administrative expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expense in 2019 increased $9.8 million, or 5.0%, to $203.1 million from $193.3 million in 2018. Increases in our selling, general and administrative expense have been driven by our growth plans and investments in technology, sales and marketing tools and marketing and expansion of our services supporting our investment sales and financing professionals. These initiatives have primarily driven (i) a $7.2 million increase in sales operations support and promotional marketing expenses; (ii) a $3.2 million increase in facilities expenses due to expansion of offices; (iii) a $3.1 million increase in net other expense categories, primarily driven by an increase in certain licensing fees; and (iv) a $0.1 million increase in compensation related costs, primarily driven by increases in salaries and related benefits and deferred compensation obligations, partially offset by the reduction in management compensation. These increases were partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation primarily driven by the restricted stock units, which were granted in connection with our initial public offering, vesting in full in January 2019, and a $1.1 million decrease in legal costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $8.0 million in 2019 from $6.3 million in 2018, an increase of $1.7 million, or 27.3%. The increase was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets, capital expenditures due to our expansion and growth and MSRs.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net increased to $12.5 million in 2019 from $6.3 million in 2018, an increase of $6.1 million, or 97.0%. The increase was primarily driven by increases in interest income on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale,\nan increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan assets and foreign currency gains (losses).\nInterest expense\nThere were no significant changes in interest expenses in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $30.6 million for 2019 compared to $30.0 million in 2018, an increase of $0.6 million, or 2.1%. The effective tax rate for 2019 was 28.4%, compared with 25.6% in 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced windfall tax benefits recognized in 2019 compared to $1.5 million recognized in 2018 primarily as a result of no deferred stock units settling in 2019, an increase in our consolidated state tax rate and an increase in the valuation allowance with respect to our Canadian operations.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nA discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2017 can be found under Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019, which is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov\nand the Investor Relations section of our website at www.MarcusMillichap.com\n.\nNon-GAAP\nFinancial Measure\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nwe include a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, adjusted earnings before interest income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and other non-cash\nitems, or Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest income and other, including net realized gains (losses) on marketable securities, available-for-sale\nand cash and cash equivalents, (ii) interest expense, (iii) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) stock-based compensation, and (vi) non-cash\nMSR activity. We use Adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to evaluate the performance of our business, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets, among other things. We also believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate our overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. We find Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance, because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items related to capital structure, taxes and non-cash\nitems. In light of the foregoing limitations, we do not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also consider our U.S. GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 76,930\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 87,257\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 51,524\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 64,657\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 66,350\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income and other(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (10,322\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7,052\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,514\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,761\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,373\n</td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,388\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,496\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,533\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,726\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30,582\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,963\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,702\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42,445\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,297\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,363\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,387\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,305\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,278\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11,983\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,145\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,035\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,114\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash\nMSR activity(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (322\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (391\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 115,551\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 129,457\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 111,716\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 118,296\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 124,140\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Other includes net realized gains (losses) on marketable securities available-for-sale. \nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>The year ended December 31, 2017, includes a one-time\ncharge in the amount of $11.6 million in connection with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets, net due to enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% starting in 2018. In addition, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement in 2017 that required any windfall tax benefits, net of shortfalls to be recorded as a discrete item in our provision for income taxes. Prior to 2017, windfalls tax benefits, net were recorded directly to additional paid in capital. These windfalls/shortfalls arise from the difference in the grant date price and the vesting date price of employee and non-employee\ndirectors vesting of equity awards granted under our 2013 Plan. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>Non-cash\nMSR activity includes the assumption of servicing obligations. </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (4) The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is primarily due to lower total revenues and a higher proportion of operating expenses compared to total revenues. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, marketable securities, available-for-sale\nand, if necessary, borrowings under our credit agreement. In order to enhance yield to us, we have invested a portion of our cash in money market funds and in fixed and variable income debt securities, in accordance with our investment policy approved by the board of directors. Certain of our investments in money market funds may not maintain a stable net asset value and may impose fees on redemptions and/or gate fees. Although we have historically funded our operations through operating cash flows, there can be no assurance that we can continue to meet our cash requirements entirely through our operations, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale\nor availability under our credit agreement.\nCash Flows\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $18.0 million to $232.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $214.7 million at December 31, 2018. The following table sets forth our summary cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 25,287\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 117,314\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 66,537\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,422\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (117,980\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (27,338\n</td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,878\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5,437\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5,784\n</td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,987\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6,103\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33,415\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 214,683\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 220,786\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 187,371\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 232,670\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 214,683\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 220,786\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\n2019 Compared to 2018\n. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $25.3 million in 2019 compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $117.3 million in 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash\nitems and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $92.0 million decrease in operating cash flows for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in our real estate brokerage revenue and a higher proportion of operating expenses compared to total revenues, differences in timing of certain payments and receipts, an increase in advances to our investment sales and financing professionals, an increase in bonus payments in 2019 related to bonuses earned based on 2018 performance, and a reduction in the discretionary deferral of certain commissions.\nInvesting Activities\n2019 Compared to 2018\n. Cash flows used in investing activities were $3.4 million for 2019 compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $118.0 million for the same period in 2018. The $114.6 million decreased usage in cash for investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to $11.6 million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, available-for-sale\nfor 2019 compared to $94.5 million in net purchases of marketable securities, available-for-sale\nfor 2018 and an additional net $8.8 million of outflow for acquisitions in 2018 over acquisition activity in 2019. See Note 6 - Acquisitions, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFinancing Activities\n2019 Compared to 2018\n. Cash flows used in financing activities were $3.9 million for 2019 compared to $5.4 million for the same period in 2018. The change in cash flows used in financing activities for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily impacted by taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock-based awards and payments for contingent consideration in 2019 with no such comparable outflow for the same period in 2019. See Note 12 - Stock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLiquidity\nWe believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows expected to be generated from our operations, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale\nand borrowings available under the Credit Agreement (defined below) will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. If we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could prevent us from, among other factors, to fund acquisitions or to otherwise finance our growth or operations. In addition, our notes payable to former stockholders and SARs agreements have provisions, which could accelerate repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest and adversely impact our liquidity.\nCredit Agreement\nWe have a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association for a $60.0 million principal amount senior secured revolving credit facility that is guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries and matures on June 1, 2022 (the Credit Agreement\u201d). See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Credit Agreement.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe contractual obligations and other commitments consisted of the following at December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> More\nThan 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Other(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease liabilities, including imputed interest(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 89,241\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 21,262\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 33,889\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 21,317\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 12,773\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SARs liability (principal and interest)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,880\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,408\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,334\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,058\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable (principal and interest)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,897\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,897\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred commissions payable(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34,158\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,339\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,819\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred compensation liability(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,241\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,553\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,126\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,528\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent consideration(6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,788\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,238\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,163\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,142\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 245\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,146\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,235\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 911\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 171,351\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 47,604\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 63,405\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 24,827\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 30,076\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 5,439\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) See Note 4 - Operating Leases\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (2) Forecasted principal payments are based on each participant's estimated retirement age and contractual interest rate of 3.920% on January 1, 2020 and reflect required payments that result from the retirement of certain executives. See Note 7 - Selected Balance Sheet Data\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (3) See Note 8- Notes Payable to Former Stockholders\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (4) Includes short-term and long-term deferred commissions payable. See Note 7 - Selected Balance Sheet Data\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (5) Represents current estimated payouts for participants currently receiving payments based on their elections at the time of deferral. We hold assets held in rabbi trust of $9.5 million to settle outstanding amounts when they become due. Amounts assume no increase in asset or liability due to future returns. See Note 7 - Selected Balance Sheet Data\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (6) Relates to contingent consideration in connection with our business acquisitions. See Note 6 - Acquisitions, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d and Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (7) Relates to amounts that may be advanced to sales and financing professionals and uncertain tax positions. See Note 13 - Income Taxes\u201d and Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (8) Amounts in Other represent amounts where payments are dependent on future events, which may occur at any time from less than 1 year to more than 5 years and relates to our deferred compensation liability and uncertain tax positions. Payments for deferred compensation liability are based on the participants' elections at the time of deferral. The net liability for uncertain tax positions may be payable by us in the future. The ultimate resolution depends on many factors and assumptions; accordingly, we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of such payments, if any. \nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nOur commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation. However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies; Use of Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective and our actual results may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nWe believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to (i) differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and (ii) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure existing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to have temporary differences realized or settled. We recognize in the provision for income taxes, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. We periodically evaluate the deferred tax assets to assess whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, we consider the timing of deferred tax reversals, current year taxable income and historical performance. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not\nthat some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBecause of the nature of our business, which includes activity in the U.S. and Canada, incorporating numerous states and provinces as well as local jurisdictions, our tax position can be complex. As such, our effective tax rate is subject to changes as a result of fluctuations in the mix of our activity in various jurisdictions in which we operate including changes in tax rates, state apportionment, tax related interest and penalties, valuation allowances and other permanent items. Calculating some of the amounts involves a high degree of judgment.\nWe evaluate our tax positions quarterly. The threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained by the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not\ncriterion, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized. We assess our inventory of tax positions with respect to all applicable income tax issues for all open tax years (in each respective jurisdiction) and determine whether uncertain tax positions are required to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe recognize interest and penalties incurred as income tax expense.\nLeases\nWe utilize operating leases for all our facilities and autos. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use\nassets ( ROU assets\u201d) represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our contractual obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Operating leases are included in the operating lease ROU assets, non-current,\nand operating lease liabilities, current and non-current,\ncaptions in the consolidated balance sheets.\nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease agreements may contain periods of free rent or reduced rent, predetermined fixed increases in the minimum rent and renewal or termination options, all of which add complexity and impact the determination of the lease term and lease payments to be used in calculating the lease liability. Certain facility leases provide for rental escalations related to increases in the lessors' direct operating expenses. We use the implicit rate in the lease when determinable. As most of our leases do not have a determinable implicit rate, determining the rate to be used in our calculations is judgmental. We use a derived incremental borrowing rate based on borrowing options under our credit agreement and apply a spread over treasury rates for the indicated term of the lease based on the information available on the commencement date of the lease. We typically lease general purpose built-out\noffice space, which reverts to the lessor upon termination of the lease. Any payments for completed improvements, determined to be owed by the lessor, net of incentives received, are recorded as an increase to the ROU asset and considered in the determination of the lease cost.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease\ncomponents, which are accounted for as a single lease component. Lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments consist of common area costs, insurance, taxes utilities, parking and other lease related costs, which are determined principally based on billings from landlords.\nInvestments in Marketable Securities, Available-for-Sale\nWe maintain a portfolio of investments in a variety of fixed and variable rate debt securities, including U.S. treasuries, U.S. government sponsored entities, corporate debt, asset-backed securities and other. We consider our investment in marketable securities to be available-for-sale.\nAccordingly, these investments are recorded at their fair values, with unrealized gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We determine the appropriate"}
