Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nOur Business\nManning & Napier, Inc. is an independent investment management firm that provides our clients with a broad range of financial solutions and investment strategies, including wealth management services. Founded in 1970 and headquartered in Fairport, New York, we serve a diversified client base of high-net-worth individuals and institutions, including 401(k) plans, pension plans, Taft-Hartley plans, endowments and foundations.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWe are addressing the challenges of COVID-19 by protecting the health and well-being of our employees, while servicing our clients and leveraging technology to fully support our business needs in a primarily digital manner. The impact of COVID-19 on our investment performance, financial statements, capital and liquidity, and our business operations are further discussed below:\n\u2022Client Performance Impact: As a result of our ability to rapidly adapt to a remote work environment, we believe we were able to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on client performance. Additionally, due to the significant increase in volatility throughout the year, discussed in more detail in the next section, we were able to capitalize on the market environment by delivering strong results for clients in 2020.\n\u2022Financial Statement Impact: Our revenues consist primarily of investment management fees typically calculated as a percentage of the market value of our assets under management (\"AUM\"), and they are dependent on the value and composition of our AUM. As of December 31, 2020, AUM was $20.1 billion, an increase from $17.1 billion as of March 31, 2020. This 18% increase came on the heels of a market rebound primarily beginning in the second quarter, with approximately $4.9 billion of market appreciation partially offset by approximately $1.9 billion of net client outflows since March 31, 2020. Going forward, we believe the pandemic may negatively impact our operational results, cash flows, and financial position if our clients are adversely impacted by the economic results of the pandemic.\n\u2022Capital and Liquidity Impact: Our financial condition is stable, allowing us to effectively manage the financial impacts of COVID-19. We believe our capital structure should provide us with sufficient resources and flexibility to meet present and future cash needs. The Board of Directors has not approved a quarterly cash dividend on our Class A common stock since the dividend paid on May 1, 2020. Given the uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs.\n\u2022Business Operations Impact: For the health and well-being of our employees, we have modified our business practices in accordance with social distancing guidelines to encourage work-from-home arrangements, and we have restricted business-related travel. Our technology capabilities have allowed us to maintain sales and client servicing activity through digital collaboration platforms and digital marketing efforts. We believe our 2020 results, with gross client inflows comparable to prior periods and gross client outflows reduced from prior levels, indicate that our sales strategy is gaining traction. Our ability to adequately maintain our operations, internal controls and client relationships has not been adversely affected by these modifications.\nWe continue to assess the risks associated with COVID-19 and to mitigate them where possible. For further discussion regarding the potential future impacts of COVID-19 and related economic conditions on the Company's financial statements, capital and liquidity, and business operations, see \"Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors.\"\nMarket Developments\nLast year was undoubtedly volatile, but in the end, global equity performance was again strong in 2020. After one of the sharpest stock market selloffs ever, equities bounced back quickly and then sustained their gains throughout the remainder of the year. The rapid rally was led by strength in growth-style equities, which vastly outperformed their value-style counterparts for the full year, and further extended their recent multi-year run of relative outperformance. International equities delivered solid gains as well, with emerging markets somewhat outperforming international developed markets.\nIn fixed income, rates fell significantly during the first quarter and remained at historically low levels throughout the rest of the year. Falling interest rates drove strong performance, boosting bond market returns last year, but we expect low starting yields to create a challenging long-term environment going forward.\nWe believe the economic recovery is showing signs of decelerating and appears at risk of stalling out. At the same time, monetary policy remains extraordinarily accommodative, and governments appear more willing than ever to implement aggressive fiscal measures to boost growth. These and other variables are creating a highly uncertain near-term macroeconomic environment.\nConsidering that equity and fixed income valuations are both at very elevated levels, and given today's mixed economic backdrop, we expect modest returns for the near- to intermediate-term. As an active manager, we believe we are well positioned to help investors navigate a potentially choppy environment in the years ahead as they seek to meet their long-term financial goals and objectives.\nBusiness Review\nOur firm is focused on four key strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to establishing a solid foundation for future success. They are as follows: delivering excellent investment results for clients; improving sales productivity while providing exceptional client service; modernizing our technological infrastructure and increasing operational efficiency; and ensuring a talent-rich, diverse organization with a great culture. We made important progress on each of these measures throughout 2020.\nInvestment Excellence\nThe performance of our investment strategies was broadly excellent in 2020. We delivered a degree of downside protection in many of our strategies during the market volatility of the first quarter, and then substantially participated in the subsequent market recovery throughout the remainder of the year. We believe our absolute results, relative outperformance, and the performance pattern we delivered, are all indicative of the power of our time-tested research processes and disciplines.\nIn general, we believe in being patient and flexible. It is undeniable that both equity and debt valuations are elevated, but we still believe there are parts of global equity markets that remain attractive. We will continue to be opportunistic on behalf of clients as we seek to avoid areas of undue risk while capitalizing on these select areas of opportunity.\nIt is important to note that in our traditional bottom-up portfolios, in equities, we are neither dogmatic growth nor value investors. Rather, our disciplines give us very specific tools to evaluate both what we term profile\u201d stocks, which would look at home in the portfolios of growth managers, as well as what we term hurdle rate\u201d and bankable deal\u201d stocks, which have classic value characteristics. We believe this flexibility was critical to our strong results last year and remains one of our key differentiators.\nFinally, we should note that the magnitude of our outperformance in many of our strategies should be viewed as an unusual occurrence, as should the very high proportion of our strategies that outperformed. While we will always strive to deliver excellent relative results for clients, we expect to be hard-pressed to consistently repeat our near-universally excellent investment strategy results in 2020.\nSales Productivity\nOur rate of outflows decreased substantially in 2020, by approximately $2.5 billion when compared to 2019, reflecting superior investment results and excellent client service during the pandemic. The ultimate measure of improvements in our client-facing areas will be positive net flows. While we continued to sustain net outflows in 2020, it was at a much lower rate than prior years.\nWe increased our investment in our client facing teams throughout 2020. We hired five new Financial Consultants in Wealth Management, bringing our total to 19. Our new hires did not bring books of business, and we anticipate that they will ramp up in productivity over the next few years. We created team structures in multiple geographies, which has enhanced client service and increased our capacity to generate new business. Additionally, we also added a dedicated Consultant Relations Director in the fourth quarter, supporting our institutional business.\nIn February 2021, we implemented a revised pricing plan for new Wealth Management clients. New wealth management clients will be charged a bundled fee that incorporates wealth planning and advice, investment solutions, and custody. This fee is higher than our current investment-only pricing and will be additive to revenues, over time. Current clients' fees will be grandfathered and will not change. Also, institutions who use us for an asset class sleeve of a larger portfolio and not for comprehensive advice will also be exempt.\nOperational Efficiency\nOur technological overhaul was in the thick of the execution phase throughout 2020 as we pushed forward across several key initiatives simultaneously, replacing the entirety of our technology infrastructure.\nBy the end of the year, we launched the first deliverable from our implementation of InvestCloud technology to support all our distribution initiatives. That first deliverable was a new client portal that has been very well received by clients across channels. We also completed the implementation of Workday's general ledger functionality in 2020 and will be rolling out its budgeting and financial analysis module in 2021. In addition, in 2021, we will be implementing Workday applications for human resources and talent management. We made important progress in implementing Charles River's technology for trade order management, trading and portfolio compliance, and portfolio implementation in 2020. Important steps remain and completion is targeted by the end of 2021.\nThe fully integrated suite of software-as-a-service platforms that we are implementing will enable substantial operating efficiencies, better client experiences, increased targeting and discipline in sales and service, improved productivity in trade processing and portfolio implementation, and greater and more actionable business insights.\nPeople & Culture\nOur fourth strategic initiative is to ensure that we have a talent-rich, diverse and inclusive team with a powerful, distinctive culture.\nTalent density is the lifeblood of our business: it helps us analyze, manage, and optimize our investment strategies. It helps us relate, reach, and connect to more people, amplifying our strategies, solutions, and story; and it helps us innovate and remain nimble in our evolving, highly competitive industry. We want to be a destination of choice for the most capable and promising talent. Ours is largely a home-grown team, with the majority of staff entering as recent graduates, so we are focused on finding the best, developing the best, and retaining the best.\nIt is our belief that, in principle, the demographics of our firm should broadly reflect the demographics of our nation and the communities in which we do business. We are committed to getting there but acknowledge that it will take time, and we must commit to making consistent progress towards becoming a more inclusive organization.\nAs has been repeatedly demonstrated, we have no doubt that greater diversity of background, experience, and perspective, lends itself to stronger decision making, a more solid internal culture, and superior business outcomes for all stakeholders. Our corporate culture will embrace and celebrate all our differences, for they will make us a stronger, more successful, and more lasting business.\nWe believe our compensation philosophy is designed to achieve alignment between our employees' interests and those of our clients and shareholders. We have made further progress on this initiative through the increase in employee ownership in the Company, coupled with the implementation of a deferred compensation plan beginning in 2021, whereby a fraction of incentive compensation for our most highly compensated employees with be invested in our investment products and vested over a multi-year period. We believe that implementing this plan is an important step in increasing employee investment in our strategies and will provide additional short-term earnings relief during 2021.\nCorporate Structure\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, pursuant to the annual exchange process, approximately 60.0 million Class A units of Manning & Napier Group, LLC (\"Manning & Napier Group\") were tendered for cash or shares of the Company's Class A common stock. In early April 2020, the independent directors, on behalf of the Company as managing member of Manning & Napier Group, decided to settle the transaction as a redemption, utilizing approximately $90.8 million in cash. Manning & Napier Group completed the redemption on May 11, 2020, with payment made from its cash, cash equivalents and proceeds from the sale of investment securities. The Class A units were subsequently retired, and as a result, our ownership of Manning & Napier Group increased from 19.5% to 88.2% as of May 11, 2020. On February 3, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $10.0 million of Manning & Napier Inc. Class A common shares. The authority to repurchase shares will be exercised from time to time as market conditions warrant, is subject to regulatory considerations and will expire on December 31, 2021. The timing, amount, and other terms and conditions of any repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on a variety of factors, including the market price of shares, general market and economic conditions, and legal requirements.\nWe believe our full year 2020 was broadly very positive as we continue to execute on our long-term strategic plans, focusing on rebuilding the foundation of our firm in a way that positions us for sustained success.\nOur Solutions\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management fees earned from providing advisory services to separately managed accounts and to mutual funds and collective investment trusts-including those offered by Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC (\"MNA\"), the Manning & Napier Fund, Inc.(the \"Fund\"), Exeter Trust Company, and Rainier Investment Management, LLC (\"Rainier\").\nOur separate accounts are primarily distributed through our wealth management sales channel, where our financial consultants form relationships with high-net-worth individuals, endowments, foundations, and retirement plans. To a lesser extent, we also obtain a portion of our separate account distribution via third parties, either through our intermediary sales channel where national brokerage firm representatives or independent financial advisors select our separate account strategies for their clients, through our platform/sub-advisor relationships, where unaffiliated registered investment advisors approve our strategies for their product platforms, or through institutional consultants. Our separate account strategies are a primary driver of our blended asset portfolios for high-net-worth, middle market institutional clients and financial intermediaries. In contrast, larger institutions and unaffiliated registered investment advisor platforms are a driver of our separate account equity portfolios.\nOur mutual funds and collective investment trusts are primarily distributed through financial intermediaries, including brokers, financial advisors, retirement plan advisors and platform relationships. We also distribute our mutual fund and collective investment trusts through our institutional representatives, particularly within the defined contribution, Taft-Hartley,\nand institutional marketplace. Our mutual fund and collective investment trust strategies are an important driver of our blended asset class and single asset class portfolios.\nAssets Under Management\nOur sales efforts distinctly separate the Wealth Management clients to which we deliver holistic solutions, including high-net-worth families, endowments and foundations, and small and mid-sized business, from our Institutional and Intermediary clients, including third party advisors, platforms and consultants, as well as larger institutions and Taft-Hartley clients.

Assets under advisement related to our model-delivery business totaled approximately $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue earned on these services is included in other revenue within our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur wealth management channel represented 44% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2020. Blended portfolios are the most significant portion of wealth management assets, representing 87% of wealth management AUM. Equity and fixed income portfolios represent 10% and 3% respectively, of wealth management AUM.\nOur institutional and intermediary channel represented 56% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2020. Blended portfolios are also the largest portion of institutional and intermediary assets at 52% of AUM, followed by equity and fixed income portfolios at 41% and 7%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, blended portfolios account for 67% of our total AUM at $13.6 billion, an increase of $0.1 billion from blended portfolio AUM of $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019. Blended portfolio AUM is similar across both distribution channels, with 57% in wealth management and 43% in institutional and intermediary. Equity portfolios account for 28% of our total AUM, at $5.5 billion, an 11% increase from December 31, 2019, when equity portfolios were at $5.0 billion. Of equity portfolio AUM, 84% is in the institutional and intermediary channel, and 16% is in the wealth management channel. Fixed income portfolios account for 5% of total AUM at $1.0 billion, consistent with fixed income portfolio AUM at December 31, 2019. Consistent with equity portfolio AUM, the majority of fixed income assets come through the institutional and intermediary channel at 74% and 26% of fixed income AUM is in the wealth management channel.\nWe also have relationships with manager research teams at platforms in order to distribute our funds within advisory programs, or through placement on platforms' approved lists of funds. To facilitate our relationships with intermediaries, we currently have approximately 242 dealer relationships. These relationships are important to our retail business as well as our defined contribution business, including our target date collective trusts.\nOur institutional and Taft-Hartley sales team promotes our strategies to large institutional clients with which we have direct relationships, as well as to the consultants that advise them. In 2021 we added a dedicated resource to focus on institutional consultants. Additionally, we have relationships with middle-market and large market defined contribution plan sponsors seeking to use our target date collective investment trusts and Pro-Blend target risk mutual funds as default options on their investment menu. These sponsors also use our single asset class strategies as options in their defined contribution plans.\nResults of Operations\nBelow is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nOverview\nOne of the most significant factors influencing net flows and AUM is the investment performance of our various strategies. As an active manager, it is typical for our investment strategies to exhibit portfolio positioning that is notably divergent from benchmarks and common market indices. We believe this is a strength of our investment approach, although it can cause substantial performance deviations, both positive and negative, versus common benchmarks. In general, our investment processes have a preference for risk management, focusing heavily on fundamentals and valuations. Historically, we have tended to provide a degree of downside protection in adverse markets, while having participated somewhat less than fully in bull markets. Broadly speaking, we expect our investment approach to reduce volatility and create a smoother performance pattern over time, and we believe these characteristics are desirable and an attractive differentiator in our industry. As a result, the overall performance of our suite of investment strategies often differs from many others in the industry, potentially causing the results of our operations to, at times, also diverge.\nOther components impacting our operating results include:\n\u2022asset-based fee rates and changes in those rates;\n\u2022the composition of our AUM among various portfolios, sales channels and client types;\n\u2022changes in our variable costs, including incentive compensation and distribution, servicing and custody expenses, which are affected by our investment performance, level of our AUM and revenue; and\n\u2022fixed costs, including changes to base compensation, vendor-related costs and investment spending on new products.\nAssets Under Management and Investment

appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on assets under management, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends.\nRevenues\nOur revenues primarily consist of investment management fees earned from managing our clients' AUM. We earn our investment management fees as a percentage of our clients' AUM either as of a specified date or on a daily basis. Our investment management fees can fluctuate based on the average fee rate for our investment management products, which are affected by the composition of our AUM among various portfolios and investment vehicles.\nWe serve as the investment adviser for the Fund, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust. The mutual funds are open-end mutual funds designed to meet the needs of a range of institutional and other investors. The collective investment trusts are for qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans. These mutual funds and collective investment trusts comprised $5.5 billion, or 28%, of our AUM as of December 31, 2020. We also serve as the investment advisor to all of our separately managed accounts, managing $14.6 billion, or 72% of our AUM as of December 31, 2020, including assets managed as a sub-advisor to pooled investment vehicles. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our revenue earned from clients located in the United States was 98% and 99%, respectively.\nWe earn distribution and servicing fees for providing services to our affiliated mutual funds. Revenue is computed and earned daily based on a percentage of AUM.\nWe earn custodial service fees for administrative and safeguarding services performed by Exeter Trust Company, our New Hampshire-chartered trust company. Fees are calculated as a percentage of the client's market value with additional fees for certain transactions.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we completed the effort to restructure fees for many of our mutual fund and collective trust vehicles. The impacts on our overall revenue margins and operating expenses are described below in the discussion of results for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOperating Expenses\nOur largest operating expenses are employee compensation and related costs, discussed further below, with a significant portion of these expenses varying in a direct relationship to our absolute and relative investment management performance, as well as AUM and revenues. We review our operating expenses in relation to the investment market environment and changes in our revenues. However, we are generally willing to make expenditures as necessary, even when faced with declining rates of growth in revenues in order to support our investment products, our client service levels, strategic initiatives and our long-term value.\n\u2022Compensation and related costs. Employee compensation and related costs represent our largest expense, including employee salaries and benefits, incentive compensation to investment and sales professionals, compensation issued under our long-term incentive plan as well as equity compensation. These costs are affected by changes in the employee headcount, the mix of existing job descriptions, competitive factors, the addition of new skill sets and variations in the level of our AUM and revenues. These costs are also impacted by the number of awards granted under our equity plan and the amount of deferred cash awards granted under our long-term incentive plan. Incentive compensation for our research team considers the cumulative impact of both absolute and relative investment performance over historical time periods, with more weight placed on the recent periods. As such, incentive compensation paid to our research team will vary, in part, based on absolute and relative investment performance.\n\u2022Distribution, servicing and custody expenses. Distribution, servicing and custody expense represent amounts paid to various intermediaries for distribution, shareholder servicing, administrative servicing and custodial services. These expenses generally increase or decrease in line with changes in our mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM or services performed by these intermediaries. During the first quarter of 2019, we completed the effort, begun in 2017, of restructuring fees across our mutual funds. The financial impacts were a reduction in the management fees on existing business, and an offsetting reduction in related distribution, servicing and custody expenses. Given the overall pressure on fees that all active managers are facing, we believe that bringing our fund fees to a more competitive level will enhance our ability to attract additional assets in the future.\n\u2022Other operating costs. Other operating costs include accounting, legal and other professional service fees, technology, occupancy and facility costs, travel and entertainment expenses, insurance, market data service expenses and all other miscellaneous costs associated with managing the day-to-day operations of our business.\nNon-Operating Income (Loss)\nNon-operating income (loss) includes interest expense, interest and dividend income, changes in liability under the tax receivable agreement (\"TRA\") entered into between Manning & Napier and the other holders of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group, gains (losses) related to investment securities sales and changes in values of those investment securities designated as equity investments, at fair value and gain on sale of business.\nWe expect the interest and investment components of non-operating income (loss) to fluctuate based on market conditions, the performance of our investments and the overall amount of our investments held by the Company to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes and short-term investment for cash management opportunities.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company is comprised of entities that have elected to be treated as either a limited liability company (\"LLC\") or a C-Corporation.\u201d As such, the entities functioning as LLC's are not liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal or most state and local income taxes on their earnings, and their earnings (losses) will be included in the personal income tax returns of each entity's unit holders. The entities functioning as C-Corporations are liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal and state and local income taxes on their earnings and losses, respectively.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nManning & Napier, Inc. holds an economic interest of approximately 88.6% in Manning & Napier Group as of December 31, 2020, and as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning & Napier Group. As a result, the Company consolidates the financial results of Manning & Napier Group and records a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations represents the portion of earnings attributable to the economic interest in Manning & Napier Group held by the noncontrolling interests.\nAccounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and the related rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates or\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates or assumptions and may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial condition. Our management has identified the following significant accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management's judgment and estimates.\nThese policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below. Please also refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nInvestment Management: Investment management fees are computed as a percentage of AUM. Our performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time.\nSeparately managed accounts are paid in advance, typically for a semi-annual or quarterly period, or in arrears, typically for a monthly or quarterly period. When investment management fees are paid in advance, we defer the revenue as a contract liability and recognize it over the applicable period. When investment management fees are paid in arrears, we estimate revenue and record a contract asset (accrued accounts receivable) based on AUM as of the most recent month end date.\nMutual funds and collective investment trust investment management revenue is calculated and earned daily based on AUM. Revenue is presented net of cash rebates and fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds. We also have agreements with third parties who provide recordkeeping and administrative services for employee benefit plans participating in the collective investment trusts. We are acting as an agent on behalf of the employee benefit plan sponsors, therefore, investment management revenue is recorded net of fees paid to third party service providers.\nAs of January 1, 2020, we revised the presentation of investment management revenue within our consolidated statements of operations. Investment management revenue, previously presented by investment vehicle, has been disaggregated to present investment management revenue by sales channel.\nDistribution and shareholder servicing: We receive distribution and servicing fees for providing services to our affiliated mutual funds. Revenue is computed and earned daily based on a percentage of AUM. The performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. We have agreements with third parties who provide distribution and administrative services for our mutual funds. The agreements are evaluated to determine whether revenue should be reported gross or net of payments to third-party service providers. We control the services provided and act as a principal in the relationship. Therefore, distribution and shareholder servicing revenue is recorded gross of fees paid to third parties.\nCustodial services: Custodial service fees are calculated as a percentage of the client's market value with additional fees charged for certain transactions. For the safeguarding and administrative services that are subject to a percentage of market value fee, our performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. Revenue for transactions assigned a stand-alone selling price is recognized in the period which the transaction is executed. Custodial service fees are billed monthly in arrears. We have agreements with third parties who provide safeguarding, record keeping and administrative services for their clients. We control the services provided and act as a principal in the relationship. Therefore, custodial service revenue is recorded gross of fees paid to third parties.\nBecause the majority of our revenues are earned based on AUM that has been determined using fair value methods and since market appreciation/depreciation has a significant impact on our revenue, we have presented our AUM using the GAAP framework for measuring fair value. A fair value hierarchy is provided that gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following three-tier fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value:\n\u2022Level 1-observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities;\n\u2022Level 2-other significant observable inputs (including but not limited to quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment rates, credit risk, etc.); and\n\u2022Level 3-significant unobservable inputs (including our own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).\nThe table below summarizes the approximate amount of AUM for the periods indicated for which fair value is measured based on Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Level 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 AUM </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,119 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 AUM </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,480 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubstantially all our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, and we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM, as discussed in this Annual Report under Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nAll other revenue earned by us is recognized on a GAAP accounting basis as earned per the terms of the specific contract.\nConsolidation\nWe assess each legal entity in which we hold a variable interest to determine whether consolidation is appropriate at the onset of the relationship and upon certain reconsideration events. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in the entity by evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity (\"VOE\") or a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") under GAAP. Assessing whether an entity is a VOE or VIE and if it requires consolidation involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include an entity's purpose and design, a company's ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and whether a company is obligated to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. The standard also requires ongoing assessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. When utilizing the VOE model, controlling financial interest is generally defined as majority ownership of voting interests.\nWe serve as the investment adviser for the Fund, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts ( CIT\u201d) and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust, which are legal entities, the business and affairs of which are managed by their respective boards of directors. As a result, each of these entities is a VOE. We hold, in limited cases, direct investments in a fund (which are made on the same terms as are available to other investors) and consolidate each of these entities where it has a controlling financial interest or a majority voting interest.\nWe make initial seed investments in sponsored investment portfolios to develop new products and services for our clients. The original seed investment may be held in a separately managed account, comprised solely of our investments, or within a mutual fund, where our investment may represent all or only a portion of the total equity invested in the mutual fund. We evaluate our seed investments on a regular basis and consolidate such mutual funds for which we hold a controlling financial interest. When we no longer hold a financial controlling interest, we deconsolidate the fund and classify the remaining investment as either an equity method investment or as equity investments, at fair value, as applicable.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Manning & Napier holds an economic interest of approximately 88.6% in Manning & Napier Group, and as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning & Napier Group. As a result, we consolidate the financial results of Manning & Napier Group and record a noncontrolling interest on our consolidated statements of financial condition with respect to the remaining economic interest in Manning & Napier Group held by M&N Group Holdings and Manning & Napier Capital Company, LLC (\"MNCC\").\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. We attribute all goodwill associated with past acquisitions to our single reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit associated with the goodwill to the reporting unit's recorded value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its recorded value an impairment loss will be recorded.\nThe annual test of goodwill indicated that there were no facts or circumstances occurring in 2020 suggesting possible impairment. The impairment tests included certain underlying key assumptions regarding future overall market trends and our operating performance. If actual future market results and our operating performance vary unfavorably to those included in our financial forecast, we may be subject to impairment charges related to its goodwill.\nIncome Tax Provision\nManagement judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance that might be required against deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020, we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. In the event that sufficient taxable income does not result in future years, among other things, a valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets may be required. Because\nthe determination of our annual income tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that the actual results will vary from those recorded in our financial statements. Hence, we recognize additions to and reductions in income tax expense during a reporting period that pertains to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and our actual tax returns and tax audits are completed.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized.\nPayments Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nAs a result of Manning & Napier's purchase of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group or exchange for Class A common stock of Manning & Napier for Class A units of Manning & Napier Group and Manning & Napier Group's election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code, we expect to benefit from depreciation and amortization deductions from an increase in tax basis of tangible and intangible assets of Manning & Napier Group. Those deductions allocated to us will be taken into account in reporting our taxable income.\nIn connection with our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), the TRA was entered into between Manning & Napier and the holders of Manning & Napier Group, pursuant to which Manning & Napier is required to pay to such holders 85% of the applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax that Manning & Napier actually realizes, or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances, as a result of (i) certain tax attributes of their units sold to Manning & Napier or exchanged (for shares of Class A common stock) and that are created as a result of the sales or exchanges and payments under the TRA and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest.\nAt December 31, 2020, we have recorded a total liability of $19.0 million, representing the payments due to the selling unit holders under the TRA. Payments are anticipated to be made annually commencing from the date of each event that gives rise to the TRA benefits. The actual amount and timing of any payments may vary from this estimate due to a number of factors, including a material change in the relevant tax law or our failure to earn sufficient taxable income to realize all estimated tax benefits. The expected payment obligation assumes no additional uncertain tax positions that would impact the TRAs.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,

assets between portfolios are included in gross client inflows and gross client outflows.\n(2)Market appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on AUM, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends.\n(3)AUM and gross client flows between sales channels have been estimated based upon preliminary data. For a limited portion of our mutual fund AUM, reporting by sales channel is not available at the time of this report. Such estimates have no impact on total AUM, total cash flows, or AUM by investment portfolio reported in the table above.\nThe total AUM increase of $0.6 billion, or 3%, to $20.1 billion at December 31, 2020 from $19.5 billion at December 31, 2019 was attributable to $3.0 billion of market appreciation, partially offset by net client outflows of $2.3 billion and other changes. Net client outflows consisted of approximately $0.5 billion of net outflows from the wealth management channel and $1.8 billion from the institutional and intermediary channel. By portfolio, the rates of change in AUM from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 consisted of a $0.6 billion, or 11% increase in our equity portfolio, and a less than $0.1 billion, or 1% increase in our blended asset portfolio.\nWhile many of our key strategies achieved strong relative returns in 2020, which made our three- and five-year relative returns competitive, we attribute our 2020 net cash outflows to the lags with which improved investment results translate into new business. We believe that our ability to improve cash flows going forward will depend on our ability to sustain the improved investment performance we achieved over the past year and execute on our strategic initiatives focused on gathering and retaining client assets.\nThe composition of our AUM was 44% in wealth management and 56% in institutional and intermediary as of December 31, 2020, a shift from 45% in wealth management and 55% in institutional and intermediary at December 31, 2019. The composition of our AUM across portfolios at December 31, 2020 was 67% in blended assets, 28% in equity, and 5% in fixed income, compared to 69% in blended assets, 26% in equity, and 5% in fixed income at December 31, 2019.\nWith regard to our wealth management channel, gross client inflows of $0.9 billion were offset by approximately $1.5 billion of gross client outflows during the year ended December 31, 2020. The $0.9 billion of gross client inflows included $0.7 billion into our blended asset portfolios, $0.1 billion into our equity portfolios and $0.1 billion into fixed income. Our blended asset and equity portfolios experienced gross client outflows of approximately $1.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, with the remainder in outflows coming from fixed income.\nNet client outflows of $1.8 billion from our institutional and intermediary channel included gross client inflows of $1.5 billion offset by gross client outflows of $3.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross client inflows into our blended asset portfolios, represented $0.9 billion, or 58% and equity portfolios had $0.5 billion or 36%, of institutional and intermediary gross client inflows during the year ended December 31, 2020. With regard to gross client outflows, $2.4 billion, or 75%, of institutional and intermediary gross client outflows were from blended asset institutional and intermediary products.\nThe following

Condition and Results of Operations - Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for Manning & Napier's reasons for including these non-GAAP measures in this report and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures for the periods indicated.\nRevenues\nWealth Management revenue decreased by $0.2 million, or less than 1%, to $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $56.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is driven primarily by a 5%, or $0.4 billion decrease in our average wealth management AUM for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the concentration of investments in our wealth management channel assets was 87% blended assets, 10% equity and 3% fixed income, compared to 82% blended assets, 15% equity and 3% fixed income as of December 31, 2019.\nInstitutional and intermediary revenue decreased by $6.9 million, or 12%, to $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was driven primarily by a 9%, or $1.1 billion, decrease in our average institutional and intermediary AUM for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the concentration of investments in our institutional and intermediary channel was 52% blended assets, 41% equity and 7% fixed income, compared to 59% blended assets, 34% equity and 7% fixed income as of December 31, 2019.\nDistribution and shareholder servicing revenue decreased by $1.0 million, or 9%, to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was driven primarily by the reduction in mutual fund and collective trust average AUM of 11% for the same period.\nCustodial services revenue decreased by $0.6 million, or 9%, to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease primarily relates to decreases in our collective investment trust AUM.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses decreased by $20.1 million, or 15%, to $113.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $133.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCompensation and related costs decreased by $6.6 million, or 8%, to $74.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily driven by a decrease in our workforce, coupled with a reduction in employee severance costs and sales incentives. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation for our investment team resulting from investment performance. As a percentage of revenue, compensation and related costs for 2020 were 59%, compared to 60% in 2019.\nDistribution, servicing and custody expenses decreased by $2.3 million, or 19%, to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in expense was driven by an 11% decrease in mutual funds and collective investment trusts average AUM during the year ended December 31, 2020 as well as the completion of the Advisor's mutual fund fee restructure during the first quarter of 2019, where a portion of these expenses are now borne by the mutual funds directly. As a percentage of mutual fund and collective investment trust average AUM, distribution, servicing and custody expense was 0.19% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 0.20% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther operating costs decreased by $11.2 million, or 28%, to $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $39.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an overall reduction in operational costs resulting from COVID-19 including a decrease in travel and facility costs, which we do not expect to remain at lower levels once the prevalence of COVID-19 has diminished. Also affecting this decrease as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was the impact of $6.3 million of expenses recognized during the fourth quarter of 2019 related to our technology upgrade initiatives and the recognition of a $1.2 million gain during 2020, which offset other operating costs, related to the reimbursement of prior expenses paid on behalf of our affiliated mutual funds and collective investment trusts (\"the Funds and CITs\") upon the settlement of the Funds and CITs claim against a third party. As a percentage of revenue, other operating costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 23% and 29%, respectively.\nNon-Operating Income (Loss)\nNon-operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was less than $0.1 million, a decrease of $7.6 million, from non-operating income of $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table reflects the components of non-operating income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(58) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and dividend income (1)\n</td> <td>934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,328) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(71) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in liability under tax receivable agreement (2)\n</td> <td>(1,803) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(199) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,604) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>806 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains (losses) on investments (3)\n</td> <td>888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(789) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of business (4)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,883) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-operating income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,589) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________\n(1)The decrease in interest and dividend income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 is attributable to a decrease in investments, including U.S. Treasury notes and bills, corporate bonds and other short-term investments to optimize cash management opportunities, coupled with a decrease in interest rates.\n(2)The change in the liability under the TRA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 is driven by an increase in the Company's expected tax benefits under the TRA with the other holders of units of Manning & Napier Group and the corresponding changes in the payment of such benefits. The change during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 is driven by the tax benefits realized with the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") on March 27, 2020.\n(3)The amount of net gain on investments held by us, to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes and to hedge economic exposure to market movements on our deferred compensation plan, will vary depending on the performance and overall amount of our investments.\n(4)The gain on sale of business during the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to the completion of the sale of Perspective Partners, LLC on August 30, 2019.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nThe provision for (benefit from) income taxes decreased by approximately $0.6 million, to a benefit of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from a provision of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change is attributed to the enactment of the CARES Act which includes, among other things, the elimination of certain restrictions on net operating losses. As a result, we recognized an income tax benefit related to the favorable rate applied to our net operating losses. This decrease is partially offset by a higher portion of Manning & Napier Group's earnings subject to taxation at the C-Corporation level. Manning & Napier Inc.'s ownership of Manning & Napier Group increased as a result of the redemption and subsequent retirement of 60,012,419 Class A units of Manning & Napier Group on May 11, 2020.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information\nTo provide investors with greater insight into operating results, promote transparency, facilitate comparison of period-to-period results, and to allow a more comprehensive understanding of information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, we supplement our consolidated statements of operations presented on a GAAP basis with non-GAAP financial measures of earnings.\nBeginning with the release of our operating results for the third quarter of 2019, as supplemental information we began providing a new non-GAAP measure, economic income. Management uses economic income, economic net income and economic net income per adjusted share as financial measures to evaluate the profitability and efficiency of our business as a whole in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Economic income, economic net income and economic net income per adjusted share are not presented in accordance with GAAP.\nEconomic income, for periods beginning in and subsequent to January 1, 2019, presents a financial measure of the controlling and non-controlling interests of Manning & Napier Group and excludes from income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net. We define strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net, as items related to our ongoing strategic review focused on the evolution of our distribution strategy and technology initiatives.\nThese include severance-related costs, certain consulting and other professional service fees, lease and other contract termination costs, and gain or loss on sale of a business.\nEconomic net income is a non-GAAP measure of after-tax operating performance for the controlling and non-controlling interests of Manning & Napier Group and equals the Company's income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes less adjusted income taxes. Adjusted income taxes are estimated assuming the exchange of all outstanding units of Manning & Napier Group into Class A common stock on a one-to-one basis. Therefore, all income of Manning & Napier Group allocated to the units of Manning & Napier Group is treated as if it were allocated to Manning & Napier and represents an estimate of income tax expense at an effective rate of 13.3% and 29.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, reflecting assumed federal, state and local income taxes.\nEconomic net income per adjusted share is equal to economic net income divided by the total number of adjusted Class A common shares outstanding. The number of adjusted Class A common shares outstanding for all periods presented is determined by assuming the weighted average exchangeable units of Manning & Napier Group, weighted average unvested restricted stock unit, weighted average unvested restricted stock awards and weighted average vested stock options are converted into the Company's outstanding Class A common stock as of the respective reporting date, on a one-to-one basis. The Company's management uses economic net income, among other financial data, to determine the earnings available to distribute as dividends to holders of its Class A common stock and to the holders of the units of Manning & Napier Group.\nInvestors should consider the non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our other financial and operating data:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except share data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic income (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,529 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic net income (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic net income per adjusted share (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average adjusted Class A common stock outstanding (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>43,376,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,392,456 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except share data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Manning & Napier, Inc.\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,433 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>3,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,424 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: Provision for (benefit from) income taxes </td> <td>(106) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>448 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes </td> <td>13,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,305 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: strategic restructuring and transaction costs, net (1)\n</td> <td>2,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,224 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic income (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>16,659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,529 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted income taxes (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>2,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,373 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic net income (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding -

Our current financial condition is highly liquid, with a significant amount of our assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and investment securities held by us for the purposes of optimizing short-term cash management and providing initial cash seeding for product development purposes.\nThe following table sets forth certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,088 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,182 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,467 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts payable under tax receivable agreement (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,521 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________\n(1)In light of numerous factors affecting our obligation to make such payments, the timing and amounts of any such actual payments are based on our best estimate as of the end of each period presented, including the ability to realize the expected tax benefits. Actual payments may significantly differ from estimated payments. See Accounting Policies - Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for more information.\nWe have no material assets other than our ownership of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group and, accordingly, will depend on distributions from Manning & Napier Group to pay taxes, operating expenses, as well as any dividends we may pay. As managing member of Manning & Napier Group, we will determine the timing and amount of any distributions paid to its members. We intend to cause Manning & Napier Group to distribute cash to its members, including us, in an amount sufficient to cover taxes and operating expenses, including dividends, if any, declared by us. If we do cause Manning & Napier Group to make such distributions, M&N Group Holdings, MNCC and any other holders of units of Manning & Napier Group will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions on a pari passu basis. Due to the market volatility and resulting earnings volatility stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board of Directors did not approve any cash dividends on our Class A common stock since the dividend paid on May 1, 2020. The historical quarterly cash dividends on our Class A common stock were, and we believe any future dividends would be, funded from our portion of distributions made by Manning & Napier Group, from its available cash generated from operations. Our management team and the Board of Directors will continue to monitor our ability to pay future dividends on a quarterly basis.\nIn determining the sufficiency of liquidity and capital resources to fund our business, we regularly monitor our liquidity position, including among other things, cash, working capital, long-term liabilities, lease commitments and operating company distributions.\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act which includes, among other things, the ability to carryback net operating losses from 2018, 2019 and 2020 to prior years. We expect to carryback net operating losses generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to prior years and claim refunds when the federal corporate tax rate was 34% compared to the current statutory rate of 21%. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $1.9 million, related to the favorable rate applied to our net operating losses. As a result, we increased the amounts payable under the TRA, representing 85% of the applicable cash savings. As of December 31, 2020, we have recorded an estimated income tax refund of approximately $4.5 million within our prepaid expenses and other assets, of which we expect to pay out 85% under our TRA. At this time, we do not anticipate the enactment of the CARES Act to have any other material impacts to our short- and long-term liquidity.\nA state is currently auditing the Company's 2016, 2017 and 2018 corporate tax returns. The audit is expected to be completed in 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the audit is in process and the state is collecting and evaluating the data for which the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. We believe any potential increases to this liability, which could be up to approximately $1.3 million, would not result in a material change to our financial position.\nAs of December 31, 2020, a total of 2,021,781 units of Manning & Napier Group were held by the noncontrolling interests, including M&N Group Holdings and MNCC. Pursuant to the terms of the annual exchange process, such units may be tendered for exchange or redemption. On March 15, 2020, certain legacy shareholders and William Manning, the former Chairman of our Board of Directors, tendered a total of 60,012,419 Class A units, including 59,957,419 units held by William Manning, for cash or shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the annual exchange process.\nThe independent directors, on behalf of the Company, decided to settle the transaction utilizing approximately $90.8 million in cash, including approximately $90.7 million paid to Mr. Manning. Manning & Napier Group completed the redemption on May 11, 2020, with payment made from its cash, cash equivalents and proceeds from the sale of investment securities. Subsequent to the redemption, the Class A units were retired and as a result, Manning & Napier's ownership of Manning & Napier Group increased from 19.5% to 88.2% as of May 11, 2020.\nThe Company is nearing the completion of the 2021 exchange period whereby eligible Class A units of Manning & Napier Group held by M&N Group Holdings and MNCC may be tendered for exchange or redemption. In connection with the exchange, the Company has the ability to pay an amount of cash equal to the number of units tendered multiplied by the value of one share of the Company's Class A common stock less a market discount and expected expenses, or at the Company's election issue shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.\nFollowing the settlement of the redemption of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group on May 11, 2020, we have significantly less cash and cash equivalents to meet working capital requirements and liquidity needs. With approximately $81.1 million in cash and investment securities on hand as of December 31, 2020, we expect that we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We believe cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient over the next twelve months to meet our working capital requirements.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Operating activities consist primarily of net income subject to adjustments for changes in operating assets and liabilities, equity-based compensation expense, changes in the liability under the TRA, deferred income taxes, gain on sale of business in 2019 and of intangible assets, and depreciation and amortization. Investing activities consist primarily of the purchase and sale of investments for the purpose of providing initial cash seeding for product development purposes and cash management purposes, gain on sale of intangible assets, gain on sale of business in 2019 and purchases of property and equipment. Financing activities consist primarily of distributions to noncontrolling interests, dividends paid on our Class A common stock, payment of shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding requirements related to equity awards and purchases of Class A units held by the noncontrolling interests of Manning & Napier Group.\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,965 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by investing activities </td> <td>67,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities </td> <td>(94,423) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,640) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash flows </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,453) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,502 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities provided $17.6 million and $15.0 million of net cash for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This overall $2.6 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was due to an increase in net income after adjustment for non-cash items of approximately $7.7 million, which was driven by an increase in operating income resulting primarily from lower operating expenses. This was partially offset by an overall decrease of approximately $5.1 million from operating assets and liabilities, primarily from increased technology implementation costs during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities provided $67.4 million and $3.2 million of net cash for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This change was driven by an increase in cash from investing activities of $65.0 million due to our funding of and timing of activity within our investment securities in order to facilitate the redemption of Class A units during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we received approximately $64.0 million, net, from the purchase and sale of certain securities for cash management purposes compared to $3.0 million in the same period of 2019. Also during the year ended December 31, 2019, we received proceeds from the sale of intangible assets and businesses of approximately $3.1 million. Our purchases of property and equipment were approximately $0.2 million and $2.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities used $94.4 million and $10.6 million of net cash for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This overall $83.8 million increase in net cash used in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily the result of an increase in cash used for the redemption of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group pursuant to the annual exchange process, existing since the time of our IPO, of $90.8 million in 2020 compared to $3.1 million in 2019. This increase of $87.7 million in 2020 compared to the prior year was due to a significantly higher number of units redeemed in 2020. In addition, we used approximately $2.1 million for the payment of shares withheld to satisfy withholding requirements on vested equity awards and exercise of stock options during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $0.4 million in 2019. This increase in cash used from financing activities was partially offset by a reduction in distributions to noncontrolling interests of $5.1 million due to Manning & Napier, Inc.'s increased ownership of Manning & Napier Group resulting from the redemption and subsequent retirement of 60,012,419 Class A units of Manning & Napier Group on May 11, 2020 as well as a reduction in dividends paid on Class A common stock to $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.2 million in 2019.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet

</td>", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nOur Business\nManning & Napier, Inc. is an independent investment management firm that provides our clients with a broad range of financial solutions and investment strategies, including wealth management services. Founded in 1970 and headquartered in Fairport, New York, we serve a diversified client base of high-net-worth individuals and institutions, including 401(k) plans, pension plans, Taft-Hartley plans, endowments and foundations.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWe are addressing the challenges of COVID-19 by protecting the health and well-being of our employees, while servicing our clients and leveraging technology to fully support our business needs in a primarily digital manner. The impact of COVID-19 on our investment performance, financial statements, capital and liquidity, and our business operations are further discussed below:\n\u2022Client Performance Impact: As a result of our ability to rapidly adapt to a remote work environment, we believe we were able to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on client performance. Additionally, due to the significant increase in volatility throughout the year, discussed in more detail in the next section, we were able to capitalize on the market environment by delivering strong results for clients in 2020.\n\u2022Financial Statement Impact: Our revenues consist primarily of investment management fees typically calculated as a percentage of the market value of our assets under management (\"AUM\"), and they are dependent on the value and composition of our AUM. As of December 31, 2020, AUM was $20.1 billion, an increase from $17.1 billion as of March 31, 2020. This 18% increase came on the heels of a market rebound primarily beginning in the second quarter, with approximately $4.9 billion of market appreciation partially offset by approximately $1.9 billion of net client outflows since March 31, 2020. Going forward, we believe the pandemic may negatively impact our operational results, cash flows, and financial position if our clients are adversely impacted by the economic results of the pandemic.\n\u2022Capital and Liquidity Impact: Our financial condition is stable, allowing us to effectively manage the financial impacts of COVID-19. We believe our capital structure should provide us with sufficient resources and flexibility to meet present and future cash needs. The Board of Directors has not approved a quarterly cash dividend on our Class A common stock since the dividend paid on May 1, 2020. Given the uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs.\n\u2022Business Operations Impact: For the health and well-being of our employees, we have modified our business practices in accordance with social distancing guidelines to encourage work-from-home arrangements, and we have restricted business-related travel. Our technology capabilities have allowed us to maintain sales and client servicing activity through digital collaboration platforms and digital marketing efforts. We believe our 2020 results, with gross client inflows comparable to prior periods and gross client outflows reduced from prior levels, indicate that our sales strategy is gaining traction. Our ability to adequately maintain our operations, internal controls and client relationships has not been adversely affected by these modifications.\nWe continue to assess the risks associated with COVID-19 and to mitigate them where possible. For further discussion regarding the potential future impacts of COVID-19 and related economic conditions on the Company's financial statements, capital and liquidity, and business operations, see \"Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors.\"\nMarket Developments\nLast year was undoubtedly volatile, but in the end, global equity performance was again strong in 2020. After one of the sharpest stock market selloffs ever, equities bounced back quickly and then sustained their gains throughout the remainder of the year. The rapid rally was led by strength in growth-style equities, which vastly outperformed their value-style counterparts for the full year, and further extended their recent multi-year run of relative outperformance. International equities delivered solid gains as well, with emerging markets somewhat outperforming international developed markets.\nIn fixed income, rates fell significantly during the first quarter and remained at historically low levels throughout the rest of the year. Falling interest rates drove strong performance, boosting bond market returns last year, but we expect low starting yields to create a challenging long-term environment going forward.\nWe believe the economic recovery is showing signs of decelerating and appears at risk of stalling out. At the same time, monetary policy remains extraordinarily accommodative, and governments appear more willing than ever to implement aggressive fiscal measures to boost growth. These and other variables are creating a highly uncertain near-term macroeconomic environment.\nConsidering that equity and fixed income valuations are both at very elevated levels, and given today's mixed economic backdrop, we expect modest returns for the near- to intermediate-term. As an active manager, we believe we are well positioned to help investors navigate a potentially choppy environment in the years ahead as they seek to meet their long-term financial goals and objectives.\nBusiness Review\nOur firm is focused on four key strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to establishing a solid foundation for future success. They are as follows: delivering excellent investment results for clients; improving sales productivity while providing exceptional client service; modernizing our technological infrastructure and increasing operational efficiency; and ensuring a talent-rich, diverse organization with a great culture. We made important progress on each of these measures throughout 2020.\nInvestment Excellence\nThe performance of our investment strategies was broadly excellent in 2020. We delivered a degree of downside protection in many of our strategies during the market volatility of the first quarter, and then substantially participated in the subsequent market recovery throughout the remainder of the year. We believe our absolute results, relative outperformance, and the performance pattern we delivered, are all indicative of the power of our time-tested research processes and disciplines.\nIn general, we believe in being patient and flexible. It is undeniable that both equity and debt valuations are elevated, but we still believe there are parts of global equity markets that remain attractive. We will continue to be opportunistic on behalf of clients as we seek to avoid areas of undue risk while capitalizing on these select areas of opportunity.\nIt is important to note that in our traditional bottom-up portfolios, in equities, we are neither dogmatic growth nor value investors. Rather, our disciplines give us very specific tools to evaluate both what we term profile\u201d stocks, which would look at home in the portfolios of growth managers, as well as what we term hurdle rate\u201d and bankable deal\u201d stocks, which have classic value characteristics. We believe this flexibility was critical to our strong results last year and remains one of our key differentiators.\nFinally, we should note that the magnitude of our outperformance in many of our strategies should be viewed as an unusual occurrence, as should the very high proportion of our strategies that outperformed. While we will always strive to deliver excellent relative results for clients, we expect to be hard-pressed to consistently repeat our near-universally excellent investment strategy results in 2020.\nSales Productivity\nOur rate of outflows decreased substantially in 2020, by approximately $2.5 billion when compared to 2019, reflecting superior investment results and excellent client service during the pandemic. The ultimate measure of improvements in our client-facing areas will be positive net flows. While we continued to sustain net outflows in 2020, it was at a much lower rate than prior years.\nWe increased our investment in our client facing teams throughout 2020. We hired five new Financial Consultants in Wealth Management, bringing our total to 19. Our new hires did not bring books of business, and we anticipate that they will ramp up in productivity over the next few years. We created team structures in multiple geographies, which has enhanced client service and increased our capacity to generate new business. Additionally, we also added a dedicated Consultant Relations Director in the fourth quarter, supporting our institutional business.\nIn February 2021, we implemented a revised pricing plan for new Wealth Management clients. New wealth management clients will be charged a bundled fee that incorporates wealth planning and advice, investment solutions, and custody. This fee is higher than our current investment-only pricing and will be additive to revenues, over time. Current clients' fees will be grandfathered and will not change. Also, institutions who use us for an asset class sleeve of a larger portfolio and not for comprehensive advice will also be exempt.\nOperational Efficiency\nOur technological overhaul was in the thick of the execution phase throughout 2020 as we pushed forward across several key initiatives simultaneously, replacing the entirety of our technology infrastructure.\nBy the end of the year, we launched the first deliverable from our implementation of InvestCloud technology to support all our distribution initiatives. That first deliverable was a new client portal that has been very well received by clients across channels. We also completed the implementation of Workday's general ledger functionality in 2020 and will be rolling out its budgeting and financial analysis module in 2021. In addition, in 2021, we will be implementing Workday applications for human resources and talent management. We made important progress in implementing Charles River's technology for trade order management, trading and portfolio compliance, and portfolio implementation in 2020. Important steps remain and completion is targeted by the end of 2021.\nThe fully integrated suite of software-as-a-service platforms that we are implementing will enable substantial operating efficiencies, better client experiences, increased targeting and discipline in sales and service, improved productivity in trade processing and portfolio implementation, and greater and more actionable business insights.\nPeople & Culture\nOur fourth strategic initiative is to ensure that we have a talent-rich, diverse and inclusive team with a powerful, distinctive culture.\nTalent density is the lifeblood of our business: it helps us analyze, manage, and optimize our investment strategies. It helps us relate, reach, and connect to more people, amplifying our strategies, solutions, and story; and it helps us innovate and remain nimble in our evolving, highly competitive industry. We want to be a destination of choice for the most capable and promising talent. Ours is largely a home-grown team, with the majority of staff entering as recent graduates, so we are focused on finding the best, developing the best, and retaining the best.\nIt is our belief that, in principle, the demographics of our firm should broadly reflect the demographics of our nation and the communities in which we do business. We are committed to getting there but acknowledge that it will take time, and we must commit to making consistent progress towards becoming a more inclusive organization.\nAs has been repeatedly demonstrated, we have no doubt that greater diversity of background, experience, and perspective, lends itself to stronger decision making, a more solid internal culture, and superior business outcomes for all stakeholders. Our corporate culture will embrace and celebrate all our differences, for they will make us a stronger, more successful, and more lasting business.\nWe believe our compensation philosophy is designed to achieve alignment between our employees' interests and those of our clients and shareholders. We have made further progress on this initiative through the increase in employee ownership in the Company, coupled with the implementation of a deferred compensation plan beginning in 2021, whereby a fraction of incentive compensation for our most highly compensated employees with be invested in our investment products and vested over a multi-year period. We believe that implementing this plan is an important step in increasing employee investment in our strategies and will provide additional short-term earnings relief during 2021.\nCorporate Structure\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, pursuant to the annual exchange process, approximately 60.0 million Class A units of Manning & Napier Group, LLC (\"Manning & Napier Group\") were tendered for cash or shares of the Company's Class A common stock. In early April 2020, the independent directors, on behalf of the Company as managing member of Manning & Napier Group, decided to settle the transaction as a redemption, utilizing approximately $90.8 million in cash. Manning & Napier Group completed the redemption on May 11, 2020, with payment made from its cash, cash equivalents and proceeds from the sale of investment securities. The Class A units were subsequently retired, and as a result, our ownership of Manning & Napier Group increased from 19.5% to 88.2% as of May 11, 2020. On February 3, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $10.0 million of Manning & Napier Inc. Class A common shares. The authority to repurchase shares will be exercised from time to time as market conditions warrant, is subject to regulatory considerations and will expire on December 31, 2021. The timing, amount, and other terms and conditions of any repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on a variety of factors, including the market price of shares, general market and economic conditions, and legal requirements.\nWe believe our full year 2020 was broadly very positive as we continue to execute on our long-term strategic plans, focusing on rebuilding the foundation of our firm in a way that positions us for sustained success.\nOur Solutions\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management fees earned from providing advisory services to separately managed accounts and to mutual funds and collective investment trusts-including those offered by Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC (\"MNA\"), the Manning & Napier Fund, Inc.(the \"Fund\"), Exeter Trust Company, and Rainier Investment Management, LLC (\"Rainier\").\nOur separate accounts are primarily distributed through our wealth management sales channel, where our financial consultants form relationships with high-net-worth individuals, endowments, foundations, and retirement plans. To a lesser extent, we also obtain a portion of our separate account distribution via third parties, either through our intermediary sales channel where national brokerage firm representatives or independent financial advisors select our separate account strategies for their clients, through our platform/sub-advisor relationships, where unaffiliated registered investment advisors approve our strategies for their product platforms, or through institutional consultants. Our separate account strategies are a primary driver of our blended asset portfolios for high-net-worth, middle market institutional clients and financial intermediaries. In contrast, larger institutions and unaffiliated registered investment advisor platforms are a driver of our separate account equity portfolios.\nOur mutual funds and collective investment trusts are primarily distributed through financial intermediaries, including brokers, financial advisors, retirement plan advisors and platform relationships. We also distribute our mutual fund and collective investment trusts through our institutional representatives, particularly within the defined contribution, Taft-Hartley,\nand institutional marketplace. Our mutual fund and collective investment trust strategies are an important driver of our blended asset class and single asset class portfolios.\nAssets Under Management\nOur sales efforts distinctly separate the Wealth Management clients to which we deliver holistic solutions, including high-net-worth families, endowments and foundations, and small and mid-sized business, from our Institutional and Intermediary clients, including third party advisors, platforms and consultants, as well as larger institutions and Taft-Hartley clients. The table below reflects the estimated composition of our assets under management as of December 31, 2020, by sales channel and investment portfolio:\n\nExcluded from assets under management are non-discretionary assets associated with our model-delivery business, where certain of our investment strategies are provided to sponsor platforms for implementation into client portfolios. Assets under advisement related to our model-delivery business totaled approximately $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue earned on these services is included in other revenue within our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur wealth management channel represented 44% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2020. Blended portfolios are the most significant portion of wealth management assets, representing 87% of wealth management AUM. Equity and fixed income portfolios represent 10% and 3% respectively, of wealth management AUM.\nOur institutional and intermediary channel represented 56% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2020. Blended portfolios are also the largest portion of institutional and intermediary assets at 52% of AUM, followed by equity and fixed income portfolios at 41% and 7%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, blended portfolios account for 67% of our total AUM at $13.6 billion, an increase of $0.1 billion from blended portfolio AUM of $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019. Blended portfolio AUM is similar across both distribution channels, with 57% in wealth management and 43% in institutional and intermediary. Equity portfolios account for 28% of our total AUM, at $5.5 billion, an 11% increase from December 31, 2019, when equity portfolios were at $5.0 billion. Of equity portfolio AUM, 84% is in the institutional and intermediary channel, and 16% is in the wealth management channel. Fixed income portfolios account for 5% of total AUM at $1.0 billion, consistent with fixed income portfolio AUM at December 31, 2019. Consistent with equity portfolio AUM, the majority of fixed income assets come through the institutional and intermediary channel at 74% and 26% of fixed income AUM is in the wealth management channel.\nWe also have relationships with manager research teams at platforms in order to distribute our funds within advisory programs, or through placement on platforms' approved lists of funds. To facilitate our relationships with intermediaries, we currently have approximately 242 dealer relationships. These relationships are important to our retail business as well as our defined contribution business, including our target date collective trusts.\nOur institutional and Taft-Hartley sales team promotes our strategies to large institutional clients with which we have direct relationships, as well as to the consultants that advise them. In 2021 we added a dedicated resource to focus on institutional consultants. Additionally, we have relationships with middle-market and large market defined contribution plan sponsors seeking to use our target date collective investment trusts and Pro-Blend target risk mutual funds as default options on their investment menu. These sponsors also use our single asset class strategies as options in their defined contribution plans.\nResults of Operations\nBelow is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nOverview\nOne of the most significant factors influencing net flows and AUM is the investment performance of our various strategies. As an active manager, it is typical for our investment strategies to exhibit portfolio positioning that is notably divergent from benchmarks and common market indices. We believe this is a strength of our investment approach, although it can cause substantial performance deviations, both positive and negative, versus common benchmarks. In general, our investment processes have a preference for risk management, focusing heavily on fundamentals and valuations. Historically, we have tended to provide a degree of downside protection in adverse markets, while having participated somewhat less than fully in bull markets. Broadly speaking, we expect our investment approach to reduce volatility and create a smoother performance pattern over time, and we believe these characteristics are desirable and an attractive differentiator in our industry. As a result, the overall performance of our suite of investment strategies often differs from many others in the industry, potentially causing the results of our operations to, at times, also diverge.\nOther components impacting our operating results include:\n\u2022asset-based fee rates and changes in those rates;\n\u2022the composition of our AUM among various portfolios, sales channels and client types;\n\u2022changes in our variable costs, including incentive compensation and distribution, servicing and custody expenses, which are affected by our investment performance, level of our AUM and revenue; and\n\u2022fixed costs, including changes to base compensation, vendor-related costs and investment spending on new products.\nAssets Under Management and Investment Performance\nThe following tables reflect the indicated components of our AUM for our sales channels for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n________________________\n(1)Transfers of client assets between portfolios are included in gross client inflows and gross client outflows.\n(2)Market appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on assets under management, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends.\n(3)AUM and gross client flows between sales channels have been estimated based upon preliminary data. For a limited portion of our mutual fund AUM, reporting by sales channel is not available at the time of this report. Such estimates have no impact on total AUM, total cash flows, or AUM by investment portfolio reported in the table above.\nThe following tables reflect the indicated components of our AUM for our portfolios for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n________________________\n(1)Transfers of client assets between portfolios are included in gross client inflows and gross client outflows.\n(2)Market appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on assets under management, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends.\nRevenues\nOur revenues primarily consist of investment management fees earned from managing our clients' AUM. We earn our investment management fees as a percentage of our clients' AUM either as of a specified date or on a daily basis. Our investment management fees can fluctuate based on the average fee rate for our investment management products, which are affected by the composition of our AUM among various portfolios and investment vehicles.\nWe serve as the investment adviser for the Fund, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust. The mutual funds are open-end mutual funds designed to meet the needs of a range of institutional and other investors. The collective investment trusts are for qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans. These mutual funds and collective investment trusts comprised $5.5 billion, or 28%, of our AUM as of December 31, 2020. We also serve as the investment advisor to all of our separately managed accounts, managing $14.6 billion, or 72% of our AUM as of December 31, 2020, including assets managed as a sub-advisor to pooled investment vehicles. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our revenue earned from clients located in the United States was 98% and 99%, respectively.\nWe earn distribution and servicing fees for providing services to our affiliated mutual funds. Revenue is computed and earned daily based on a percentage of AUM.\nWe earn custodial service fees for administrative and safeguarding services performed by Exeter Trust Company, our New Hampshire-chartered trust company. Fees are calculated as a percentage of the client's market value with additional fees for certain transactions.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we completed the effort to restructure fees for many of our mutual fund and collective trust vehicles. The impacts on our overall revenue margins and operating expenses are described below in the discussion of results for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOperating Expenses\nOur largest operating expenses are employee compensation and related costs, discussed further below, with a significant portion of these expenses varying in a direct relationship to our absolute and relative investment management performance, as well as AUM and revenues. We review our operating expenses in relation to the investment market environment and changes in our revenues. However, we are generally willing to make expenditures as necessary, even when faced with declining rates of growth in revenues in order to support our investment products, our client service levels, strategic initiatives and our long-term value.\n\u2022Compensation and related costs. Employee compensation and related costs represent our largest expense, including employee salaries and benefits, incentive compensation to investment and sales professionals, compensation issued under our long-term incentive plan as well as equity compensation. These costs are affected by changes in the employee headcount, the mix of existing job descriptions, competitive factors, the addition of new skill sets and variations in the level of our AUM and revenues. These costs are also impacted by the number of awards granted under our equity plan and the amount of deferred cash awards granted under our long-term incentive plan. Incentive compensation for our research team considers the cumulative impact of both absolute and relative investment performance over historical time periods, with more weight placed on the recent periods. As such, incentive compensation paid to our research team will vary, in part, based on absolute and relative investment performance.\n\u2022Distribution, servicing and custody expenses. Distribution, servicing and custody expense represent amounts paid to various intermediaries for distribution, shareholder servicing, administrative servicing and custodial services. These expenses generally increase or decrease in line with changes in our mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM or services performed by these intermediaries. During the first quarter of 2019, we completed the effort, begun in 2017, of restructuring fees across our mutual funds. The financial impacts were a reduction in the management fees on existing business, and an offsetting reduction in related distribution, servicing and custody expenses. Given the overall pressure on fees that all active managers are facing, we believe that bringing our fund fees to a more competitive level will enhance our ability to attract additional assets in the future.\n\u2022Other operating costs. Other operating costs include accounting, legal and other professional service fees, technology, occupancy and facility costs, travel and entertainment expenses, insurance, market data service expenses and all other miscellaneous costs associated with managing the day-to-day operations of our business.\nNon-Operating Income (Loss)\nNon-operating income (loss) includes interest expense, interest and dividend income, changes in liability under the tax receivable agreement (\"TRA\") entered into between Manning & Napier and the other holders of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group, gains (losses) related to investment securities sales and changes in values of those investment securities designated as equity investments, at fair value and gain on sale of business.\nWe expect the interest and investment components of non-operating income (loss) to fluctuate based on market conditions, the performance of our investments and the overall amount of our investments held by the Company to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes and short-term investment for cash management opportunities.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company is comprised of entities that have elected to be treated as either a limited liability company (\"LLC\") or a C-Corporation.\u201d As such, the entities functioning as LLC's are not liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal or most state and local income taxes on their earnings, and their earnings (losses) will be included in the personal income tax returns of each entity's unit holders. The entities functioning as C-Corporations are liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal and state and local income taxes on their earnings and losses, respectively.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nManning & Napier, Inc. holds an economic interest of approximately 88.6% in Manning & Napier Group as of December 31, 2020, and as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning & Napier Group. As a result, the Company consolidates the financial results of Manning & Napier Group and records a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations represents the portion of earnings attributable to the economic interest in Manning & Napier Group held by the noncontrolling interests.\nAccounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and the related rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates or\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates or assumptions and may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial condition. Our management has identified the following significant accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management's judgment and estimates.\nThese policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below. Please also refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nInvestment Management: Investment management fees are computed as a percentage of AUM. Our performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time.\nSeparately managed accounts are paid in advance, typically for a semi-annual or quarterly period, or in arrears, typically for a monthly or quarterly period. When investment management fees are paid in advance, we defer the revenue as a contract liability and recognize it over the applicable period. When investment management fees are paid in arrears, we estimate revenue and record a contract asset (accrued accounts receivable) based on AUM as of the most recent month end date.\nMutual funds and collective investment trust investment management revenue is calculated and earned daily based on AUM. Revenue is presented net of cash rebates and fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds. We also have agreements with third parties who provide recordkeeping and administrative services for employee benefit plans participating in the collective investment trusts. We are acting as an agent on behalf of the employee benefit plan sponsors, therefore, investment management revenue is recorded net of fees paid to third party service providers.\nAs of January 1, 2020, we revised the presentation of investment management revenue within our consolidated statements of operations. Investment management revenue, previously presented by investment vehicle, has been disaggregated to present investment management revenue by sales channel.\nDistribution and shareholder servicing: We receive distribution and servicing fees for providing services to our affiliated mutual funds. Revenue is computed and earned daily based on a percentage of AUM. The performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. We have agreements with third parties who provide distribution and administrative services for our mutual funds. The agreements are evaluated to determine whether revenue should be reported gross or net of payments to third-party service providers. We control the services provided and act as a principal in the relationship. Therefore, distribution and shareholder servicing revenue is recorded gross of fees paid to third parties.\nCustodial services: Custodial service fees are calculated as a percentage of the client's market value with additional fees charged for certain transactions. For the safeguarding and administrative services that are subject to a percentage of market value fee, our performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. Revenue for transactions assigned a stand-alone selling price is recognized in the period which the transaction is executed. Custodial service fees are billed monthly in arrears. We have agreements with third parties who provide safeguarding, record keeping and administrative services for their clients. We control the services provided and act as a principal in the relationship. Therefore, custodial service revenue is recorded gross of fees paid to third parties.\nBecause the majority of our revenues are earned based on AUM that has been determined using fair value methods and since market appreciation/depreciation has a significant impact on our revenue, we have presented our AUM using the GAAP framework for measuring fair value. A fair value hierarchy is provided that gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following three-tier fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value:\n\u2022Level 1-observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities;\n\u2022Level 2-other significant observable inputs (including but not limited to quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment rates, credit risk, etc.); and\n\u2022Level 3-significant unobservable inputs (including our own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).\nThe table below summarizes the approximate amount of AUM for the periods indicated for which fair value is measured based on Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3:\n\nSubstantially all our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, and we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM, as discussed in this Annual Report under Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nAll other revenue earned by us is recognized on a GAAP accounting basis as earned per the terms of the specific contract.\nConsolidation\nWe assess each legal entity in which we hold a variable interest to determine whether consolidation is appropriate at the onset of the relationship and upon certain reconsideration events. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in the entity by evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity (\"VOE\") or a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") under GAAP. Assessing whether an entity is a VOE or VIE and if it requires consolidation involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include an entity's purpose and design, a company's ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and whether a company is obligated to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. The standard also requires ongoing assessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. When utilizing the VOE model, controlling financial interest is generally defined as majority ownership of voting interests.\nWe serve as the investment adviser for the Fund, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts ( CIT\u201d) and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust, which are legal entities, the business and affairs of which are managed by their respective boards of directors. As a result, each of these entities is a VOE. We hold, in limited cases, direct investments in a fund (which are made on the same terms as are available to other investors) and consolidate each of these entities where it has a controlling financial interest or a majority voting interest.\nWe make initial seed investments in sponsored investment portfolios to develop new products and services for our clients. The original seed investment may be held in a separately managed account, comprised solely of our investments, or within a mutual fund, where our investment may represent all or only a portion of the total equity invested in the mutual fund. We evaluate our seed investments on a regular basis and consolidate such mutual funds for which we hold a controlling financial interest. When we no longer hold a financial controlling interest, we deconsolidate the fund and classify the remaining investment as either an equity method investment or as equity investments, at fair value, as applicable.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Manning & Napier holds an economic interest of approximately 88.6% in Manning & Napier Group, and as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning & Napier Group. As a result, we consolidate the financial results of Manning & Napier Group and record a noncontrolling interest on our consolidated statements of financial condition with respect to the remaining economic interest in Manning & Napier Group held by M&N Group Holdings and Manning & Napier Capital Company, LLC (\"MNCC\").\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. We attribute all goodwill associated with past acquisitions to our single reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit associated with the goodwill to the reporting unit's recorded value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its recorded value an impairment loss will be recorded.\nThe annual test of goodwill indicated that there were no facts or circumstances occurring in 2020 suggesting possible impairment. The impairment tests included certain underlying key assumptions regarding future overall market trends and our operating performance. If actual future market results and our operating performance vary unfavorably to those included in our financial forecast, we may be subject to impairment charges related to its goodwill.\nIncome Tax Provision\nManagement judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance that might be required against deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020, we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. In the event that sufficient taxable income does not result in future years, among other things, a valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets may be required. Because\nthe determination of our annual income tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that the actual results will vary from those recorded in our financial statements. Hence, we recognize additions to and reductions in income tax expense during a reporting period that pertains to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and our actual tax returns and tax audits are completed.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized.\nPayments Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nAs a result of Manning & Napier's purchase of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group or exchange for Class A common stock of Manning & Napier for Class A units of Manning & Napier Group and Manning & Napier Group's election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code, we expect to benefit from depreciation and amortization deductions from an increase in tax basis of tangible and intangible assets of Manning & Napier Group. Those deductions allocated to us will be taken into account in reporting our taxable income.\nIn connection with our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), the TRA was entered into between Manning & Napier and the holders of Manning & Napier Group, pursuant to which Manning & Napier is required to pay to such holders 85% of the applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax that Manning & Napier actually realizes, or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances, as a result of (i) certain tax attributes of their units sold to Manning & Napier or exchanged (for shares of Class A common stock) and that are created as a result of the sales or exchanges and payments under the TRA and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest.\nAt December 31, 2020, we have recorded a total liability of $19.0 million, representing the payments due to the selling unit holders under the TRA. Payments are anticipated to be made annually commencing from the date of each event that gives rise to the TRA benefits. The actual amount and timing of any payments may vary from this estimate due to a number of factors, including a material change in the relevant tax law or our failure to earn sufficient taxable income to realize all estimated tax benefits. The expected payment obligation assumes no additional uncertain tax positions that would impact the TRAs.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent accounting pronouncements,\" included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nAssets Under Management\nThe following table reflects changes in our AUM for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n________________________\n(1)Transfers of client assets between portfolios are included in gross client inflows and gross client outflows.\n(2)Market appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on AUM, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends.\n(3)AUM and gross client flows between sales channels have been estimated based upon preliminary data. For a limited portion of our mutual fund AUM, reporting by sales channel is not available at the time of this report. Such estimates have no impact on total AUM, total cash flows, or AUM by investment portfolio reported in the table above.\nThe total AUM increase of $0.6 billion, or 3%, to $20.1 billion at December 31, 2020 from $19.5 billion at December 31, 2019 was attributable to $3.0 billion of market appreciation, partially offset by net client outflows of $2.3 billion and other changes. Net client outflows consisted of approximately $0.5 billion of net outflows from the wealth management channel and $1.8 billion from the institutional and intermediary channel. By portfolio, the rates of change in AUM from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 consisted of a $0.6 billion, or 11% increase in our equity portfolio, and a less than $0.1 billion, or 1% increase in our blended asset portfolio.\nWhile many of our key strategies achieved strong relative returns in 2020, which made our three- and five-year relative returns competitive, we attribute our 2020 net cash outflows to the lags with which improved investment results translate into new business. We believe that our ability to improve cash flows going forward will depend on our ability to sustain the improved investment performance we achieved over the past year and execute on our strategic initiatives focused on gathering and retaining client assets.\nThe composition of our AUM was 44% in wealth management and 56% in institutional and intermediary as of December 31, 2020, a shift from 45% in wealth management and 55% in institutional and intermediary at December 31, 2019. The composition of our AUM across portfolios at December 31, 2020 was 67% in blended assets, 28% in equity, and 5% in fixed income, compared to 69% in blended assets, 26% in equity, and 5% in fixed income at December 31, 2019.\nWith regard to our wealth management channel, gross client inflows of $0.9 billion were offset by approximately $1.5 billion of gross client outflows during the year ended December 31, 2020. The $0.9 billion of gross client inflows included $0.7 billion into our blended asset portfolios, $0.1 billion into our equity portfolios and $0.1 billion into fixed income. Our blended asset and equity portfolios experienced gross client outflows of approximately $1.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, with the remainder in outflows coming from fixed income.\nNet client outflows of $1.8 billion from our institutional and intermediary channel included gross client inflows of $1.5 billion offset by gross client outflows of $3.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross client inflows into our blended asset portfolios, represented $0.9 billion, or 58% and equity portfolios had $0.5 billion or 36%, of institutional and intermediary gross client inflows during the year ended December 31, 2020. With regard to gross client outflows, $2.4 billion, or 75%, of institutional and intermediary gross client outflows were from blended asset institutional and intermediary products.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations and other data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nOur Business\nManning & Napier, Inc. is an independent investment management firm that provides our clients with a broad range of financial solutions and investment strategies, including wealth management services. Founded in 1970 and headquartered in Fairport, New York, we serve a diversified client base of high-net-worth individuals and institutions, including 401(k) plans, pension plans, Taft-Hartley plans, endowments and foundations.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWe are addressing the challenges of COVID-19 by protecting the health and well-being of our employees, while servicing our clients and leveraging technology to fully support our business needs in a primarily digital manner. The impact of COVID-19 on our investment performance, financial statements, capital and liquidity, and our business operations are further discussed below:\n\u2022Client Performance Impact: As a result of our ability to rapidly adapt to a remote work environment, we believe we were able to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on client performance. Additionally, due to the significant increase in volatility throughout the year, discussed in more detail in the next section, we were able to capitalize on the market environment by delivering strong results for clients in 2020.\n\u2022Financial Statement Impact: Our revenues consist primarily of investment management fees typically calculated as a percentage of the market value of our assets under management (\"AUM\"), and they are dependent on the value and composition of our AUM. As of December 31, 2020, AUM was $20.1 billion, an increase from $17.1 billion as of March 31, 2020. This 18% increase came on the heels of a market rebound primarily beginning in the second quarter, with approximately $4.9 billion of market appreciation partially offset by approximately $1.9 billion of net client outflows since March 31, 2020. Going forward, we believe the pandemic may negatively impact our operational results, cash flows, and financial position if our clients are adversely impacted by the economic results of the pandemic.\n\u2022Capital and Liquidity Impact: Our financial condition is stable, allowing us to effectively manage the financial impacts of COVID-19. We believe our capital structure should provide us with sufficient resources and flexibility to meet present and future cash needs. The Board of Directors has not approved a quarterly cash dividend on our Class A common stock since the dividend paid on May 1, 2020. Given the uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs.\n\u2022Business Operations Impact: For the health and well-being of our employees, we have modified our business practices in accordance with social distancing guidelines to encourage work-from-home arrangements, and we have restricted business-related travel. Our technology capabilities have allowed us to maintain sales and client servicing activity through digital collaboration platforms and digital marketing efforts. We believe our 2020 results, with gross client inflows comparable to prior periods and gross client outflows reduced from prior levels, indicate that our sales strategy is gaining traction. Our ability to adequately maintain our operations, internal controls and client relationships has not been adversely affected by these modifications.\nWe continue to assess the risks associated with COVID-19 and to mitigate them where possible. For further discussion regarding the potential future impacts of COVID-19 and related economic conditions on the Company's financial statements, capital and liquidity, and business operations, see \"Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors.\"\nMarket Developments\nLast year was undoubtedly volatile, but in the end, global equity performance was again strong in 2020. After one of the sharpest stock market selloffs ever, equities bounced back quickly and then sustained their gains throughout the remainder of the year. The rapid rally was led by strength in growth-style equities, which vastly outperformed their value-style counterparts for the full year, and further extended their recent multi-year run of relative outperformance. International equities delivered solid gains as well, with emerging markets somewhat outperforming international developed markets.\nIn fixed income, rates fell significantly during the first quarter and remained at historically low levels throughout the rest of the year. Falling interest rates drove strong performance, boosting bond market returns last year, but we expect low starting yields to create a challenging long-term environment going forward.\nWe believe the economic recovery is showing signs of decelerating and appears at risk of stalling out. At the same time, monetary policy remains extraordinarily accommodative, and governments appear more willing than ever to implement aggressive fiscal measures to boost growth. These and other variables are creating a highly uncertain near-term macroeconomic environment.\nConsidering that equity and fixed income valuations are both at very elevated levels, and given today's mixed economic backdrop, we expect modest returns for the near- to intermediate-term. As an active manager, we believe we are well positioned to help investors navigate a potentially choppy environment in the years ahead as they seek to meet their long-term financial goals and objectives.\nBusiness Review\nOur firm is focused on four key strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to establishing a solid foundation for future success. They are as follows: delivering excellent investment results for clients; improving sales productivity while providing exceptional client service; modernizing our technological infrastructure and increasing operational efficiency; and ensuring a talent-rich, diverse organization with a great culture. We made important progress on each of these measures throughout 2020.\nInvestment Excellence\nThe performance of our investment strategies was broadly excellent in 2020. We delivered a degree of downside protection in many of our strategies during the market volatility of the first quarter, and then substantially participated in the subsequent market recovery throughout the remainder of the year. We believe our absolute results, relative outperformance, and the performance pattern we delivered, are all indicative of the power of our time-tested research processes and disciplines.\nIn general, we believe in being patient and flexible. It is undeniable that both equity and debt valuations are elevated, but we still believe there are parts of global equity markets that remain attractive. We will continue to be opportunistic on behalf of clients as we seek to avoid areas of undue risk while capitalizing on these select areas of opportunity.\nIt is important to note that in our traditional bottom-up portfolios, in equities, we are neither dogmatic growth nor value investors. Rather, our disciplines give us very specific tools to evaluate both what we term profile\u201d stocks, which would look at home in the portfolios of growth managers, as well as what we term hurdle rate\u201d and bankable deal\u201d stocks, which have classic value characteristics. We believe this flexibility was critical to our strong results last year and remains one of our key differentiators.\nFinally, we should note that the magnitude of our outperformance in many of our strategies should be viewed as an unusual occurrence, as should the very high proportion of our strategies that outperformed. While we will always strive to deliver excellent relative results for clients, we expect to be hard-pressed to consistently repeat our near-universally excellent investment strategy results in 2020.\nSales Productivity\nOur rate of outflows decreased substantially in 2020, by approximately $2.5 billion when compared to 2019, reflecting superior investment results and excellent client service during the pandemic. The ultimate measure of improvements in our client-facing areas will be positive net flows. While we continued to sustain net outflows in 2020, it was at a much lower rate than prior years.\nWe increased our investment in our client facing teams throughout 2020. We hired five new Financial Consultants in Wealth Management, bringing our total to 19. Our new hires did not bring books of business, and we anticipate that they will ramp up in productivity over the next few years. We created team structures in multiple geographies, which has enhanced client service and increased our capacity to generate new business. Additionally, we also added a dedicated Consultant Relations Director in the fourth quarter, supporting our institutional business.\nIn February 2021, we implemented a revised pricing plan for new Wealth Management clients. New wealth management clients will be charged a bundled fee that incorporates wealth planning and advice, investment solutions, and custody. This fee is higher than our current investment-only pricing and will be additive to revenues, over time. Current clients' fees will be grandfathered and will not change. Also, institutions who use us for an asset class sleeve of a larger portfolio and not for comprehensive advice will also be exempt.\nOperational Efficiency\nOur technological overhaul was in the thick of the execution phase throughout 2020 as we pushed forward across several key initiatives simultaneously, replacing the entirety of our technology infrastructure.\nBy the end of the year, we launched the first deliverable from our implementation of InvestCloud technology to support all our distribution initiatives. That first deliverable was a new client portal that has been very well received by clients across channels. We also completed the implementation of Workday's general ledger functionality in 2020 and will be rolling out its budgeting and financial analysis module in 2021. In addition, in 2021, we will be implementing Workday applications for human resources and talent management. We made important progress in implementing Charles River's technology for trade order management, trading and portfolio compliance, and portfolio implementation in 2020. Important steps remain and completion is targeted by the end of 2021.\nThe fully integrated suite of software-as-a-service platforms that we are implementing will enable substantial operating efficiencies, better client experiences, increased targeting and discipline in sales and service, improved productivity in trade processing and portfolio implementation, and greater and more actionable business insights.\nPeople & Culture\nOur fourth strategic initiative is to ensure that we have a talent-rich, diverse and inclusive team with a powerful, distinctive culture.\nTalent density is the lifeblood of our business: it helps us analyze, manage, and optimize our investment strategies. It helps us relate, reach, and connect to more people, amplifying our strategies, solutions, and story; and it helps us innovate and remain nimble in our evolving, highly competitive industry. We want to be a destination of choice for the most capable and promising talent. Ours is largely a home-grown team, with the majority of staff entering as recent graduates, so we are focused on finding the best, developing the best, and retaining the best.\nIt is our belief that, in principle, the demographics of our firm should broadly reflect the demographics of our nation and the communities in which we do business. We are committed to getting there but acknowledge that it will take time, and we must commit to making consistent progress towards becoming a more inclusive organization.\nAs has been repeatedly demonstrated, we have no doubt that greater diversity of background, experience, and perspective, lends itself to stronger decision making, a more solid internal culture, and superior business outcomes for all stakeholders. Our corporate culture will embrace and celebrate all our differences, for they will make us a stronger, more successful, and more lasting business.\nWe believe our compensation philosophy is designed to achieve alignment between our employees' interests and those of our clients and shareholders. We have made further progress on this initiative through the increase in employee ownership in the Company, coupled with the implementation of a deferred compensation plan beginning in 2021, whereby a fraction of incentive compensation for our most highly compensated employees with be invested in our investment products and vested over a multi-year period. We believe that implementing this plan is an important step in increasing employee investment in our strategies and will provide additional short-term earnings relief during 2021.\nCorporate Structure\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, pursuant to the annual exchange process, approximately 60.0 million Class A units of Manning & Napier Group, LLC (\"Manning & Napier Group\") were tendered for cash or shares of the Company's Class A common stock. In early April 2020, the independent directors, on behalf of the Company as managing member of Manning & Napier Group, decided to settle the transaction as a redemption, utilizing approximately $90.8 million in cash. Manning & Napier Group completed the redemption on May 11, 2020, with payment made from its cash, cash equivalents and proceeds from the sale of investment securities. The Class A units were subsequently retired, and as a result, our ownership of Manning & Napier Group increased from 19.5% to 88.2% as of May 11, 2020. On February 3, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $10.0 million of Manning & Napier Inc. Class A common shares. The authority to repurchase shares will be exercised from time to time as market conditions warrant, is subject to regulatory considerations and will expire on December 31, 2021. The timing, amount, and other terms and conditions of any repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on a variety of factors, including the market price of shares, general market and economic conditions, and legal requirements.\nWe believe our full year 2020 was broadly very positive as we continue to execute on our long-term strategic plans, focusing on rebuilding the foundation of our firm in a way that positions us for sustained success.\nOur Solutions\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management fees earned from providing advisory services to separately managed accounts and to mutual funds and collective investment trusts-including those offered by Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC (\"MNA\"), the Manning & Napier Fund, Inc.(the \"Fund\"), Exeter Trust Company, and Rainier Investment Management, LLC (\"Rainier\").\nOur separate accounts are primarily distributed through our wealth management sales channel, where our financial consultants form relationships with high-net-worth individuals, endowments, foundations, and retirement plans. To a lesser extent, we also obtain a portion of our separate account distribution via third parties, either through our intermediary sales channel where national brokerage firm representatives or independent financial advisors select our separate account strategies for their clients, through our platform/sub-advisor relationships, where unaffiliated registered investment advisors approve our strategies for their product platforms, or through institutional consultants. Our separate account strategies are a primary driver of our blended asset portfolios for high-net-worth, middle market institutional clients and financial intermediaries. In contrast, larger institutions and unaffiliated registered investment advisor platforms are a driver of our separate account equity portfolios.\nOur mutual funds and collective investment trusts are primarily distributed through financial intermediaries, including brokers, financial advisors, retirement plan advisors and platform relationships. We also distribute our mutual fund and collective investment trusts through our institutional representatives, particularly within the defined contribution, Taft-Hartley,\nand institutional marketplace. Our mutual fund and collective investment trust strategies are an important driver of our blended asset class and single asset class portfolios.\nAssets Under Management\nOur sales efforts distinctly separate the Wealth Management clients to which we deliver holistic solutions, including high-net-worth families, endowments and foundations, and small and mid-sized business, from our Institutional and Intermediary clients, including third party advisors, platforms and consultants, as well as larger institutions and Taft-Hartley clients.

Assets under advisement related to our model-delivery business totaled approximately $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue earned on these services is included in other revenue within our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur wealth management channel represented 44% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2020. Blended portfolios are the most significant portion of wealth management assets, representing 87% of wealth management AUM. Equity and fixed income portfolios represent 10% and 3% respectively, of wealth management AUM.\nOur institutional and intermediary channel represented 56% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2020. Blended portfolios are also the largest portion of institutional and intermediary assets at 52% of AUM, followed by equity and fixed income portfolios at 41% and 7%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, blended portfolios account for 67% of our total AUM at $13.6 billion, an increase of $0.1 billion from blended portfolio AUM of $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019. Blended portfolio AUM is similar across both distribution channels, with 57% in wealth management and 43% in institutional and intermediary. Equity portfolios account for 28% of our total AUM, at $5.5 billion, an 11% increase from December 31, 2019, when equity portfolios were at $5.0 billion. Of equity portfolio AUM, 84% is in the institutional and intermediary channel, and 16% is in the wealth management channel. Fixed income portfolios account for 5% of total AUM at $1.0 billion, consistent with fixed income portfolio AUM at December 31, 2019. Consistent with equity portfolio AUM, the majority of fixed income assets come through the institutional and intermediary channel at 74% and 26% of fixed income AUM is in the wealth management channel.\nWe also have relationships with manager research teams at platforms in order to distribute our funds within advisory programs, or through placement on platforms' approved lists of funds. To facilitate our relationships with intermediaries, we currently have approximately 242 dealer relationships. These relationships are important to our retail business as well as our defined contribution business, including our target date collective trusts.\nOur institutional and Taft-Hartley sales team promotes our strategies to large institutional clients with which we have direct relationships, as well as to the consultants that advise them. In 2021 we added a dedicated resource to focus on institutional consultants. Additionally, we have relationships with middle-market and large market defined contribution plan sponsors seeking to use our target date collective investment trusts and Pro-Blend target risk mutual funds as default options on their investment menu. These sponsors also use our single asset class strategies as options in their defined contribution plans.\nResults of Operations\nBelow is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nOverview\nOne of the most significant factors influencing net flows and AUM is the investment performance of our various strategies. As an active manager, it is typical for our investment strategies to exhibit portfolio positioning that is notably divergent from benchmarks and common market indices. We believe this is a strength of our investment approach, although it can cause substantial performance deviations, both positive and negative, versus common benchmarks. In general, our investment processes have a preference for risk management, focusing heavily on fundamentals and valuations. Historically, we have tended to provide a degree of downside protection in adverse markets, while having participated somewhat less than fully in bull markets. Broadly speaking, we expect our investment approach to reduce volatility and create a smoother performance pattern over time, and we believe these characteristics are desirable and an attractive differentiator in our industry. As a result, the overall performance of our suite of investment strategies often differs from many others in the industry, potentially causing the results of our operations to, at times, also diverge.\nOther components impacting our operating results include:\n\u2022asset-based fee rates and changes in those rates;\n\u2022the composition of our AUM among various portfolios, sales channels and client types;\n\u2022changes in our variable costs, including incentive compensation and distribution, servicing and custody expenses, which are affected by our investment performance, level of our AUM and revenue; and\n\u2022fixed costs, including changes to base compensation, vendor-related costs and investment spending on new products.\nAssets Under Management and Investment

appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on assets under management, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends.\nRevenues\nOur revenues primarily consist of investment management fees earned from managing our clients' AUM. We earn our investment management fees as a percentage of our clients' AUM either as of a specified date or on a daily basis. Our investment management fees can fluctuate based on the average fee rate for our investment management products, which are affected by the composition of our AUM among various portfolios and investment vehicles.\nWe serve as the investment adviser for the Fund, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust. The mutual funds are open-end mutual funds designed to meet the needs of a range of institutional and other investors. The collective investment trusts are for qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans. These mutual funds and collective investment trusts comprised $5.5 billion, or 28%, of our AUM as of December 31, 2020. We also serve as the investment advisor to all of our separately managed accounts, managing $14.6 billion, or 72% of our AUM as of December 31, 2020, including assets managed as a sub-advisor to pooled investment vehicles. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our revenue earned from clients located in the United States was 98% and 99%, respectively.\nWe earn distribution and servicing fees for providing services to our affiliated mutual funds. Revenue is computed and earned daily based on a percentage of AUM.\nWe earn custodial service fees for administrative and safeguarding services performed by Exeter Trust Company, our New Hampshire-chartered trust company. Fees are calculated as a percentage of the client's market value with additional fees for certain transactions.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we completed the effort to restructure fees for many of our mutual fund and collective trust vehicles. The impacts on our overall revenue margins and operating expenses are described below in the discussion of results for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOperating Expenses\nOur largest operating expenses are employee compensation and related costs, discussed further below, with a significant portion of these expenses varying in a direct relationship to our absolute and relative investment management performance, as well as AUM and revenues. We review our operating expenses in relation to the investment market environment and changes in our revenues. However, we are generally willing to make expenditures as necessary, even when faced with declining rates of growth in revenues in order to support our investment products, our client service levels, strategic initiatives and our long-term value.\n\u2022Compensation and related costs. Employee compensation and related costs represent our largest expense, including employee salaries and benefits, incentive compensation to investment and sales professionals, compensation issued under our long-term incentive plan as well as equity compensation. These costs are affected by changes in the employee headcount, the mix of existing job descriptions, competitive factors, the addition of new skill sets and variations in the level of our AUM and revenues. These costs are also impacted by the number of awards granted under our equity plan and the amount of deferred cash awards granted under our long-term incentive plan. Incentive compensation for our research team considers the cumulative impact of both absolute and relative investment performance over historical time periods, with more weight placed on the recent periods. As such, incentive compensation paid to our research team will vary, in part, based on absolute and relative investment performance.\n\u2022Distribution, servicing and custody expenses. Distribution, servicing and custody expense represent amounts paid to various intermediaries for distribution, shareholder servicing, administrative servicing and custodial services. These expenses generally increase or decrease in line with changes in our mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM or services performed by these intermediaries. During the first quarter of 2019, we completed the effort, begun in 2017, of restructuring fees across our mutual funds. The financial impacts were a reduction in the management fees on existing business, and an offsetting reduction in related distribution, servicing and custody expenses. Given the overall pressure on fees that all active managers are facing, we believe that bringing our fund fees to a more competitive level will enhance our ability to attract additional assets in the future.\n\u2022Other operating costs. Other operating costs include accounting, legal and other professional service fees, technology, occupancy and facility costs, travel and entertainment expenses, insurance, market data service expenses and all other miscellaneous costs associated with managing the day-to-day operations of our business.\nNon-Operating Income (Loss)\nNon-operating income (loss) includes interest expense, interest and dividend income, changes in liability under the tax receivable agreement (\"TRA\") entered into between Manning & Napier and the other holders of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group, gains (losses) related to investment securities sales and changes in values of those investment securities designated as equity investments, at fair value and gain on sale of business.\nWe expect the interest and investment components of non-operating income (loss) to fluctuate based on market conditions, the performance of our investments and the overall amount of our investments held by the Company to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes and short-term investment for cash management opportunities.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company is comprised of entities that have elected to be treated as either a limited liability company (\"LLC\") or a C-Corporation.\u201d As such, the entities functioning as LLC's are not liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal or most state and local income taxes on their earnings, and their earnings (losses) will be included in the personal income tax returns of each entity's unit holders. The entities functioning as C-Corporations are liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal and state and local income taxes on their earnings and losses, respectively.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nManning & Napier, Inc. holds an economic interest of approximately 88.6% in Manning & Napier Group as of December 31, 2020, and as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning & Napier Group. As a result, the Company consolidates the financial results of Manning & Napier Group and records a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations represents the portion of earnings attributable to the economic interest in Manning & Napier Group held by the noncontrolling interests.\nAccounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and the related rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates or\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates or assumptions and may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial condition. Our management has identified the following significant accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management's judgment and estimates.\nThese policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below. Please also refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nInvestment Management: Investment management fees are computed as a percentage of AUM. Our performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time.\nSeparately managed accounts are paid in advance, typically for a semi-annual or quarterly period, or in arrears, typically for a monthly or quarterly period. When investment management fees are paid in advance, we defer the revenue as a contract liability and recognize it over the applicable period. When investment management fees are paid in arrears, we estimate revenue and record a contract asset (accrued accounts receivable) based on AUM as of the most recent month end date.\nMutual funds and collective investment trust investment management revenue is calculated and earned daily based on AUM. Revenue is presented net of cash rebates and fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds. We also have agreements with third parties who provide recordkeeping and administrative services for employee benefit plans participating in the collective investment trusts. We are acting as an agent on behalf of the employee benefit plan sponsors, therefore, investment management revenue is recorded net of fees paid to third party service providers.\nAs of January 1, 2020, we revised the presentation of investment management revenue within our consolidated statements of operations. Investment management revenue, previously presented by investment vehicle, has been disaggregated to present investment management revenue by sales channel.\nDistribution and shareholder servicing: We receive distribution and servicing fees for providing services to our affiliated mutual funds. Revenue is computed and earned daily based on a percentage of AUM. The performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. We have agreements with third parties who provide distribution and administrative services for our mutual funds. The agreements are evaluated to determine whether revenue should be reported gross or net of payments to third-party service providers. We control the services provided and act as a principal in the relationship. Therefore, distribution and shareholder servicing revenue is recorded gross of fees paid to third parties.\nCustodial services: Custodial service fees are calculated as a percentage of the client's market value with additional fees charged for certain transactions. For the safeguarding and administrative services that are subject to a percentage of market value fee, our performance obligation is a series of services that form part of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. Revenue for transactions assigned a stand-alone selling price is recognized in the period which the transaction is executed. Custodial service fees are billed monthly in arrears. We have agreements with third parties who provide safeguarding, record keeping and administrative services for their clients. We control the services provided and act as a principal in the relationship. Therefore, custodial service revenue is recorded gross of fees paid to third parties.\nBecause the majority of our revenues are earned based on AUM that has been determined using fair value methods and since market appreciation/depreciation has a significant impact on our revenue, we have presented our AUM using the GAAP framework for measuring fair value. A fair value hierarchy is provided that gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following three-tier fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value:\n\u2022Level 1-observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities;\n\u2022Level 2-other significant observable inputs (including but not limited to quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment rates, credit risk, etc.); and\n\u2022Level 3-significant unobservable inputs (including our own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).\nThe table below summarizes the approximate amount of AUM for the periods indicated for which fair value is measured based on Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Level 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 AUM </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,119 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 AUM </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,480 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubstantially all our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, and we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM, as discussed in this Annual Report under Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nAll other revenue earned by us is recognized on a GAAP accounting basis as earned per the terms of the specific contract.\nConsolidation\nWe assess each legal entity in which we hold a variable interest to determine whether consolidation is appropriate at the onset of the relationship and upon certain reconsideration events. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in the entity by evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity (\"VOE\") or a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") under GAAP. Assessing whether an entity is a VOE or VIE and if it requires consolidation involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include an entity's purpose and design, a company's ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and whether a company is obligated to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. The standard also requires ongoing assessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. When utilizing the VOE model, controlling financial interest is generally defined as majority ownership of voting interests.\nWe serve as the investment adviser for the Fund, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts ( CIT\u201d) and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust, which are legal entities, the business and affairs of which are managed by their respective boards of directors. As a result, each of these entities is a VOE. We hold, in limited cases, direct investments in a fund (which are made on the same terms as are available to other investors) and consolidate each of these entities where it has a controlling financial interest or a majority voting interest.\nWe make initial seed investments in sponsored investment portfolios to develop new products and services for our clients. The original seed investment may be held in a separately managed account, comprised solely of our investments, or within a mutual fund, where our investment may represent all or only a portion of the total equity invested in the mutual fund. We evaluate our seed investments on a regular basis and consolidate such mutual funds for which we hold a controlling financial interest. When we no longer hold a financial controlling interest, we deconsolidate the fund and classify the remaining investment as either an equity method investment or as equity investments, at fair value, as applicable.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Manning & Napier holds an economic interest of approximately 88.6% in Manning & Napier Group, and as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning & Napier Group. As a result, we consolidate the financial results of Manning & Napier Group and record a noncontrolling interest on our consolidated statements of financial condition with respect to the remaining economic interest in Manning & Napier Group held by M&N Group Holdings and Manning & Napier Capital Company, LLC (\"MNCC\").\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. We attribute all goodwill associated with past acquisitions to our single reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit associated with the goodwill to the reporting unit's recorded value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its recorded value an impairment loss will be recorded.\nThe annual test of goodwill indicated that there were no facts or circumstances occurring in 2020 suggesting possible impairment. The impairment tests included certain underlying key assumptions regarding future overall market trends and our operating performance. If actual future market results and our operating performance vary unfavorably to those included in our financial forecast, we may be subject to impairment charges related to its goodwill.\nIncome Tax Provision\nManagement judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance that might be required against deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020, we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. In the event that sufficient taxable income does not result in future years, among other things, a valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets may be required. Because\nthe determination of our annual income tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that the actual results will vary from those recorded in our financial statements. Hence, we recognize additions to and reductions in income tax expense during a reporting period that pertains to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and our actual tax returns and tax audits are completed.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized.\nPayments Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nAs a result of Manning & Napier's purchase of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group or exchange for Class A common stock of Manning & Napier for Class A units of Manning & Napier Group and Manning & Napier Group's election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code, we expect to benefit from depreciation and amortization deductions from an increase in tax basis of tangible and intangible assets of Manning & Napier Group. Those deductions allocated to us will be taken into account in reporting our taxable income.\nIn connection with our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), the TRA was entered into between Manning & Napier and the holders of Manning & Napier Group, pursuant to which Manning & Napier is required to pay to such holders 85% of the applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax that Manning & Napier actually realizes, or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances, as a result of (i) certain tax attributes of their units sold to Manning & Napier or exchanged (for shares of Class A common stock) and that are created as a result of the sales or exchanges and payments under the TRA and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest.\nAt December 31, 2020, we have recorded a total liability of $19.0 million, representing the payments due to the selling unit holders under the TRA. Payments are anticipated to be made annually commencing from the date of each event that gives rise to the TRA benefits. The actual amount and timing of any payments may vary from this estimate due to a number of factors, including a material change in the relevant tax law or our failure to earn sufficient taxable income to realize all estimated tax benefits. The expected payment obligation assumes no additional uncertain tax positions that would impact the TRAs.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,

assets between portfolios are included in gross client inflows and gross client outflows.\n(2)Market appreciation/(depreciation) and other includes investment gains/(losses) on AUM, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends.\n(3)AUM and gross client flows between sales channels have been estimated based upon preliminary data. For a limited portion of our mutual fund AUM, reporting by sales channel is not available at the time of this report. Such estimates have no impact on total AUM, total cash flows, or AUM by investment portfolio reported in the table above.\nThe total AUM increase of $0.6 billion, or 3%, to $20.1 billion at December 31, 2020 from $19.5 billion at December 31, 2019 was attributable to $3.0 billion of market appreciation, partially offset by net client outflows of $2.3 billion and other changes. Net client outflows consisted of approximately $0.5 billion of net outflows from the wealth management channel and $1.8 billion from the institutional and intermediary channel. By portfolio, the rates of change in AUM from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 consisted of a $0.6 billion, or 11% increase in our equity portfolio, and a less than $0.1 billion, or 1% increase in our blended asset portfolio.\nWhile many of our key strategies achieved strong relative returns in 2020, which made our three- and five-year relative returns competitive, we attribute our 2020 net cash outflows to the lags with which improved investment results translate into new business. We believe that our ability to improve cash flows going forward will depend on our ability to sustain the improved investment performance we achieved over the past year and execute on our strategic initiatives focused on gathering and retaining client assets.\nThe composition of our AUM was 44% in wealth management and 56% in institutional and intermediary as of December 31, 2020, a shift from 45% in wealth management and 55% in institutional and intermediary at December 31, 2019. The composition of our AUM across portfolios at December 31, 2020 was 67% in blended assets, 28% in equity, and 5% in fixed income, compared to 69% in blended assets, 26% in equity, and 5% in fixed income at December 31, 2019.\nWith regard to our wealth management channel, gross client inflows of $0.9 billion were offset by approximately $1.5 billion of gross client outflows during the year ended December 31, 2020. The $0.9 billion of gross client inflows included $0.7 billion into our blended asset portfolios, $0.1 billion into our equity portfolios and $0.1 billion into fixed income. Our blended asset and equity portfolios experienced gross client outflows of approximately $1.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, with the remainder in outflows coming from fixed income.\nNet client outflows of $1.8 billion from our institutional and intermediary channel included gross client inflows of $1.5 billion offset by gross client outflows of $3.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross client inflows into our blended asset portfolios, represented $0.9 billion, or 58% and equity portfolios had $0.5 billion or 36%, of institutional and intermediary gross client inflows during the year ended December 31, 2020. With regard to gross client outflows, $2.4 billion, or 75%, of institutional and intermediary gross client outflows were from blended asset institutional and intermediary products.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations and other data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except share data) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td>"}
