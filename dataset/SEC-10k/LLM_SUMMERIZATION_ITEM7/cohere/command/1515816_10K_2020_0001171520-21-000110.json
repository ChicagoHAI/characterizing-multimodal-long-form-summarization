MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is based on, and should be read in conjunction with our audited historical financial statements and related notes thereto as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOverview\nWe are a full service, vertically integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT focused on the acquisition, ownership and management of single and multi-tenant industrial properties, including distribution centers, warehouses, light industrial and small bay industrial properties. The Company Portfolio consists of 107 industrial properties located in eleven states with an aggregate of approximately 23.3 million rentable square feet leased to 351 different tenants.\nOur strategy is to acquire, own and manage single and multi-tenant industrial properties located in primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets, with access to large pools of skilled labor in the main industrial, distribution and logistics corridors of the United States. We seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a combination of dividends and capital appreciation.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nBusiness and Strategy\nOur core investment strategy is to acquire industrial properties located in primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets across the U.S. We expect to acquire these properties through third-party purchases and structured sale-leasebacks where we believe we can achieve high initial yields and strong ongoing cash-on-cash returns. In addition, we may make opportunistic acquisitions of industrial properties in primary markets that offer similar return characteristics.\nOur target markets are located in primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets, because we believe these markets tend to have less occupancy and rental rate volatility and less buyer competition relative to gateway markets. We also believe that the systematic aggregation of such properties will result in a diversified portfolio that will produce sustainable risk-adjusted returns. Future results of operations may be affected, either positively or negatively, by our ability to effectively execute this strategy.\nWe also intend to continue pursuing joint venture arrangements with institutional partners which could provide management fee income as well as residual profit-sharing income. Such joint ventures may involve investing in industrial assets that would be characterized as opportunistic or value-add investments. These may involve development or redevelopment strategies that may require significant up-front capital expenditures, lengthy lease-up periods and result in inconsistent cash flows. As such, these properties' risk profiles and return metrics would likely differ from the non-joint venture properties that we target for acquisition.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWhile we are not able to estimate the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating results at this time, the following discussion provides certain information regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and an overview of management's efforts to respond to anticipated impacts. While our results for the year ended December 31, 2020, were in line with our expectations, the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant and wide-ranging efforts of international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities in regions across the United States and the world to combat the spread of the virus, including substantial restrictions on the daily activities of individuals and the operations of many businesses, have significantly reduced economic activity throughout the country and increased volatility in the financial markets, which could negatively impact our results of operations in future periods.\nAs a result of the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment, we expect that such statistical and other information provided below will change, potentially significantly, going forward and may not be indicative of the actual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, cash flows and financial condition for future periods.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020, we have collected approximately 98.8% of recurring base rents and tenant recoveries billed for the fourth quarter of 2020; however, collections to-date may not be indicative of collections in any future period. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>We have received some rent relief requests from tenants at our properties, most often in the form of rent deferral requests. During the year ended 2020, the Company had entered into a limited number of such COVID-19 related rent deferral concessions representing 1.3% of $94.1 million of annualized base rent ( ABR\u201d). ABR is defined/calculated as the annualized monthly contractual base rent per the leases, excluding any rent abatements, as of December 31, 2020. As of the timing of this filing we have collected all of the deferred rents provided during 2020 and have not provided any additional rent deferrals or other rent concessions. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn an effort to stabilize our operations and attempt to manage the impact of COVID-19, we have taken a number of proactive measures to maintain the strength of our business, including the following:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>The health and safety of our employees and their families is a top priority. We have adapted our operations to protect employees, including by implementing a work from home policy, and our systems have enabled our team to work seamlessly. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>We are in frequent communication with our tenants and we are assisting them in identifying state and federal resources that may be available to support their businesses and employees during the pandemic, including stimulus funds that may be available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>We have approximately $27.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $86.5 million available on our line of credit as of December 31, 2020 to address near-term working capital and other liquidity needs. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRental Revenue\nWe receive income primarily from rental revenue from our properties. The amount of rental revenue generated by the Company Portfolio depends principally on the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, our ability to lease currently available space and space that becomes available as a result of lease expirations and on the rental rates at our properties. The Company Portfolio was approximately 96.4% and 96.6% occupied as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our occupancy rate is impacted by general market conditions in the geographic areas which our properties are located and the financial condition of tenants in our target markets.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and will be affected by economic and competitive conditions in the markets in which we operate and by the desirability of our individual properties. During the period from January 1, 2021 through to December 31, 2022, an aggregate of 33.0% of the annualized base rent leases in the Company Portfolio are scheduled to expire, which we believe will provide us an opportunity to adjust below market rates as market conditions continue to improve.\nThe table below reflects certain data about our new and renewed leases with terms of greater than six months executed in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Square\nFootage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Square Footage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Expiring Rent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>New Rent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Tenant Improvements $/SF/YR </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Lease Commissions $/SF/YR </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Renewals </td> <td> </td> <td>1,881,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>New Leases </td> <td> </td> <td>764,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.9% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2,645,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe Company Portfolio is located in various primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets, with access to large pools of skilled labor in the main industrial distribution and logistics corridors of the United States. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in these markets are likely to affect our overall performance.\nProperty Expenses\nOur rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and repair and maintenance costs. For the majority of the Company Portfolio, property expenses are controlled, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross lease expense reimbursement provisions in tenant leases. However, the terms of our tenant leases vary and in some instances the leases may provide that we are responsible for certain property expenses. Accordingly, our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property expenses to our tenants.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe expect to incur increased general and administrative expenses, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance and public reporting and compliance. In addition, we anticipate that our staffing levels will increase from current levels as of December 31, 2020 during the subsequent 12 to 24 months and, as a result, our general and administrative expenses will increase further.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our company's historical financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nWe believe our most critical accounting policies are the regular evaluation of whether the value of a real estate asset has been impaired and accounting for acquisitions. Each of these items involves estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature. We collect historical data and current market data, and based on our experience we analyze these assumptions in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes significant estimates regarding the allocation of tangible and intangible assets for real estate acquisitions and impairments of long-lived assets. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. Management adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012 and we believe that our organization and method of operation enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. We had no taxable income prior to electing REIT status. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any tax year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless we are able to obtain relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nWe generally acquire individual properties, and, in some instances, a portfolio of properties. When we acquire individual operating properties with the intention to hold the investment for the long-term, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components typically include land, building, intangible assets related to above and below market leases, value of costs to obtain tenants, and other assumed assets and liabilities, including debt. We consider Level 3 inputs such as the replacement cost of such assets, appraisals, property condition reports, comparable market rental data and other related information in determining the fair value of the tangible assets. The recorded fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities includes Level 3 inputs including the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property and lease commencement. An intangible asset or liability resulting from in-place leases that are above or below the market rental rates are valued based upon our estimates of prevailing market rates for similar leases. Intangible lease assets or liabilities are amortized over the estimated, reasonably assured lease term of the remaining in-place leases as an adjustment to Rental revenues\u201d or Real estate related depreciation and amortization\u201d depending on the nature of the intangible. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.\nIn an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change, as well as other factors, especially in the current global economic environment. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property and quoted market values and third-party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties.\nConsolidation\nWe consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Investments in entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method. Investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, as appropriate. Our ability to correctly assess our influence and/or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations (dollars in thousands)\nOur consolidated results of operations are often not comparable from period to period due to the effect of property acquisitions and dispositions completed during the comparative reporting periods. Our Total Portfolio represents all of the properties owned during the reported periods. To eliminate the effect of changes in our Total Portfolio due to acquisitions, dispositions and other and to highlight the operating results of our on-going business, we have separately presented the results of our Same Store Properties Portfolio and Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we define the Same Store Portfolio as a subset of our Total Portfolio and includes properties that were wholly-owned by us for the entire period presented. We define Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other as any properties that were acquired, sold or held for development or repurposing during the period from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to December 31, 2019\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for our Same Store Portfolio, our acquisitions, dispositions and other and total

$75,290 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to an increase in rental revenue from acquisitions, dispositions and other of $33,230 and an increase of $1,316 from same store properties primarily from an increase in rent income of $1,836 due to scheduled rent steps, leasing activities, and tenant reimbursements and a decrease in non-cash rent adjustments of $520 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nManagement fee revenue: Other revenue represents management fee income earned from the unconsolidated joint venture and other miscellaneous income.\nProperty expenses: Property expenses increased $10,922 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $38,159 as compared to $27,237 for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in expenses related to acquisitions of $10,490. Property expenses for the same store properties increased approximately $432 primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes.\nDepreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $19,047 to approximately $56,428 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $37,381 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase from acquisitions of $21,592 and a decrease of $2,545 for the same store properties due to the full depreciation and amortization of certain assets.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expenses increased approximately $2,881 to $10,362 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $7,481 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is attributable primarily to a net increase in payroll expense of $1,423 due to increased head count and compensation increases, an increase in professional fees of $576, an increase in non-cash stock compensation of $235, and an increase of $307 due to non-cash rent expense from the straight lining of rents.\nInterest expense: Interest expense increased by approximately $3,983 to $18,931 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $14,948 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to additional borrowings associated with our acquisition activity, partially offset by lower interest rates on our line of credit and term loan facility. The schedule below is a comparative analysis of the components of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accrued interest\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>266 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of debt related costs\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,030 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total accretion of interest and deferred interest\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,296 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash interest paid\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,652 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total interest expense\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,948 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment on real estate lease: Change in impairment on real estate lease represents a non-cash impairment against the carrying value of the right of use asset associated with the primary lease of our prior headquarters as discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements.\nUnrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants: Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants represents the change in the fair market value of our common stock warrants. The fair value of warrant derivative adjustment of $103 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $181 for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to an increase in the common stock warrant liability during 2020 and 2019 as discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture: Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture represents our share of earnings/(losses) related to our investment in a unconsolidated joint venture.\nSupplemental Earnings Measures\nInvestors in and industry analysts following the real estate industry utilize supplemental earnings measures such as net operating income ( NOI), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d), funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), core funds from operations ( Core FFO\u201d) and adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d) as supplemental operating performance measures of an equity REIT. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time through depreciation. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors prefer to supplement operating results that use historical cost accounting with measures such as NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, among others. We provide information related to NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO both because such industry analysts are interested in such information, and because our management believes NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are important performance measures. NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are factors used by management in measuring our performance. Neither NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO or AFFO should be considered as a substitute for net income, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Neither NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO or AFFO represents cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and neither should be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, nor is either indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.\nNOI\nWe consider net operating income, or NOI, to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income in that it helps both investors and management understand the core operations of our properties. We define NOI as total revenue (including rental revenue and tenant reimbursements) less property-level operating expenses. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest expense, and other non-operating items.\nThe following is a reconciliation from historical reported net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to NOI:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>NOI: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,462 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,938 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,481 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,948 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment on real estate lease\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>NOI\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,053 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEBITDAre\nWe define earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). EBITDAre represents net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on the sale of rental property, and loss on impairments. We believe that EBITDAre is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company as it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our industrial properties. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our historical net loss to EBITDAre for the periods presented:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>EBITDAre: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,462 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,938 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,948 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>EBITDAre </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFFO\nFunds from operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. In December 2018, NAREIT issued a white paper restating the definition of FFO. The purpose of the restatement was not to change the fundamental definition of FFO, but to clarify existing NAREIT guidance. The restated definition of FFO is as follows: Net Income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding: (i) Depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) Gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, (iii) Gain and losses from change in control, and (iv) Impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity.\nWe define FFO, consistent with the NAREIT definition. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Other equity REITs may not calculate FFO as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. Core FFO represents FFO reduced by dividends paid (or declared) to holders of our preferred stock and excludes certain non-cash operating expenses such as impairment on real estate lease, unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants and loss on extinguishment of debt. As with FFO, our reported Core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' Core FFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of our funds availlable for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our historical net loss to FFO and Core FFO for the periods presented:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FFO: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,462 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,938 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FFO </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,443 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Preferred stock dividends </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,444 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,263 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment on real estate lease </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Core FFO </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,361 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFFO\nAdjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, is presented in addition to Core FFO. AFFO is defined as Core FFO, excluding certain non-cash operating revenues and expenses, acquisition and transaction related costs for transactions not completed and recurring capitalized expenditures. Recurring capitalized expenditures include expenditures required to maintain and re-tenant our properties, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. AFFO further adjusts Core FFO for certain other non-cash items, including the amortization or accretion of above or below market rents included in revenues, straight line rent adjustments, non-cash equity compensation and non-cash interest expense.\nWe believe AFFO provides a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of our properties. As a result, we believe that the use of AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance.\nAs with Core FFO, our reported AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs' AFFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of our funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders to AFFO.\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>AFFO: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Core FFO\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,361 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of debt related costs\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,030 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-cash interest expense\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>266 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock compensation\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Straight line rent\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,963 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,296 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Above/below market lease rents\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,075 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,488 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Recurring capital expenditure (1)\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,263 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,143 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>AFFO\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,935 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Excludes non-recurring capital expenditures of $5,427 and $4,579 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow\nA summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,717 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(259,118 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(200,467 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180,187 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased approximately $14,028 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows from property acquisitions.\nInvesting activities: Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased approximately $58,651 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due an increase in cash paid for acquisitions in 2020 of $246,353 compared to $195,141 in 2019, an increase in real estate improvements of $737, and an increase in investments in a joint venture of $6,702.\nFinancing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased approximately $46,842 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was predominantly driven by an increase of $72,102 in net proceeds from secured and unsecured debt and the line of credit offset by an increase in debt issuance costs of $702, offset by an increase of $416 from the repurchase and extinguishment of Series A Preferred stock, an increase of $5,779 in dividends paid, and a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $18,363.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe intend to make reserve allocations as necessary to aid our objective of preserving capital for our investors by supporting the maintenance and viability of properties we acquire in the future. If reserves and any other available income become insufficient to cover our operating expenses and liabilities, it may be necessary to obtain additional funds by borrowing, refinancing properties or liquidating our investments.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, including:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>property expenses that are not borne by our tenants under our leases; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>principal and interest expense on outstanding indebtedness; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>general and administrative expenses; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>capital expenditures for tenant improvements and leasing commissions. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we will require funds for future dividends required to be paid on our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock.\nWe intend to satisfy our short-term liquidity requirements through our existing cash, cash flow from operating activities and the net proceeds of any potential future offerings.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, future issuances of equity and debt securities, property dispositions and joint venture transactions, and, in connection with acquisitions of additional properties, the issuance of OP units.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create social and economic uncertainty for the Company, its tenants and stakeholders. Given the wide-ranging impacts of the pandemic, coupled with external factors that are outside the control of the Company, the extent of such impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dependent on various future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be readily predicted. The Company continues to monitor potential liquidity restraints resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the evaluation and potential of delayed non-essential capital and operating expenditures that do not impact the safety or ability to lease and/or renew space, and maintaining sufficient availability under our revolving line of credit. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company updated its dividend policy in order to maintain more liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had available liquidity of approximately $114.1 million, comprised of $27.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $86.5 million available on our line of credit. The Company anticipates it will have sufficient liquidity and access to capital resources to meet its current obligations and to meet any scheduled debt maturities.\nVariable interest rates\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. Interest rate exposure relates primarily to the effect of interest rate changes on borrowings outstanding under our borrowing under line of credit and unsecured KeyBank Term Loan, which bear interest at a variable rate.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $190,000 of outstanding variable rate debt, which was subject to a weighted average interest rate of 1.95% during the three months ended December 31, 2020. Based on the variable rate borrowings outstanding during the three months ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that had the average interest rate on our weighted average borrowings increased by 100 basis points for the three months ended December 31, 2020, our interest expense for the quarter would have increased by approximately $326. This estimate assumes the interest rate of each borrowing is raised by 100 basis points. The impact on future interest expense as a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of our borrowings at that time.\nExisting Indebtedness as of December 31, 2020\nThe following is a schedule of our indebtedness as of December 31, 2020 ($ in thousands):\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Outstanding\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest rate at\nDecember 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Final Maturity Date </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Secured debt: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>AIG Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.08% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>November 1, 2023 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transamerica Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.35% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>August 1, 2028 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Allianz Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.07% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 10, 2026 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minnesota Life Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.78% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>May 1, 2028 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>JPMorgan Chase Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 1, 2027 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lincoln Life Mortgage\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.41% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 10, 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ohio National Life Mortgage\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.14% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>August 1, 2024 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nationwide Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.97% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>October 1, 2027 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total secured debt\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>332,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unamortized debt issuance costs, net\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,761 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unamortized premium/(discount), net\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Secured debt, net\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unsecured debt: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>KeyBank Term Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.95%(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> October 8, 2025 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total unsecured debt\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unamortized debt issuance costs, net\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(746 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unsecured debt, net\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unsecured revolving line of credit facility: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Borrowings under line of credit\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.95%(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>October 8, 2024 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Borrowings under line of credit, net\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n(1) The 1-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2020 was 0.14%.

Lease term includes one, twenty year renewal option at a stated rent.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations set forth in the table above, we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers. As approved by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors the agreements provide for base salaries ranging from $325 to $550 annually with discretionary cash performance awards. The agreements contain provisions for equity awards, general benefits, and termination and severance provisions, consistent with similar positions and companies.\nWe also enter into contracts for maintenance and other services at certain properties from time to time.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2020, we have an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture with our ownership percentage at 20%. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, the entity. As a result, we account for this using the equity method of accounting. At December 31, 2020, the aggregate carrying amount of non recourse debt including both our and our partners' share incurred by the joint venture was approximately $56,000 (of which our proportionate share is approximately $11,200). The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of the joint venture properties at December 31, 2020.\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Venture\nOwnership % </td> <td>Stated\nInterest Rate </td> <td>Stated\nPrincipal\nAmount </td> <td>Deferred Financing Costs, Net </td> <td>Carrying Amount </td> <td>Carrying Amount (Our Share) </td> <td>Maturity Date </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Memphis Industrial Portfolio </td> <td>20% </td> <td>3.15% </td> <td> $ 56,000 </td> <td> $ (607) </td> <td> $ 55,393 </td> <td> $ 11,079 </td> <td>1/1/2028 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2019 we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nThe majority of our leases are either triple net or provide for tenant reimbursement for costs related to real estate taxes and operating expenses. In addition, most of the leases provide for fixed rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and tenant payment of taxes and expenses described above. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly known as SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities), requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders' equity. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has no derivative or hedging contracts.\nNo assurance can be given that any future hedging activities by us will have the desired beneficial effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nWe have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that, other than as disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on Form 10-K, such standards will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.", "summary": "- This is a summarized income statement for the year ended December 31, 20X2, and the quarter ended September 30, 20X2, for ABC Company.\n- The company generated $67,274 in

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is based on, and should be read in conjunction with our audited historical financial statements and related notes thereto as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOverview\nWe are a full service, vertically integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT focused on the acquisition, ownership and management of single and multi-tenant industrial properties, including distribution centers, warehouses, light industrial and small bay industrial properties. The Company Portfolio consists of 107 industrial properties located in eleven states with an aggregate of approximately 23.3 million rentable square feet leased to 351 different tenants.\nOur strategy is to acquire, own and manage single and multi-tenant industrial properties located in primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets, with access to large pools of skilled labor in the main industrial, distribution and logistics corridors of the United States. We seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a combination of dividends and capital appreciation.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nBusiness and Strategy\nOur core investment strategy is to acquire industrial properties located in primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets across the U.S. We expect to acquire these properties through third-party purchases and structured sale-leasebacks where we believe we can achieve high initial yields and strong ongoing cash-on-cash returns. In addition, we may make opportunistic acquisitions of industrial properties in primary markets that offer similar return characteristics.\nOur target markets are located in primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets, because we believe these markets tend to have less occupancy and rental rate volatility and less buyer competition relative to gateway markets. We also believe that the systematic aggregation of such properties will result in a diversified portfolio that will produce sustainable risk-adjusted returns. Future results of operations may be affected, either positively or negatively, by our ability to effectively execute this strategy.\nWe also intend to continue pursuing joint venture arrangements with institutional partners which could provide management fee income as well as residual profit-sharing income. Such joint ventures may involve investing in industrial assets that would be characterized as opportunistic or value-add investments. These may involve development or redevelopment strategies that may require significant up-front capital expenditures, lengthy lease-up periods and result in inconsistent cash flows. As such, these properties' risk profiles and return metrics would likely differ from the non-joint venture properties that we target for acquisition.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWhile we are not able to estimate the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating results at this time, the following discussion provides certain information regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and an overview of management's efforts to respond to anticipated impacts. While our results for the year ended December 31, 2020, were in line with our expectations, the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant and wide-ranging efforts of international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities in regions across the United States and the world to combat the spread of the virus, including substantial restrictions on the daily activities of individuals and the operations of many businesses, have significantly reduced economic activity throughout the country and increased volatility in the financial markets, which could negatively impact our results of operations in future periods.\nAs a result of the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment, we expect that such statistical and other information provided below will change, potentially significantly, going forward and may not be indicative of the actual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, cash flows and financial condition for future periods.\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2020, we have collected approximately 98.8% of recurring base rents and tenant recoveries billed for the fourth quarter of 2020; however, collections to-date may not be indicative of collections in any future period. \n \u2022 We have received some rent relief requests from tenants at our properties, most often in the form of rent deferral requests. During the year ended 2020, the Company had entered into a limited number of such COVID-19 related rent deferral concessions representing 1.3% of $94.1 million of annualized base rent ( ABR\u201d). ABR is defined/calculated as the annualized monthly contractual base rent per the leases, excluding any rent abatements, as of December 31, 2020. As of the timing of this filing we have collected all of the deferred rents provided during 2020 and have not provided any additional rent deferrals or other rent concessions. \nIn an effort to stabilize our operations and attempt to manage the impact of COVID-19, we have taken a number of proactive measures to maintain the strength of our business, including the following:\n \u2022 The health and safety of our employees and their families is a top priority. We have adapted our operations to protect employees, including by implementing a work from home policy, and our systems have enabled our team to work seamlessly. \n \u2022 We are in frequent communication with our tenants and we are assisting them in identifying state and federal resources that may be available to support their businesses and employees during the pandemic, including stimulus funds that may be available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020. \n \u2022 We have approximately $27.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $86.5 million available on our line of credit as of December 31, 2020 to address near-term working capital and other liquidity needs. \nRental Revenue\nWe receive income primarily from rental revenue from our properties. The amount of rental revenue generated by the Company Portfolio depends principally on the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, our ability to lease currently available space and space that becomes available as a result of lease expirations and on the rental rates at our properties. The Company Portfolio was approximately 96.4% and 96.6% occupied as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our occupancy rate is impacted by general market conditions in the geographic areas which our properties are located and the financial condition of tenants in our target markets.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and will be affected by economic and competitive conditions in the markets in which we operate and by the desirability of our individual properties. During the period from January 1, 2021 through to December 31, 2022, an aggregate of 33.0% of the annualized base rent leases in the Company Portfolio are scheduled to expire, which we believe will provide us an opportunity to adjust below market rates as market conditions continue to improve.\nThe table below reflects certain data about our new and renewed leases with terms of greater than six months executed in the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe Company Portfolio is located in various primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets, with access to large pools of skilled labor in the main industrial distribution and logistics corridors of the United States. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in these markets are likely to affect our overall performance.\nProperty Expenses\nOur rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and repair and maintenance costs. For the majority of the Company Portfolio, property expenses are controlled, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross lease expense reimbursement provisions in tenant leases. However, the terms of our tenant leases vary and in some instances the leases may provide that we are responsible for certain property expenses. Accordingly, our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property expenses to our tenants.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe expect to incur increased general and administrative expenses, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance and public reporting and compliance. In addition, we anticipate that our staffing levels will increase from current levels as of December 31, 2020 during the subsequent 12 to 24 months and, as a result, our general and administrative expenses will increase further.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our company's historical financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nWe believe our most critical accounting policies are the regular evaluation of whether the value of a real estate asset has been impaired and accounting for acquisitions. Each of these items involves estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature. We collect historical data and current market data, and based on our experience we analyze these assumptions in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes significant estimates regarding the allocation of tangible and intangible assets for real estate acquisitions and impairments of long-lived assets. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. Management adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012 and we believe that our organization and method of operation enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. We had no taxable income prior to electing REIT status. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any tax year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless we are able to obtain relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nWe generally acquire individual properties, and, in some instances, a portfolio of properties. When we acquire individual operating properties with the intention to hold the investment for the long-term, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components typically include land, building, intangible assets related to above and below market leases, value of costs to obtain tenants, and other assumed assets and liabilities, including debt. We consider Level 3 inputs such as the replacement cost of such assets, appraisals, property condition reports, comparable market rental data and other related information in determining the fair value of the tangible assets. The recorded fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities includes Level 3 inputs including the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property and lease commencement. An intangible asset or liability resulting from in-place leases that are above or below the market rental rates are valued based upon our estimates of prevailing market rates for similar leases. Intangible lease assets or liabilities are amortized over the estimated, reasonably assured lease term of the remaining in-place leases as an adjustment to Rental revenues\u201d or Real estate related depreciation and amortization\u201d depending on the nature of the intangible. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.\nIn an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change, as well as other factors, especially in the current global economic environment. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property and quoted market values and third-party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties.\nConsolidation\nWe consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Investments in entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method. Investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, as appropriate. Our ability to correctly assess our influence and/or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations (dollars in thousands)\nOur consolidated results of operations are often not comparable from period to period due to the effect of property acquisitions and dispositions completed during the comparative reporting periods. Our Total Portfolio represents all of the properties owned during the reported periods. To eliminate the effect of changes in our Total Portfolio due to acquisitions, dispositions and other and to highlight the operating results of our on-going business, we have separately presented the results of our Same Store Properties Portfolio and Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we define the Same Store Portfolio as a subset of our Total Portfolio and includes properties that were wholly-owned by us for the entire period presented. We define Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other as any properties that were acquired, sold or held for development or repurposing during the period from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to December 31, 2019\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for our Same Store Portfolio, our acquisitions, dispositions and other and total portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):\n\nRental revenue: Rental revenue increased $34,546 to $109,836 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $75,290 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to an increase in rental revenue from acquisitions, dispositions and other of $33,230 and an increase of $1,316 from same store properties primarily from an increase in rent income of $1,836 due to scheduled rent steps, leasing activities, and tenant reimbursements and a decrease in non-cash rent adjustments of $520 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nManagement fee revenue: Other revenue represents management fee income earned from the unconsolidated joint venture and other miscellaneous income.\nProperty expenses: Property expenses increased $10,922 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $38,159 as compared to $27,237 for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in expenses related to acquisitions of $10,490. Property expenses for the same store properties increased approximately $432 primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes.\nDepreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $19,047 to approximately $56,428 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $37,381 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase from acquisitions of $21,592 and a decrease of $2,545 for the same store properties due to the full depreciation and amortization of certain assets.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expenses increased approximately $2,881 to $10,362 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $7,481 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is attributable primarily to a net increase in payroll expense of $1,423 due to increased head count and compensation increases, an increase in professional fees of $576, an increase in non-cash stock compensation of $235, and an increase of $307 due to non-cash rent expense from the straight lining of rents.\nInterest expense: Interest expense increased by approximately $3,983 to $18,931 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $14,948 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to additional borrowings associated with our acquisition activity, partially offset by lower interest rates on our line of credit and term loan facility. The schedule below is a comparative analysis of the components of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nImpairment on real estate lease: Change in impairment on real estate lease represents a non-cash impairment against the carrying value of the right of use asset associated with the primary lease of our prior headquarters as discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements.\nUnrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants: Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants represents the change in the fair market value of our common stock warrants. The fair value of warrant derivative adjustment of $103 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $181 for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to an increase in the common stock warrant liability during 2020 and 2019 as discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture: Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture represents our share of earnings/(losses) related to our investment in a unconsolidated joint venture.\nSupplemental Earnings Measures\nInvestors in and industry analysts following the real estate industry utilize supplemental earnings measures such as net operating income ( NOI), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d), funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), core funds from operations ( Core FFO\u201d) and adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d) as supplemental operating performance measures of an equity REIT. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time through depreciation. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors prefer to supplement operating results that use historical cost accounting with measures such as NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, among others. We provide information related to NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO both because such industry analysts are interested in such information, and because our management believes NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are important performance measures. NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are factors used by management in measuring our performance. Neither NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO or AFFO should be considered as a substitute for net income, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Neither NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO or AFFO represents cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and neither should be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, nor is either indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.\nNOI\nWe consider net operating income, or NOI, to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income in that it helps both investors and management understand the core operations of our properties. We define NOI as total revenue (including rental revenue and tenant reimbursements) less property-level operating expenses. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest expense, and other non-operating items.\nThe following is a reconciliation from historical reported net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to NOI:\n\nEBITDAre\nWe define earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). EBITDAre represents net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on the sale of rental property, and loss on impairments. We believe that EBITDAre is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company as it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our industrial properties. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our historical net loss to EBITDAre for the periods presented:\n\nFFO\nFunds from operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. In December 2018, NAREIT issued a white paper restating the definition of FFO. The purpose of the restatement was not to change the fundamental definition of FFO, but to clarify existing NAREIT guidance. The restated definition of FFO is as follows: Net Income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding: (i) Depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) Gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, (iii) Gain and losses from change in control, and (iv) Impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity.\nWe define FFO, consistent with the NAREIT definition. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Other equity REITs may not calculate FFO as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. Core FFO represents FFO reduced by dividends paid (or declared) to holders of our preferred stock and excludes certain non-cash operating expenses such as impairment on real estate lease, unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants and loss on extinguishment of debt. As with FFO, our reported Core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' Core FFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of our funds availlable for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our historical net loss to FFO and Core FFO for the periods presented:\n\nAFFO\nAdjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, is presented in addition to Core FFO. AFFO is defined as Core FFO, excluding certain non-cash operating revenues and expenses, acquisition and transaction related costs for transactions not completed and recurring capitalized expenditures. Recurring capitalized expenditures include expenditures required to maintain and re-tenant our properties, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. AFFO further adjusts Core FFO for certain other non-cash items, including the amortization or accretion of above or below market rents included in revenues, straight line rent adjustments, non-cash equity compensation and non-cash interest expense.\nWe believe AFFO provides a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of our properties. As a result, we believe that the use of AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance.\nAs with Core FFO, our reported AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs' AFFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of our funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders to AFFO.\n\n_______________\n (1) Excludes non-recurring capital expenditures of $5,427 and $4,579 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \nCash Flow\nA summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n\nOperating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased approximately $14,028 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows from property acquisitions.\nInvesting activities: Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased approximately $58,651 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due an increase in cash paid for acquisitions in 2020 of $246,353 compared to $195,141 in 2019, an increase in real estate improvements of $737, and an increase in investments in a joint venture of $6,702.\nFinancing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased approximately $46,842 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was predominantly driven by an increase of $72,102 in net proceeds from secured and unsecured debt and the line of credit offset by an increase in debt issuance costs of $702, offset by an increase of $416 from the repurchase and extinguishment of Series A Preferred stock, an increase of $5,779 in dividends paid, and a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $18,363.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe intend to make reserve allocations as necessary to aid our objective of preserving capital for our investors by supporting the maintenance and viability of properties we acquire in the future. If reserves and any other available income become insufficient to cover our operating expenses and liabilities, it may be necessary to obtain additional funds by borrowing, refinancing properties or liquidating our investments.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, including:\n\nIn addition, we will require funds for future dividends required to be paid on our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock.\nWe intend to satisfy our short-term liquidity requirements through our existing cash, cash flow from operating activities and the net proceeds of any potential future offerings.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, future issuances of equity and debt securities, property dispositions and joint venture transactions, and, in connection with acquisitions of additional properties, the issuance of OP units.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create social and economic uncertainty for the Company, its tenants and stakeholders. Given the wide-ranging impacts of the pandemic, coupled with external factors that are outside the control of the Company, the extent of such impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dependent on various future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be readily predicted. The Company continues to monitor potential liquidity restraints resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the evaluation and potential of delayed non-essential capital and operating expenditures that do not impact the safety or ability to lease and/or renew space, and maintaining sufficient availability under our revolving line of credit. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company updated its dividend policy in order to maintain more liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had available liquidity of approximately $114.1 million, comprised of $27.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $86.5 million available on our line of credit. The Company anticipates it will have sufficient liquidity and access to capital resources to meet its current obligations and to meet any scheduled debt maturities.\nVariable interest rates\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. Interest rate exposure relates primarily to the effect of interest rate changes on borrowings outstanding under our borrowing under line of credit and unsecured KeyBank Term Loan, which bear interest at a variable rate.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $190,000 of outstanding variable rate debt, which was subject to a weighted average interest rate of 1.95% during the three months ended December 31, 2020. Based on the variable rate borrowings outstanding during the three months ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that had the average interest rate on our weighted average borrowings increased by 100 basis points for the three months ended December 31, 2020, our interest expense for the quarter would have increased by approximately $326. This estimate assumes the interest rate of each borrowing is raised by 100 basis points. The impact on future interest expense as a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of our borrowings at that time.\nExisting Indebtedness as of December 31, 2020\nThe following is a schedule of our indebtedness as of December 31, 2020 ($ in thousands):\n\n_______________\n(1) The 1-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2020 was 0.14%.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is based on, and should be read in conjunction with our audited historical financial statements and related notes thereto as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOverview\nWe are a full service, vertically integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT focused on the acquisition, ownership and management of single and multi-tenant industrial properties, including distribution centers, warehouses, light industrial and small bay industrial properties. The Company Portfolio consists of 107 industrial properties located in eleven states with an aggregate of approximately 23.3 million rentable square feet leased to 351 different tenants.\nOur strategy is to acquire, own and manage single and multi-tenant industrial properties located in primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets, with access to large pools of skilled labor in the main industrial, distribution and logistics corridors of the United States. We seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a combination of dividends and capital appreciation.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nBusiness and Strategy\nOur core investment strategy is to acquire industrial properties located in primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets across the U.S. We expect to acquire these properties through third-party purchases and structured sale-leasebacks where we believe we can achieve high initial yields and strong ongoing cash-on-cash returns. In addition, we may make opportunistic acquisitions of industrial properties in primary markets that offer similar return characteristics.\nOur target markets are located in primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets, because we believe these markets tend to have less occupancy and rental rate volatility and less buyer competition relative to gateway markets. We also believe that the systematic aggregation of such properties will result in a diversified portfolio that will produce sustainable risk-adjusted returns. Future results of operations may be affected, either positively or negatively, by our ability to effectively execute this strategy.\nWe also intend to continue pursuing joint venture arrangements with institutional partners which could provide management fee income as well as residual profit-sharing income. Such joint ventures may involve investing in industrial assets that would be characterized as opportunistic or value-add investments. These may involve development or redevelopment strategies that may require significant up-front capital expenditures, lengthy lease-up periods and result in inconsistent cash flows. As such, these properties' risk profiles and return metrics would likely differ from the non-joint venture properties that we target for acquisition.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWhile we are not able to estimate the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating results at this time, the following discussion provides certain information regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and an overview of management's efforts to respond to anticipated impacts. While our results for the year ended December 31, 2020, were in line with our expectations, the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant and wide-ranging efforts of international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities in regions across the United States and the world to combat the spread of the virus, including substantial restrictions on the daily activities of individuals and the operations of many businesses, have significantly reduced economic activity throughout the country and increased volatility in the financial markets, which could negatively impact our results of operations in future periods.\nAs a result of the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment, we expect that such statistical and other information provided below will change, potentially significantly, going forward and may not be indicative of the actual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, cash flows and financial condition for future periods.\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2020, we have collected approximately 98.8% of recurring base rents and tenant recoveries billed for the fourth quarter of 2020; however, collections to-date may not be indicative of collections in any future period. \n \u2022 We have received some rent relief requests from tenants at our properties, most often in the form of rent deferral requests. During the year ended 2020, the Company had entered into a limited number of such COVID-19 related rent deferral concessions representing 1.3% of $94.1 million of annualized base rent ( ABR\u201d). ABR is defined/calculated as the annualized monthly contractual base rent per the leases, excluding any rent abatements, as of December 31, 2020. As of the timing of this filing we have collected all of the deferred rents provided during 2020 and have not provided any additional rent deferrals or other rent concessions. \nIn an effort to stabilize our operations and attempt to manage the impact of COVID-19, we have taken a number of proactive measures to maintain the strength of our business, including the following:\n \u2022 The health and safety of our employees and their families is a top priority. We have adapted our operations to protect employees, including by implementing a work from home policy, and our systems have enabled our team to work seamlessly. \n \u2022 We are in frequent communication with our tenants and we are assisting them in identifying state and federal resources that may be available to support their businesses and employees during the pandemic, including stimulus funds that may be available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020. \n \u2022 We have approximately $27.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $86.5 million available on our line of credit as of December 31, 2020 to address near-term working capital and other liquidity needs. \nRental Revenue\nWe receive income primarily from rental revenue from our properties. The amount of rental revenue generated by the Company Portfolio depends principally on the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, our ability to lease currently available space and space that becomes available as a result of lease expirations and on the rental rates at our properties. The Company Portfolio was approximately 96.4% and 96.6% occupied as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our occupancy rate is impacted by general market conditions in the geographic areas which our properties are located and the financial condition of tenants in our target markets.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and will be affected by economic and competitive conditions in the markets in which we operate and by the desirability of our individual properties. During the period from January 1, 2021 through to December 31, 2022, an aggregate of 33.0% of the annualized base rent leases in the Company Portfolio are scheduled to expire, which we believe will provide us an opportunity to adjust below market rates as market conditions continue to improve.\nThe table below reflects certain data about our new and renewed leases with terms of greater than six months executed in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Square\nFootage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Square Footage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Expiring Rent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>New Rent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Tenant Improvements $/SF/YR </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Lease Commissions $/SF/YR </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Renewals </td> <td> </td> <td>1,881,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>New Leases </td> <td> </td> <td>764,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.9% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2,645,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe Company Portfolio is located in various primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets, with access to large pools of skilled labor in the main industrial distribution and logistics corridors of the United States. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in these markets are likely to affect our overall performance.\nProperty Expenses\nOur rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and repair and maintenance costs. For the majority of the Company Portfolio, property expenses are controlled, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross lease expense reimbursement provisions in tenant leases. However, the terms of our tenant leases vary and in some instances the leases may provide that we are responsible for certain property expenses. Accordingly, our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property expenses to our tenants.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe expect to incur increased general and administrative expenses, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance and public reporting and compliance. In addition, we anticipate that our staffing levels will increase from current levels as of December 31, 2020 during the subsequent 12 to 24 months and, as a result, our general and administrative expenses will increase further.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our company's historical financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nWe believe our most critical accounting policies are the regular evaluation of whether the value of a real estate asset has been impaired and accounting for acquisitions. Each of these items involves estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature. We collect historical data and current market data, and based on our experience we analyze these assumptions in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes significant estimates regarding the allocation of tangible and intangible assets for real estate acquisitions and impairments of long-lived assets. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. Management adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012 and we believe that our organization and method of operation enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. We had no taxable income prior to electing REIT status. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any tax year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless we are able to obtain relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nWe generally acquire individual properties, and, in some instances, a portfolio of properties. When we acquire individual operating properties with the intention to hold the investment for the long-term, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components typically include land, building, intangible assets related to above and below market leases, value of costs to obtain tenants, and other assumed assets and liabilities, including debt. We consider Level 3 inputs such as the replacement cost of such assets, appraisals, property condition reports, comparable market rental data and other related information in determining the fair value of the tangible assets. The recorded fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities includes Level 3 inputs including the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property and lease commencement. An intangible asset or liability resulting from in-place leases that are above or below the market rental rates are valued based upon our estimates of prevailing market rates for similar leases. Intangible lease assets or liabilities are amortized over the estimated, reasonably assured lease term of the remaining in-place leases as an adjustment to Rental revenues\u201d or Real estate related depreciation and amortization\u201d depending on the nature of the intangible. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.\nIn an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change, as well as other factors, especially in the current global economic environment. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property and quoted market values and third-party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties.\nConsolidation\nWe consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Investments in entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method. Investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, as appropriate. Our ability to correctly assess our influence and/or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations (dollars in thousands)\nOur consolidated results of operations are often not comparable from period to period due to the effect of property acquisitions and dispositions completed during the comparative reporting periods. Our Total Portfolio represents all of the properties owned during the reported periods. To eliminate the effect of changes in our Total Portfolio due to acquisitions, dispositions and other and to highlight the operating results of our on-going business, we have separately presented the results of our Same Store Properties Portfolio and Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we define the Same Store Portfolio as a subset of our Total Portfolio and includes properties that were wholly-owned by us for the entire period presented. We define Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other as any properties that were acquired, sold or held for development or repurposing during the period from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to December 31, 2019\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for our Same Store Portfolio, our acquisitions, dispositions and other and total

$75,290 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to an increase in rental revenue from acquisitions, dispositions and other of $33,230 and an increase of $1,316 from same store properties primarily from an increase in rent income of $1,836 due to scheduled rent steps, leasing activities, and tenant reimbursements and a decrease in non-cash rent adjustments of $520 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nManagement fee revenue: Other revenue represents management fee income earned from the unconsolidated joint venture and other miscellaneous income.\nProperty expenses: Property expenses increased $10,922 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $38,159 as compared to $27,237 for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in expenses related to acquisitions of $10,490. Property expenses for the same store properties increased approximately $432 primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes.\nDepreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $19,047 to approximately $56,428 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $37,381 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase from acquisitions of $21,592 and a decrease of $2,545 for the same store properties due to the full depreciation and amortization of certain assets.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expenses increased approximately $2,881 to $10,362 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $7,481 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is attributable primarily to a net increase in payroll expense of $1,423 due to increased head count and compensation increases, an increase in professional fees of $576, an increase in non-cash stock compensation of $235, and an increase of $307 due to non-cash rent expense from the straight lining of rents.\nInterest expense: Interest expense increased by approximately $3,983 to $18,931 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $14,948 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to additional borrowings associated with our acquisition activity, partially offset by lower interest rates on our line of credit and term loan facility. The schedule below is a comparative analysis of the components of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accrued interest\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>266 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of debt related costs\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,030 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total accretion of interest and deferred interest\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,296 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash interest paid\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,652 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total interest expense\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,948 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment on real estate lease: Change in impairment on real estate lease represents a non-cash impairment against the carrying value of the right of use asset associated with the primary lease of our prior headquarters as discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements.\nUnrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants: Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants represents the change in the fair market value of our common stock warrants. The fair value of warrant derivative adjustment of $103 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $181 for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to an increase in the common stock warrant liability during 2020 and 2019 as discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture: Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture represents our share of earnings/(losses) related to our investment in a unconsolidated joint venture.\nSupplemental Earnings Measures\nInvestors in and industry analysts following the real estate industry utilize supplemental earnings measures such as net operating income ( NOI), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d), funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), core funds from operations ( Core FFO\u201d) and adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d) as supplemental operating performance measures of an equity REIT. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time through depreciation. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors prefer to supplement operating results that use historical cost accounting with measures such as NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, among others. We provide information related to NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO both because such industry analysts are interested in such information, and because our management believes NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are important performance measures. NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are factors used by management in measuring our performance. Neither NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO or AFFO should be considered as a substitute for net income, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Neither NOI, EBITDAre, FFO, Core FFO or AFFO represents cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and neither should be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, nor is either indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.\nNOI\nWe consider net operating income, or NOI, to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income in that it helps both investors and management understand the core operations of our properties. We define NOI as total revenue (including rental revenue and tenant reimbursements) less property-level operating expenses. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest expense, and other non-operating items.\nThe following is a reconciliation from historical reported net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to NOI:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>NOI: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,462 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,938 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,481 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,948 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment on real estate lease\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>NOI\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,053 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEBITDAre\nWe define earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). EBITDAre represents net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on the sale of rental property, and loss on impairments. We believe that EBITDAre is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company as it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our industrial properties. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our historical net loss to EBITDAre for the periods presented:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>EBITDAre: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,462 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,938 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,948 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>EBITDAre </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFFO\nFunds from operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. In December 2018, NAREIT issued a white paper restating the definition of FFO. The purpose of the restatement was not to change the fundamental definition of FFO, but to clarify existing NAREIT guidance. The restated definition of FFO is as follows: Net Income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding: (i) Depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) Gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, (iii) Gain and losses from change in control, and (iv) Impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity.\nWe define FFO, consistent with the NAREIT definition. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Other equity REITs may not calculate FFO as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. Core FFO represents FFO reduced by dividends paid (or declared) to holders of our preferred stock and excludes certain non-cash operating expenses such as impairment on real estate lease, unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants and loss on extinguishment of debt. As with FFO, our reported Core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' Core FFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of our funds availlable for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our historical net loss to FFO and Core FFO for the periods presented:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FFO: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,462 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,938 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FFO </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,443 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Preferred stock dividends </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,444 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,263 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) of warrants </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment on real estate lease </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Core FFO </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,361 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFFO\nAdjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, is presented in addition to Core FFO. AFFO is defined as Core FFO, excluding certain non-cash operating revenues and expenses, acquisition and transaction related costs for transactions not completed and recurring capitalized expenditures. Recurring capitalized expenditures include expenditures required to maintain and re-tenant our properties, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. AFFO further adjusts Core FFO for certain other non-cash items, including the amortization or accretion of above or below market rents included in revenues, straight line rent adjustments, non-cash equity compensation and non-cash interest expense.\nWe believe AFFO provides a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of our properties. As a result, we believe that the use of AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance.\nAs with Core FFO, our reported AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs' AFFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of our funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders to AFFO.\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>AFFO: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Core FFO\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,361 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of debt related costs\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,030 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-cash interest expense\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>266 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock compensation\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Straight line rent\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,963 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,296 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Above/below market lease rents\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,075 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,488 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Recurring capital expenditure (1)\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,263 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,143 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>AFFO\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,935 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n (1) Excludes non-recurring capital expenditures of $5,427 and $4,579 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \nCash Flow\nA summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,717 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(259,118 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(200,467 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180,187 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased approximately $14,028 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows from property acquisitions.\nInvesting activities: Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased approximately $58,651 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due an increase in cash paid for acquisitions in 2020 of $246,353 compared to $195,141 in 2019, an increase in real estate improvements of $737, and an increase in investments in a joint venture of $6,702.\nFinancing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased approximately $46,842 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was predominantly driven by an increase of $72,102 in net proceeds from secured and unsecured debt and the line of credit offset by an increase in debt issuance costs of $702, offset by an increase of $416 from the repurchase and extinguishment of Series A Preferred stock, an increase of $5,779 in dividends paid, and a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $18,363.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe intend to make reserve allocations as necessary to aid our objective of preserving capital for our investors by supporting the maintenance and viability of properties we acquire in the future. If reserves and any other available income become insufficient to cover our operating expenses and liabilities, it may be necessary to obtain additional funds by borrowing, refinancing properties or liquidating our investments.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, including:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>property expenses that are not borne by our tenants under our leases; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>principal and interest expense on outstanding indebtedness; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>general and administrative expenses; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>capital expenditures for tenant improvements and leasing commissions. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we will require funds for future dividends required to be paid on our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock.\nWe intend to satisfy our short-term liquidity requirements through our existing cash, cash flow from operating activities and the net proceeds of any potential future offerings.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, future issuances of equity and debt securities, property dispositions and joint venture transactions, and, in connection with acquisitions of additional properties, the issuance of OP units.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create social and economic uncertainty for the Company, its tenants and stakeholders. Given the wide-ranging impacts of the pandemic, coupled with external factors that are outside the control of the Company, the extent of such impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dependent on various future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be readily predicted. The Company continues to monitor potential liquidity restraints resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the evaluation and potential of delayed non-essential capital and operating expenditures that do not impact the safety or ability to lease and/or renew space, and maintaining sufficient availability under our revolving line of credit. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company updated its dividend policy in order to maintain more liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had available liquidity of approximately $114.1 million, comprised of $27.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $86.5 million available on our line of credit. The Company anticipates it will have sufficient liquidity and access to capital resources to meet its current obligations and to meet any scheduled debt maturities.\nVariable interest rates\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. Interest rate exposure relates primarily to the effect of interest rate changes on borrowings outstanding under our borrowing under line of credit and unsecured KeyBank Term Loan, which bear interest at a variable rate.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $190,000 of outstanding variable rate debt, which was subject to a weighted average interest rate of 1.95% during the three months ended December 31, 2020. Based on the variable rate borrowings outstanding during the three months ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that had the average interest rate on our weighted average borrowings increased by 100 basis points for the three months ended December 31, 2020, our interest expense for the quarter would have increased by approximately $326. This estimate assumes the interest rate of each borrowing is raised by 100 basis points. The impact on future interest expense as a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of our borrowings at that time.\nExisting Indebtedness as of December 31, 2020\nThe following is a schedule of our indebtedness as of December 31, 2020 ($ in thousands):\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Outstanding\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest rate at\nDecember 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Final Maturity Date </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Secured debt: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>AIG Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.08% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>November 1, 2023 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transamerica Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.35% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>August 1, 2028 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Allianz Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.07% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 10, 2026 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minnesota Life Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.78% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>May 1, 2028 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>JPMorgan Chase Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 1, 2027 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lincoln Life Mortgage\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.41% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 10, 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ohio National Life Mortgage\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.14% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>August 1, 2024 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nationwide Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.97% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>October 1, 2027 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total secured debt\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>332,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unamortized debt issuance costs, net\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,761 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unamortized premium/(discount), net\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Secured debt, net\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unsecured debt: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>KeyBank Term Loan\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.95%(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> October 8, 2025 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total unsecured debt\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unamortized debt issuance costs, net\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(746 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unsecured debt, net\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unsecured revolving line of credit facility: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Borrowings under line of credit\t </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.95%(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>October 8, 2024 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Borrowings under line of credit, net\t </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n(1) The 1-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2020 was 0.14%.
