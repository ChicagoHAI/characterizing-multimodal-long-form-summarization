Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In this report, we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Terra Income Fund 6, Inc.\nPlease see Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on May 15, 2013 and commenced operations on June 24, 2015, upon the raising of gross proceeds in excess of the Minimum Offering Requirement. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, and have elected to be taxed for federal income tax purposes, beginning with our taxable year ended September 30, 2015, and to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Prior to satisfying the Minimum Offering Requirement, we have no operations except for matters relating to our organization and registration.\nOur investment activities are externally managed by Terra Income Advisors and supervised by the Board, a majority of whom are independent. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay Terra Income Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average quarterly gross assets, as well as incentive fees based on our performance. (See Related Party Transactions).\nAlso, we have agreed to pay selling commissions, broker-dealer fees, a dealer manager fee and distribution fees, and to reimburse Terra Income Advisors for our organization and offering expenses up to a maximum amount equal to 1.5% of the gross proceeds from the Offering. Terra Income Advisors will bear all organization and offering expenses in excess of this amount.\nOur primary investment objectives are to pay attractive and stable cash distributions and to preserve, protect and return capital contributions to stockholders. Our investment strategy is to use substantially all of the proceeds of the Offering to originate and manage a diversified portfolio consisting of (i) commercial real estate loans to U.S. companies qualifying as eligible portfolio companies\u201d under the 1940 Act, including mezzanine loans, first and second lien mortgage loans, subordinated mortgage loans, bridge loans and other commercial real estate-related loans related to or secured by high quality commercial real estate in the United States and (ii) preferred equity real estate investments in U.S. companies qualifying as eligible portfolio companies\u201d under the 1940 Act. We may also purchase select commercial real estate-related debt securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities or collateralized debt obligations; provided, however, that we will select all investments after considering our ability to qualify to be taxed as a RIC.\nThe level of our investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to prospective borrowers, the level of refinancing activity for such companies, the availability of credit to finance transactions, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. Based on prevailing market conditions exclusive of the restrictions imposed by the RIC diversification requirement, we anticipate that we will invest the proceeds from each subscription closing generally within 90 days of such closing. The precise timing will depend on the availability of investment opportunities that are consistent with our investment objective and strategies. Any distributions we make prior to the time that all capital raised has been deployed may be substantially lower than the distributions that we expect to pay when our portfolio is fully invested.\nOur management is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, which may reasonably be anticipated to have a material impact on the capital resources and the revenue or income to be derived from our assets.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest on the debt securities that we hold. We make debt investments that bear interest at fixed and floating rates. Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of exit fees payable upon repayment of the loans we hold, origination fees for loans we originate, commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Preferred returns earned on any preferred equity investments, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include interest expense from obligations under participation agreements, amortization of deferred offering costs, professional fees, marketing expenses, payment of adviser fees and reimbursement of expenses to Terra Income Advisors and other expenses necessary for our operations. We bear other expenses, which include, among other things:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>corporate, organizational and offering expenses relating to offerings of our common stock, subject to limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cost of calculating our NAV, including the related fees and cost of any third-party valuation services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, monitoring our financial and legal affairs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>transfer agent and custodial fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>distribution fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>federal and state registration fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>federal, state and local taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>independent directors' fees and expenses, including travel expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of director and stockholder meetings, proxy statements, stockholders' reports and notices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of fidelity bonds, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>direct costs, including those relating to printing of stockholder reports and advertising or sales materials, mailing and long distance telephone expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs associated with our chief compliance officer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>brokerage commissions for our investments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>all other expenses incurred by us or Terra Income Advisors in connection with administering our investment portfolio, including expenses incurred by Terra Income Advisors in performing certain of its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We reimburse Terra Income Advisors for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operation. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (i) Terra Income Advisors' actual costs incurred in providing such services and (ii) the amount that the Board, including a majority of our independent directors, estimates we would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. Terra Income Advisors is required to allocate the cost of such services to us based on objective factors, such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Board then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party providers known to be available. In addition, the Board considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Board compares the total amount paid to Terra Income Advisors for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse Terra Income Advisors for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of Terra Income Advisors.\nNet Investment Portfolio\nThe tables below present our investment portfolio on a net investment basis, which represents our proportionate share of the investments, based on our economic ownership of these investments. This measure is used in reports to our executive management and is used as a component to the asset base from which we calculate our base management fee. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it represents our total assets under management and the financial exposure of each investment individually.\nTable 111:

enter into participation agreements with related and unrelated parties, primarily other affiliated funds of our sponsor. The purpose of the participation agreements is to allow us and an affiliate to originate a specified investment when, individually, we do not have the liquidity to do so or to achieve a certain level of portfolio diversification. We may transfer portions of our investments to other participants or we may be a participant to an investment held by another entity.\nCertain partial loan sales do not qualify for sale accounting under Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 860 -\nTransfers and Servicing ( ASC Topic 860\u201d) because these sales do not meet the definition of a participating interest,\u201d as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain as an investment on the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities and the portion transferred is recorded as obligations under participation agreements in the liabilities section of the statements of assets and liabilities.\nAs of September 30, 2016, obligations under participation agreements at fair value totaled approximately $14.6 million and the fair value of the loans that are associated with these obligations under participation agreements was approximately $21.2 million. As of September 30, 2015, we did not have any obligations under participation agreements. For the year ended September 30, 2016, there were no repayments on obligations under participation agreements. The weighted average interest rate on our obligations under participation agreements was approximately 13.9% as of September 30, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nWe were formed on May 15, 2013, and commenced operations on June 24, 2015.

The increase in total investment income for both the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 over the same period in the respective prior year was primarily due to our commencement of operations on of June 24, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nThe composition of our operating expenses for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense from obligations under participation agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,598,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred offering costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,312,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>981,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>876,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>596,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>552,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense reimbursement to Adviser\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>318,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>219,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Directors' fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive fees on capital gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organization expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,049,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,750,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Expense reimbursement from Adviser\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(576,755\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,690,300\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,472,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary operating expenses include interest expense from obligations under participation agreements, amortization of deferred offering costs, professional fees, marketing expenses, which include the costs of educational and training seminars and other marketing related expenses, base management fees, operating expense reimbursement to Adviser, insurance expense and directors' fees. Operating expense reimbursement to Adviser include reimbursements to Terra Income Advisors for operating expenses incurred in connection with administrative services provided to us, including compensation to administrative personnel.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses was approximately $6.0 million, compared to approximately $1.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2015 and approximately $0.03 million for the year ended September 30, 2014. The increase in total operating expense for both the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 over the same period in the respective prior year was primarily due to our commencement of operations on June 24, 2015. In addition, for the year ended September 30,\n2016, we transferred a portion of two investments to an affiliated fund which resulted in total interest expense from obligations under participation agreements of approximately $1.6 million.\nExpense Support and Reimbursement Agreement\nOn June 30, 2015, we entered into an expense support agreement (the Expense Support Agreement\u201d) with Terra Income Advisors, whereby Terra Income Advisors may pay up to 100% of our costs and expenses for any period since inception, including all fees payable to the advisor pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, until we and Terra Income Advisors mutually agree otherwise. This payment (the Expense Support Payment\u201d) for any month shall be paid by Terra Income Advisors to us in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds, and/or offsets against amounts due from us to Terra Income Advisors. The purpose of the Expense Support Payment is to reduce offering and operating expenses until we have achieved economies of scale sufficient to ensure that we are able to bear a reasonable level of expense in relation to investment income. Operating expenses subject to the Expense Support Agreement include expenses as determined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), including, without limitation, fees payable to Terra Income Advisors and interest on indebtedness for such period, if any.\nPursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse Terra Income Advisors for each Expense Support Payment within three years after such Expense Support Payment is made by Terra Income Advisors. Reimbursement shall be made as promptly as possible on a date mutually agreed to by us and Terra Income Advisors (provided that (i) the operating expense ratio, defined as operating expenses excluding organization and offering expenses, base management fees, incentive fees and any interest expense attributable to indebtedness by us ( Net Operating Expenses\u201d) expressed as a percentage of our net assets on the relevant measurement date, as of such reimbursement date is equal to or less than the operating expense ratio as of the Expense Support Payment date attributable to such specified Expense Support Payment, (ii) the annualized distribution rate as of such reimbursement date is equal to or greater than the annualized distribution rate as of the Expense Support Payment date attributable to such specified Expense Support Payment; (iii) such reimbursement date is not later than three years following such specified Expense Support Payment date; and (iv) the Expense Support Payment does not cause our Net Operating Expenses to exceed 1.5% of our net assets attributable to common shares, after taking such reimbursement into account. Terra Income Advisors is entitled to reimbursement of all previously unreimbursed Expense Support Payments in the event of termination of the Expense Support Agreement.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized expense reimbursements made by Terra Income Advisors of approximately $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, which are included in the statements of operations. For the year ended September 30, 2014, we did not record any expense reimbursement payments.\nNet Increase in Unrealized Appreciation on Investments and Obligations under Participation Agreements\nNet increase in unrealized appreciation on investments and obligations under participation agreements reflects the change in our portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses, when gains or losses are realized. Valuation of our portfolio investments fluctuates over time, reflecting changes in the market yields for loans and debt investments, and any associated premium or discount will be amortized down or accreted up to par value as each investment approaches maturity.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, net increase in unrealized appreciation on investments was approximately $0.2 million and net increase in unrealized appreciation on obligations under participation agreements was approximately $0.1 million. For the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, there was no change in unrealized appreciation on our investments or obligations under participation agreements. The net increase in unrealized appreciation on our investments and obligations under participation agreements for the year ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to our commencement of operations on June 24, 2015, which increased our investments in the portfolio for the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year.\nNet (Decrease) Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a net (decrease) increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $(2.3) million, $0.01 million and $(0.03) million, respectively. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the year ended September 30, 2016 and from June 24, 2015, the commencement of operations, to September 30, 2015, our per share net (decrease) increase in net assets resulting from operations was $(0.93) and $0.01, respectively.\nCapital Contribution from Terra Capital Partners\nPursuant to an initial capitalization and subsequent private placement, Terra Capital Partners had purchased an aggregate of $175,000 of shares of our common stock at $11.25 per share, which price represented the initial public offering price of $12.50 per share, net of selling commissions, broker-dealer fees and dealer manager fees. On February 25, 2015, the Board determined to change the initial offering price from $10.00 per share to $12.50 per share. As a result, on February 26, 2015, we effected a reverse stock split to account for the change in our offering price since the initial investment by Terra Capital Partners. As such, all share references and equity transaction pricing elsewhere reflect this reverse stock split. On May 1, 2015, Terra Capital Partners\nalso purchased an additional $275,000 of shares of our common stock from the Offering at $11.25 per share, also net of selling commissions, broker-dealer fees and dealer manager fees from the current offering price of $12.50 per share. As a result, gross offering proceeds of $450,000 are immediately available to us. The gross offering proceeds from Terra Capital Partners' capital contributions have been included for purposes of determining our satisfaction of the Minimum Offering Requirement.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe currently generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of the Offering and from cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. Our primary use of cash is for our targeted investments, payments of our expenses and cash distributions to our stockholders. We sell our shares on a continuous basis at a per share price of $12.50. However, to the extent that our NAV per share increases to an amount greater than our net proceeds as stated in our prospectus dated April 27, 2016, we will sell at a price necessary to ensure that our shares are not sold at a price, after deduction of selling commissions, broker-dealer fees and dealer manager fees, that is below NAV per share. On November 11, 2015, and effective as December 1, 2015, the Board approved a change to a certain aspect of our share pricing policy such that, once we have raised gross offering proceeds in excess of $125 million, or prior to then in the sole discretion of our Board, in the event of a material decline in our NAV per share, which we consider to be a 2.5% decrease below our then-current net offering price, we will reduce our offering price to establish a new net offering price not more than 2.5% above our NAV per share.\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we will invest the net proceeds from the Offering and from sales and paydowns of existing investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our intended BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nWe may borrow funds to make investments, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of our continuous offering, to the extent we determine that leveraging our portfolio would be appropriate. We have not decided whether, and to what extent, we will finance portfolio investments using debt or the specific form that any such financing would take. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty what terms any such financing would have or the costs we would incur in connection with any such arrangement. We currently do not anticipate issuing any preferred stock; however, our charter authorizes us to do so.\nOur principal demands for funds are for portfolio investments, either directly or through investment interests, for the payment of operating expenses, distributions to our investors and for the payment of principal and interest on any outstanding indebtedness we may acquire. Generally, cash needs for investment activities will be met through proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through the Offering. Management expects that in the future, as our investment portfolio grows, our investments will generate sufficient cash flow to cover operating expenses and the payment of a monthly distribution.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended September 30, 2016\nOperating Activities - For the year ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was approximately $13.4 million. The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of purchases, redemptions and sales of portfolio investments, among other factors. Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2016 were primarily purchases of investments totaling approximately $26.3 million, partially offset by net proceeds from obligations under participation agreements of approximately $14.3 million.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $36.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of common stock of approximately $39.9 million and reimbursement of approximately $1.3 million from Terra Capital Markets for commissions and dealer manager fees we paid related to shares sold prior to February 20, 2016 (see Contractual Obligations\u201d below), partially offset by payments of selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution fees of approximately $2.8 million and distributions paid to shareholders of approximately $1.6 million.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended September 30, 2015\nOperating Activities - For the year ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was approximately $2.0 million, primarily due to a purchase of an investment for approximately $2.0 million. The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of purchases, redemptions and sales of portfolio investments, among other factors.\nFinancing Activities - Cash flows provided by financing activities was approximately $10.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, primarily related to proceeds from issuance of common stock of approximately $11.2 million, partially offset by payments of selling commissions and dealer manager fees of approximately $0.9 million and distributions paid to shareholders of approximately $0.1 million.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended September 30, 2014\nFinancing Activities - Cash flows provided by financing activities was approximately $0.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2014, representing Terra Capital Partners' initial capital contribution to us.\nRIC Status and Distributions\nWe have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes and to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute at least 90.0% of our investment company taxable income,\u201d as defined by the Code, each year. As long as the distributions are declared by the later of the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of the taxable year or the due date of the tax return, including extensions, distributions paid up to one year after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for determining the distributions paid in such tax year. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to qualify for and maintain our RIC status each year. We are also subject to nondeductible federal excise taxes if we do not distribute at least 98.0% of net ordinary income, 98.2% of any capital gain net income, if any, and any recognized and undistributed income from prior years on which we paid no federal income taxes.\nDistributions to our stockholders are recorded as of the record date. Subject to the discretion of the Board and applicable legal restrictions, we authorize and declare ordinary cash distributions on either a monthly or quarterly basis and pay such distributions on a monthly basis. We calculate each stockholder's specific distribution amount for the period using daily record dates, and each stockholder's distributions begin to accrue on the date we accept such stockholder's subscription for shares of our common stock. From time to time at the discretion of the Board, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or shares of common stock.\nDuring certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from the Offering of our common stock. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make will represent a return of capital for tax purposes. A return of capital generally is a return of an investor's investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with the Offering, including any fees payable to Terra Income Advisors. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our stockholders.\nWe intend to continue to make our ordinary distributions in the form of cash out of assets legally available for distribution, unless stockholders elect to receive their cash distributions in additional shares of our common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. stockholder.\nWe have adopted an opt in\u201d distribution reinvestment plan for our stockholders. As a result, if we make a cash distribution, our stockholders will receive distributions in cash unless they specifically opt in\u201d to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. However, certain state authorities or regulators may impose restrictions from time to time that may prevent or limit a stockholder's ability to participate in the distribution reinvestment plan.\nWe may fund our cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds available to us, including offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make distributions.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As we execute our expected operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.\nValuation of Investments\nWe measure the value of our investments in accordance with fair value accounting guidance promulgated under U.S. GAAP, which establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework that prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring investments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily available actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices, generally, will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value.\nInvestments measured and reported at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1 - observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets. Publicly listed equities and publicly listed derivatives will be included in Level 1. In addition, securities sold, but not yet purchased, and call options will be included in Level 1.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2 - observable inputs such as for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities in markets that are not active. In certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices, market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. Investments which are generally expected to be included in this category include corporate bonds and loans, convertible debt indexed to publicly listed securities and certain over-the-counter derivatives.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3 - unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the investment. We expect most of the investments that will be held in the investment portfolio to fall into Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nValuation of Obligations under Participation Agreements\nWe have elected the fair value option under ASC Topic 825 - Financial Instruments relating to accounting for debt obligations at their fair value for obligations under participation agreements which arose due to partial loan sales which did not meet the criteria for sale treatment under ASC Topic 860. We employ the yield approach valuation methodology used for the real-estate related loan investments on our obligations under participation agreements. As of September 30, 2016, obligations under participation agreements at fair value totaled approximately $14.6 million and the fair value of the loans that are associated with these obligations under participation agreements is approximately $21.2 million. For the year ended September 30, 2016, there were no repayments on obligations under participation agreements. The weighted average interest rate on our obligations under participation agreements was approximately 13.9% as of September 30, 2016.\nRevenue Recognition\nSecurity transactions are accounted for on their trade date. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. We do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if there is reason to doubt the collectability of such income. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and such amounts are amortized into interest income as a yield adjustment using the effective interest method over the respective term of the loan. Upon the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and securities as interest income when we receive such amounts.\nOrganization Costs\nOrganization costs include, among other things, the cost of incorporating, including the cost of legal services and other fees pertaining to our organization. These costs are expensed as incurred. For the period from May 15, 2013 (inception) to September 30, 2016, we incurred cumulative organization costs totaling approximately $0.2 million, which were paid on behalf of us by Terra Income Advisors and have been recorded as a payable to it. For the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, we incurred approximately $0.1 million and $0.03 million of organization costs, respectively. We did not incur any organization costs for the year ended September 30, 2016.\nOffering Costs\nOur offering costs include, among other things, legal and printing costs pertaining to preparation of the initial registration statement and prospectus and registration fees relating to the Offering. All offering costs incurred during the offering period are\nrecorded as deferred charge and amortized over twelve months from the date the cost is incurred, with the exception of those costs that were incurred prior to the commencement of operations on June 24, 2015, which were amortized over a twelve month period from that date forward. For the period from our inception on May 15, 2013 to September 30, 2016, we incurred cumulative offering costs totaling approximately $2.2 million. For the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded approximately $1.3 million and $0.4 million of amortization of deferred offering costs, respectively.\nIncentive Fee on Capital Gains\nPursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee on capital gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of our incentive fee on capital gains, which equals the realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue (but do not pay) for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period. While the Investment Advisory Agreement neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we accrue for this incentive fee to include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to Terra Income Advisors if our entire portfolio were liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though Terra Income Advisors is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.\nFederal Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be taxed for federal income tax purposes, and to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders from our earnings and profits as determined for federal income tax purposes. To obtain and maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute annually at least 90.0% of our ordinary net income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any.\nRecognition of a tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax liabilities as income tax expense in the statement of operations. For the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not incur any interest or penalties.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. On April 20, 2015, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Terra Income Advisors in accordance with the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement became effective on June 24, 2015, the date that we met the Minimum Offering Requirement. Terra Income Advisors serves as our investment adviser in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Payments under the Investment Advisory Agreement in each reporting period will consist of (i) a base management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our average gross assets and (ii) an incentive fee based on our performance. Terra Income Advisors will be reimbursed for allocated administrative expenses incurred on our behalf. For the year ended September 30, 2016 and for the period from our commencement of operations on June 24, 2015 through September 30, 2015, we incurred approximately $0.6 million and $0.03 million, respectively, in base management fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. For the year ended September 30, 2016, we accrued incentive fees on capital gains of approximately $0.03 million, based on net unrealized capital gains of approximately $0.1 million. No incentive fees on capital gains are actually payable by us with respect to unrealized gains unless and until those gains are actually realized. There were no such fees for the year ended September 30, 2015.\nOn April 20, 2015, we entered into a dealer manager agreement (the Dealer Manager Agreement\u201d) with Terra Capital Markets, an affiliate of Terra Income Advisors, to serve as the dealer manager of the Offering. As dealer manager, Terra Capital Markets is responsible for marketing our shares being offered pursuant to the Offering. In this role, it will manage a group of selling dealers, including other unaffiliated broker-dealers who enter into Selected Dealer Arrangements with Terra Capital Markets. Terra Capital Markets received selling commissions, dealer manager fees and broker-dealer fees of 6.0%, 3.0% and 1.0%, respectively, of gross proceeds from the Offering, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers for marketing and expenses.\nOn April 19, 2016, the Board approved an amended and restated dealer manager agreement (the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement\u201d), which we adopted on April 27, 2016. Under the terms of the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, Terra Capital Markets receives selling commissions, dealer manager fees and broker-dealer fees of 3.0%, 1.5% and 1.0%, respectively, of gross proceeds from the Offering, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers for marketing and expenses. In addition, Terra Capital Markets receives a distribution fee at an annual rate of 1.125% of gross offering proceeds, excluding shares sold through the distribution reinvestment plan, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers for\nservices performed in connection with the distribution of our shares. The distribution fee is payable annually with respect to each share sold in the primary offering on the first, second, third, and fourth anniversaries of the month of purchase. In connection with the adoption of the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, Terra Capital Markets reimbursed us approximately $1.3 million for selling commissions and dealer manager fees we paid related to the shares sold on and prior to February 20, 2016, the last shareholder admittance date prior to the adoption of the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement. The reimbursement amount will be paid back to Terra Capital Markets on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the months of purchase.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately $3.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of broker-dealer commissions and fees and, of this amount, approximately $2.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, were re-allowed to selected broker-dealers. As of September 30, 2016, total distribution fee payable was approximately $2.2 million, as reflected on the statements of assets and liabilities. The following table reflects the payment schedule of the distribution fee payable:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period as of September 30, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution fee payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,191,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>580,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,160,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>450,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, we purchased a B-Note that provides for a total lending commitment of approximately $3.5 million. As of September 30, 2016, the unfunded commitment on this investment was approximately $0.4 million. We expect to fund this commitment in the next year.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. The amendments provide a definition of the term substantial doubt\u201d and include principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans. The amendments also require an evaluation every reporting period, including interim periods for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued), and certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated or not alleviated. The amendments in this update are effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016. We elected to early adopt ASU 2014-15 beginning October 1, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (ASC Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d). ASU 2015-02 significantly changes the consolidation analysis required under U.S. GAAP and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity guidance. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt ASU 2015-02 beginning October 1, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 beginning October 1, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d). ASU 2016-01 retains many current requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments; however, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (i) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (ii) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU 2016-01 also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted for public business entities. We are currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, a consensus of the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our financial statements and disclosures.\nRelated Party Transactions\nCompensation of Terra Income Advisors and Terra Capital Markets\nPursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay Terra Income Advisors a base management fee and an incentive fee. We commenced accruing fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement on June 24, 2015, upon commencement of our operations.\nThe base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.0% of our average gross assets. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The base management fee may or may not be taken in whole or in part at the discretion of Terra Income Advisors. All or any part of the base management fee not taken as to any quarter will be deferred without interest and may be taken in such other quarter as Terra Income Advisors shall determine. The base management fee for any partial month or quarter will be prorated for such partial period.\nThe incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part, which we refer to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon our pre-incentive fee net investment income\u201d for the immediately preceding quarter. The subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a quarterly hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital at the beginning of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 2.0% (8.0% annualized), subject to a catch-up\u201d feature. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income\u201d means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, other than fees for providing managerial assistance, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses reimbursed to Terra Income Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The calculation of the subordinated incentive fee on income for each quarter is as follows:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>No incentive fee is payable to Terra Income Advisors in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 2.0% (8.0% annualized);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to Terra Income Advisors, all or any portion of which may be waived or deferred in Terra Income Advisors' discretion. We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5%) as the catch-up.\u201d The catch-up\u201d provision is intended to provide Terra Income Advisors with an incentive fee of 20.0% on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income when our pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>20.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to Terra Income Advisors once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The second part of the incentive fee, which we refer to as the incentive fee on capital gains, is an incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments from the portfolio and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of our incentive fee on capital gains, which equals our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue (but do not pay) for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.\nWe reimburse Terra Income Advisors for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operation. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (i) Terra Income Advisors' actual costs incurred in providing such services and (ii) the amount that the Board, including a majority of our independent directors, estimates we would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. Terra Income Advisors is required to allocate the cost of such services to us based on objective factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Board then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements based on the breadth, depth and quality of such\nservices as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party providers known to be available. In addition, the Board considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Board compares the total amount paid to Terra Income Advisors for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse Terra Income Advisors for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of Terra Income Advisors.\nTerra Income Advisors has funded our offering costs and organization costs. Organization expenses are expensed on our statement of operations. All offering costs incurred during the offering period are recorded as deferred charge and amortized over twelve months from the date the cost is incurred, with the exception of those costs that were incurred prior to the commencement of operations on June 24, 2015, which are being amortized over a twelve month period from that date forward. Terra Income Advisors is responsible for the payment of our cumulative organization and offering expenses to the extent such expenses exceed 1.5% of the gross proceeds from the Offering, without recourse against or reimbursement by us. As a result, Terra Income Advisors will bear all organization and offering expenses in excess of 1.5% of the gross proceeds from the Offering. Through September 30, 2016, we believe that it is highly likely that we will raise sufficient funds to reimburse Terra Income Advisors in full for all cumulative organization and offering expenses incurred to date and has accrued those expenses and costs. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, Terra Income Advisors funded offering costs and organization costs in the amount of approximately $2.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The unreimbursed amount in excess of the 1.5% threshold was approximately $1.6 million and $1.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is included in Due to Adviser, net on the statements of assets and liabilities. For the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we made reimbursement payments of approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, to Terra Income Advisors for offering costs incurred on our behalf.\nUnder the Dealer Manager Agreement, Terra Capital Markets is entitled to receive selling commissions, broker-dealer fees and dealer manager fees in connection with the sale of shares of common stock in the Offering, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers. On April 27, 2016, we adopted the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement to change the terms of the underwriting compensation For the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately $3.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of broker-dealer commissions and fees and, of this amount, approximately $2.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, were re-allowed to selected broker-dealers. As of September 30, 2016, total distribution fee payable was approximately $2.2 million, as reflected on the statements of assets and liabilities.\nPursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, Terra Income Advisors has agreed to reimburse us for certain operating expenses for any period since inception, until we and Terra Income Advisors mutually agree otherwise. This payment for any month shall be paid by Terra Income Advisors to us in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds, and/or offsets against amounts due from us to Terra Income Advisors. Reimbursement shall be made as promptly as possible on a date mutually agreed to by us and Terra Income Advisors provided that (i) the operating expense ratio, defined as Net Operating Expenses expressed as a percentage of our net assets on the relevant measurement date, as of such reimbursement date is equal to or less than the operating expense ratio as of the Expense Support Payment date attributable to such specified Expense Support Payment, (ii) the annualized distribution rate as of such reimbursement date is equal to or greater than the annualized distribution rate as of the Expense Support Payment date attributable to such specified Expense Support Payment; (iii) such reimbursement date is not later than three years following such specified Expense Support Payment date; and (iv) the Expense Support Payment does not cause our Net Operating Expenses to exceed 1.5% of our net assets attributable to common shares, after taking such reimbursement into account. Terra Income Advisors is entitled to reimbursement of all previously unreimbursed Expense Support Payments in the event of termination of the Expense Support Agreement. For the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded total Expense Support Payments of approximately $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, which are included in the statements of operations. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded cumulative Expense Support Payments of approximately $2.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively, which are included in Due to Adviser, net on the statements of assets and liabilities.\nPotential Conflicts of Interest\nTerra Income Advisors, our investment adviser, currently serves as the investment manager to the Terra Income Funds. While Terra Income Advisors intends to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner consistent with our investment objectives and strategies, if necessary, so that we will not be disadvantaged in relation to any other client of Terra Income Advisors, it is possible that some investment opportunities may be provided to the Terra Income Funds rather than to us.\nExemptive Relief\nThe SEC has granted us exemptive relief from the provisions of Sections 17(d) and 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, thereby permitting us, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions with our Co-Investment Affiliates. However, we will be prohibited from engaging in certain transactions with our affiliates even under the terms of this exemptive order. We believe the relief granted to us under this exemptive order may not only enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategies, but may also increase favorable investment opportunities for us, in part by allowing\nus to participate in larger investments, together with our Co-Investment Affiliates, than would be available to us in the absence of such relief.\nOn April 19, 2016, the Board approved the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement. Under the terms of the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, Terra Capital Markets receives selling commissions, dealer manager fees and broker-dealer fees of 3.0%, 1.5% and 1.0%, respectively, of gross proceeds from the Offering, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers for marketing and expenses. In addition, Terra Capital Markets receives a distribution fee at an annual rate of 1.125% of gross offering proceeds, excluding shares sold through the distribution reinvestment plan. The distribution fee is payable annually with respect to each share sold in the primary offering on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the month of purchase.\nIn connection with the approval of the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, Terra Capital Markets reimbursed us an amount equal to the distribution fees expected to be paid on all outstanding shares of common stock as of April 27, 2016. Both Terra Capital Markets and Terra Income Advisors are subsidiaries of Terra Capital Partners, our sponsor. Therefore, the distribution fee reimbursement and the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement may be deemed a \u2018\u2018joint enterprise or other joint arrangement'' within the meaning of the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Accordingly, to eliminate any uncertainty, we applied for and were granted exemptive relief from the provisions of Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 under the 1940 Act by the SEC, pursuant to an exemptive order permitting Terra Capital Markets, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to effect the distribution fee reimbursement. We believe the distribution fee reimbursement, the changes to the selling commissions, dealer manager fees, and broker-dealer fees, and implementation of the distribution fee, is likely to lead to greater demand for our common stock in the Offering, which we believe will further benefit our investors by facilitating a lower operating expense ratio and greater diversification of its investment

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In this report, we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Terra Income Fund 6, Inc.\nPlease see Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on May 15, 2013 and commenced operations on June 24, 2015, upon the raising of gross proceeds in excess of the Minimum Offering Requirement. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, and have elected to be taxed for federal income tax purposes, beginning with our taxable year ended September 30, 2015, and to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Prior to satisfying the Minimum Offering Requirement, we have no operations except for matters relating to our organization and registration.\nOur investment activities are externally managed by Terra Income Advisors and supervised by the Board, a majority of whom are independent. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay Terra Income Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average quarterly gross assets, as well as incentive fees based on our performance. (See Related Party Transactions).\nAlso, we have agreed to pay selling commissions, broker-dealer fees, a dealer manager fee and distribution fees, and to reimburse Terra Income Advisors for our organization and offering expenses up to a maximum amount equal to 1.5% of the gross proceeds from the Offering. Terra Income Advisors will bear all organization and offering expenses in excess of this amount.\nOur primary investment objectives are to pay attractive and stable cash distributions and to preserve, protect and return capital contributions to stockholders. Our investment strategy is to use substantially all of the proceeds of the Offering to originate and manage a diversified portfolio consisting of (i) commercial real estate loans to U.S. companies qualifying as eligible portfolio companies\u201d under the 1940 Act, including mezzanine loans, first and second lien mortgage loans, subordinated mortgage loans, bridge loans and other commercial real estate-related loans related to or secured by high quality commercial real estate in the United States and (ii) preferred equity real estate investments in U.S. companies qualifying as eligible portfolio companies\u201d under the 1940 Act. We may also purchase select commercial real estate-related debt securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities or collateralized debt obligations; provided, however, that we will select all investments after considering our ability to qualify to be taxed as a RIC.\nThe level of our investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to prospective borrowers, the level of refinancing activity for such companies, the availability of credit to finance transactions, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. Based on prevailing market conditions exclusive of the restrictions imposed by the RIC diversification requirement, we anticipate that we will invest the proceeds from each subscription closing generally within 90 days of such closing. The precise timing will depend on the availability of investment opportunities that are consistent with our investment objective and strategies. Any distributions we make prior to the time that all capital raised has been deployed may be substantially lower than the distributions that we expect to pay when our portfolio is fully invested.\nOur management is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, which may reasonably be anticipated to have a material impact on the capital resources and the revenue or income to be derived from our assets.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest on the debt securities that we hold. We make debt investments that bear interest at fixed and floating rates. Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of exit fees payable upon repayment of the loans we hold, origination fees for loans we originate, commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Preferred returns earned on any preferred equity investments, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include interest expense from obligations under participation agreements, amortization of deferred offering costs, professional fees, marketing expenses, payment of adviser fees and reimbursement of expenses to Terra Income Advisors and other expenses necessary for our operations. We bear other expenses, which include, among other things:\n \u2022 corporate, organizational and offering expenses relating to offerings of our common stock, subject to limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement; \n \u2022 the cost of calculating our NAV, including the related fees and cost of any third-party valuation services; \n \u2022 the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; \n \u2022 fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, monitoring our financial and legal affairs; \n \u2022 making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments; \n \u2022 interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; \n \u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees; \n \u2022 distribution fees; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \n \u2022 federal and state registration fees; \n \u2022 federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses, including travel expenses; \n \u2022 costs of director and stockholder meetings, proxy statements, stockholders' reports and notices; \n \u2022 costs of fidelity bonds, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 direct costs, including those relating to printing of stockholder reports and advertising or sales materials, mailing and long distance telephone expenses; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; \n \u2022 costs associated with our chief compliance officer; \n \u2022 brokerage commissions for our investments; and \n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by us or Terra Income Advisors in connection with administering our investment portfolio, including expenses incurred by Terra Income Advisors in performing certain of its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement.  We reimburse Terra Income Advisors for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operation. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (i) Terra Income Advisors' actual costs incurred in providing such services and (ii) the amount that the Board, including a majority of our independent directors, estimates we would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. Terra Income Advisors is required to allocate the cost of such services to us based on objective factors, such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Board then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party providers known to be available. In addition, the Board considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Board compares the total amount paid to Terra Income Advisors for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse Terra Income Advisors for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of Terra Income Advisors.\nNet Investment Portfolio\nThe tables below present our investment portfolio on a net investment basis, which represents our proportionate share of the investments, based on our economic ownership of these investments. This measure is used in reports to our executive management and is used as a component to the asset base from which we calculate our base management fee. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it represents our total assets under management and the financial exposure of each investment individually.\n\n\nPortfolio Investment Activity\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we invested approximately $26.4 million in four new loans and had no exits or repayments, resulting in net gross investments made of approximately $26.4 million for the period.\nFor the year end September 30, 2015, we made a $2.0 million investment through a participation interest in a portfolio company and had no exits or repayments, resulting in a net gross investment of approximately $2.0 million for the period.\nOur portfolio composition, based on fair value at September 30, 2016 and 2015, was as follows:\n\n_______________\n (1) Based upon the par value of our debt investments. \nThe following table shows the portfolio composition by property type grouping based on fair value at September 30, 2016 and 2015:\n\nThe following table presents the fair value measurements at September 30, 2016 and 2015:\n\nObligations under Participation Agreements\nWe may enter into participation agreements with related and unrelated parties, primarily other affiliated funds of our sponsor. The purpose of the participation agreements is to allow us and an affiliate to originate a specified investment when, individually, we do not have the liquidity to do so or to achieve a certain level of portfolio diversification. We may transfer portions of our investments to other participants or we may be a participant to an investment held by another entity.\nCertain partial loan sales do not qualify for sale accounting under Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 860 -\nTransfers and Servicing ( ASC Topic 860\u201d) because these sales do not meet the definition of a participating interest,\u201d as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain as an investment on the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities and the portion transferred is recorded as obligations under participation agreements in the liabilities section of the statements of assets and liabilities.\nAs of September 30, 2016, obligations under participation agreements at fair value totaled approximately $14.6 million and the fair value of the loans that are associated with these obligations under participation agreements was approximately $21.2 million. As of September 30, 2015, we did not have any obligations under participation agreements. For the year ended September 30, 2016, there were no repayments on obligations under participation agreements. The weighted average interest rate on our obligations under participation agreements was approximately 13.9% as of September 30, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nWe were formed on May 15, 2013, and commenced operations on June 24, 2015. Our management is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting our target portfolio, which may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact of the capital resources and the revenue or income to be derived from the operations of our net assets.\nOperating results for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\n\nInvestment Income\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, total investment income was approximately $3.0 million and was attributable to five loans made for approximately $28.6 million with a weighted average annual interest rate of 13.3% as of September 30, 2016. For the year ended September 30, 2015, total investment income was approximately $0.1 million and was attributable to a loan made for approximately $2.0 million with an annualized interest rate of 12.0%. There was no investment income for the year ended September 30, 2014. The increase in total investment income for both the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 over the same period in the respective prior year was primarily due to our commencement of operations on of June 24, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nThe composition of our operating expenses for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\n\nOur primary operating expenses include interest expense from obligations under participation agreements, amortization of deferred offering costs, professional fees, marketing expenses, which include the costs of educational and training seminars and other marketing related expenses, base management fees, operating expense reimbursement to Adviser, insurance expense and directors' fees. Operating expense reimbursement to Adviser include reimbursements to Terra Income Advisors for operating expenses incurred in connection with administrative services provided to us, including compensation to administrative personnel.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses was approximately $6.0 million, compared to approximately $1.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2015 and approximately $0.03 million for the year ended September 30, 2014. The increase in total operating expense for both the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 over the same period in the respective prior year was primarily due to our commencement of operations on June 24, 2015. In addition, for the year ended September 30,\n2016, we transferred a portion of two investments to an affiliated fund which resulted in total interest expense from obligations under participation agreements of approximately $1.6 million.\nExpense Support and Reimbursement Agreement\nOn June 30, 2015, we entered into an expense support agreement (the Expense Support Agreement\u201d) with Terra Income Advisors, whereby Terra Income Advisors may pay up to 100% of our costs and expenses for any period since inception, including all fees payable to the advisor pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, until we and Terra Income Advisors mutually agree otherwise. This payment (the Expense Support Payment\u201d) for any month shall be paid by Terra Income Advisors to us in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds, and/or offsets against amounts due from us to Terra Income Advisors. The purpose of the Expense Support Payment is to reduce offering and operating expenses until we have achieved economies of scale sufficient to ensure that we are able to bear a reasonable level of expense in relation to investment income. Operating expenses subject to the Expense Support Agreement include expenses as determined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), including, without limitation, fees payable to Terra Income Advisors and interest on indebtedness for such period, if any.\nPursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse Terra Income Advisors for each Expense Support Payment within three years after such Expense Support Payment is made by Terra Income Advisors. Reimbursement shall be made as promptly as possible on a date mutually agreed to by us and Terra Income Advisors (provided that (i) the operating expense ratio, defined as operating expenses excluding organization and offering expenses, base management fees, incentive fees and any interest expense attributable to indebtedness by us ( Net Operating Expenses\u201d) expressed as a percentage of our net assets on the relevant measurement date, as of such reimbursement date is equal to or less than the operating expense ratio as of the Expense Support Payment date attributable to such specified Expense Support Payment, (ii) the annualized distribution rate as of such reimbursement date is equal to or greater than the annualized distribution rate as of the Expense Support Payment date attributable to such specified Expense Support Payment; (iii) such reimbursement date is not later than three years following such specified Expense Support Payment date; and (iv) the Expense Support Payment does not cause our Net Operating Expenses to exceed 1.5% of our net assets attributable to common shares, after taking such reimbursement into account. Terra Income Advisors is entitled to reimbursement of all previously unreimbursed Expense Support Payments in the event of termination of the Expense Support Agreement.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized expense reimbursements made by Terra Income Advisors of approximately $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, which are included in the statements of operations. For the year ended September 30, 2014, we did not record any expense reimbursement payments.\nNet Increase in Unrealized Appreciation on Investments and Obligations under Participation Agreements\nNet increase in unrealized appreciation on investments and obligations under participation agreements reflects the change in our portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses, when gains or losses are realized. Valuation of our portfolio investments fluctuates over time, reflecting changes in the market yields for loans and debt investments, and any associated premium or discount will be amortized down or accreted up to par value as each investment approaches maturity.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, net increase in unrealized appreciation on investments was approximately $0.2 million and net increase in unrealized appreciation on obligations under participation agreements was approximately $0.1 million. For the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, there was no change in unrealized appreciation on our investments or obligations under participation agreements. The net increase in unrealized appreciation on our investments and obligations under participation agreements for the year ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to our commencement of operations on June 24, 2015, which increased our investments in the portfolio for the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year.\nNet (Decrease) Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a net (decrease) increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $(2.3) million, $0.01 million and $(0.03) million, respectively. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the year ended September 30, 2016 and from June 24, 2015, the commencement of operations, to September 30, 2015, our per share net (decrease) increase in net assets resulting from operations was $(0.93) and $0.01, respectively.\nCapital Contribution from Terra Capital Partners\nPursuant to an initial capitalization and subsequent private placement, Terra Capital Partners had purchased an aggregate of $175,000 of shares of our common stock at $11.25 per share, which price represented the initial public offering price of $12.50 per share, net of selling commissions, broker-dealer fees and dealer manager fees. On February 25, 2015, the Board determined to change the initial offering price from $10.00 per share to $12.50 per share. As a result, on February 26, 2015, we effected a reverse stock split to account for the change in our offering price since the initial investment by Terra Capital Partners. As such, all share references and equity transaction pricing elsewhere reflect this reverse stock split. On May 1, 2015, Terra Capital Partners\nalso purchased an additional $275,000 of shares of our common stock from the Offering at $11.25 per share, also net of selling commissions, broker-dealer fees and dealer manager fees from the current offering price of $12.50 per share. As a result, gross offering proceeds of $450,000 are immediately available to us. The gross offering proceeds from Terra Capital Partners' capital contributions have been included for purposes of determining our satisfaction of the Minimum Offering Requirement.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe currently generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of the Offering and from cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. Our primary use of cash is for our targeted investments, payments of our expenses and cash distributions to our stockholders. We sell our shares on a continuous basis at a per share price of $12.50. However, to the extent that our NAV per share increases to an amount greater than our net proceeds as stated in our prospectus dated April 27, 2016, we will sell at a price necessary to ensure that our shares are not sold at a price, after deduction of selling commissions, broker-dealer fees and dealer manager fees, that is below NAV per share. On November 11, 2015, and effective as December 1, 2015, the Board approved a change to a certain aspect of our share pricing policy such that, once we have raised gross offering proceeds in excess of $125 million, or prior to then in the sole discretion of our Board, in the event of a material decline in our NAV per share, which we consider to be a 2.5% decrease below our then-current net offering price, we will reduce our offering price to establish a new net offering price not more than 2.5% above our NAV per share.\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we will invest the net proceeds from the Offering and from sales and paydowns of existing investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our intended BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nWe may borrow funds to make investments, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of our continuous offering, to the extent we determine that leveraging our portfolio would be appropriate. We have not decided whether, and to what extent, we will finance portfolio investments using debt or the specific form that any such financing would take. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty what terms any such financing would have or the costs we would incur in connection with any such arrangement. We currently do not anticipate issuing any preferred stock; however, our charter authorizes us to do so.\nOur principal demands for funds are for portfolio investments, either directly or through investment interests, for the payment of operating expenses, distributions to our investors and for the payment of principal and interest on any outstanding indebtedness we may acquire. Generally, cash needs for investment activities will be met through proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through the Offering. Management expects that in the future, as our investment portfolio grows, our investments will generate sufficient cash flow to cover operating expenses and the payment of a monthly distribution.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended September 30, 2016\nOperating Activities - For the year ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was approximately $13.4 million. The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of purchases, redemptions and sales of portfolio investments, among other factors. Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2016 were primarily purchases of investments totaling approximately $26.3 million, partially offset by net proceeds from obligations under participation agreements of approximately $14.3 million.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $36.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of common stock of approximately $39.9 million and reimbursement of approximately $1.3 million from Terra Capital Markets for commissions and dealer manager fees we paid related to shares sold prior to February 20, 2016 (see Contractual Obligations\u201d below), partially offset by payments of selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution fees of approximately $2.8 million and distributions paid to shareholders of approximately $1.6 million.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended September 30, 2015\nOperating Activities - For the year ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was approximately $2.0 million, primarily due to a purchase of an investment for approximately $2.0 million. The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of purchases, redemptions and sales of portfolio investments, among other factors.\nFinancing Activities - Cash flows provided by financing activities was approximately $10.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, primarily related to proceeds from issuance of common stock of approximately $11.2 million, partially offset by payments of selling commissions and dealer manager fees of approximately $0.9 million and distributions paid to shareholders of approximately $0.1 million.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended September 30, 2014\nFinancing Activities - Cash flows provided by financing activities was approximately $0.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2014, representing Terra Capital Partners' initial capital contribution to us.\nRIC Status and Distributions\nWe have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes and to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute at least 90.0% of our investment company taxable income,\u201d as defined by the Code, each year. As long as the distributions are declared by the later of the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of the taxable year or the due date of the tax return, including extensions, distributions paid up to one year after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for determining the distributions paid in such tax year. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to qualify for and maintain our RIC status each year. We are also subject to nondeductible federal excise taxes if we do not distribute at least 98.0% of net ordinary income, 98.2% of any capital gain net income, if any, and any recognized and undistributed income from prior years on which we paid no federal income taxes.\nDistributions to our stockholders are recorded as of the record date. Subject to the discretion of the Board and applicable legal restrictions, we authorize and declare ordinary cash distributions on either a monthly or quarterly basis and pay such distributions on a monthly basis. We calculate each stockholder's specific distribution amount for the period using daily record dates, and each stockholder's distributions begin to accrue on the date we accept such stockholder's subscription for shares of our common stock. From time to time at the discretion of the Board, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or shares of common stock.\nDuring certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from the Offering of our common stock. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make will represent a return of capital for tax purposes. A return of capital generally is a return of an investor's investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with the Offering, including any fees payable to Terra Income Advisors. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our stockholders.\nWe intend to continue to make our ordinary distributions in the form of cash out of assets legally available for distribution, unless stockholders elect to receive their cash distributions in additional shares of our common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. stockholder.\nWe have adopted an opt in\u201d distribution reinvestment plan for our stockholders. As a result, if we make a cash distribution, our stockholders will receive distributions in cash unless they specifically opt in\u201d to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. However, certain state authorities or regulators may impose restrictions from time to time that may prevent or limit a stockholder's ability to participate in the distribution reinvestment plan.\nWe may fund our cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds available to us, including offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make distributions.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As we execute our expected operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.\nValuation of Investments\nWe measure the value of our investments in accordance with fair value accounting guidance promulgated under U.S. GAAP, which establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework that prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring investments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily available actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices, generally, will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value.\nInvestments measured and reported at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\n \u2022 Level 1 - observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets. Publicly listed equities and publicly listed derivatives will be included in Level 1. In addition, securities sold, but not yet purchased, and call options will be included in Level 1. \n \u2022 Level 2 - observable inputs such as for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities in markets that are not active. In certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices, market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. Investments which are generally expected to be included in this category include corporate bonds and loans, convertible debt indexed to publicly listed securities and certain over-the-counter derivatives. \n \u2022 Level 3 - unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation.  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the investment. We expect most of the investments that will be held in the investment portfolio to fall into Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nValuation of Obligations under Participation Agreements\nWe have elected the fair value option under ASC Topic 825 - Financial Instruments relating to accounting for debt obligations at their fair value for obligations under participation agreements which arose due to partial loan sales which did not meet the criteria for sale treatment under ASC Topic 860. We employ the yield approach valuation methodology used for the real-estate related loan investments on our obligations under participation agreements. As of September 30, 2016, obligations under participation agreements at fair value totaled approximately $14.6 million and the fair value of the loans that are associated with these obligations under participation agreements is approximately $21.2 million. For the year ended September 30, 2016, there were no repayments on obligations under participation agreements. The weighted average interest rate on our obligations under participation agreements was approximately 13.9% as of September 30, 2016.\nRevenue Recognition\nSecurity transactions are accounted for on their trade date. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. We do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if there is reason to doubt the collectability of such income. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and such amounts are amortized into interest income as a yield adjustment using the effective interest method over the respective term of the loan. Upon the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and securities as interest income when we receive such amounts.\nOrganization Costs\nOrganization costs include, among other things, the cost of incorporating, including the cost of legal services and other fees pertaining to our organization. These costs are expensed as incurred. For the period from May 15, 2013 (inception) to September 30, 2016, we incurred cumulative organization costs totaling approximately $0.2 million, which were paid on behalf of us by Terra Income Advisors and have been recorded as a payable to it. For the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, we incurred approximately $0.1 million and $0.03 million of organization costs, respectively. We did not incur any organization costs for the year ended September 30, 2016.\nOffering Costs\nOur offering costs include, among other things, legal and printing costs pertaining to preparation of the initial registration statement and prospectus and registration fees relating to the Offering. All offering costs incurred during the offering period are\nrecorded as deferred charge and amortized over twelve months from the date the cost is incurred, with the exception of those costs that were incurred prior to the commencement of operations on June 24, 2015, which were amortized over a twelve month period from that date forward. For the period from our inception on May 15, 2013 to September 30, 2016, we incurred cumulative offering costs totaling approximately $2.2 million. For the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded approximately $1.3 million and $0.4 million of amortization of deferred offering costs, respectively.\nIncentive Fee on Capital Gains\nPursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee on capital gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of our incentive fee on capital gains, which equals the realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue (but do not pay) for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period. While the Investment Advisory Agreement neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we accrue for this incentive fee to include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to Terra Income Advisors if our entire portfolio were liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though Terra Income Advisors is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.\nFederal Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be taxed for federal income tax purposes, and to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders from our earnings and profits as determined for federal income tax purposes. To obtain and maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute annually at least 90.0% of our ordinary net income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any.\nRecognition of a tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax liabilities as income tax expense in the statement of operations. For the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not incur any interest or penalties.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. On April 20, 2015, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Terra Income Advisors in accordance with the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement became effective on June 24, 2015, the date that we met the Minimum Offering Requirement. Terra Income Advisors serves as our investment adviser in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Payments under the Investment Advisory Agreement in each reporting period will consist of (i) a base management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our average gross assets and (ii) an incentive fee based on our performance. Terra Income Advisors will be reimbursed for allocated administrative expenses incurred on our behalf. For the year ended September 30, 2016 and for the period from our commencement of operations on June 24, 2015 through September 30, 2015, we incurred approximately $0.6 million and $0.03 million, respectively, in base management fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. For the year ended September 30, 2016, we accrued incentive fees on capital gains of approximately $0.03 million, based on net unrealized capital gains of approximately $0.1 million. No incentive fees on capital gains are actually payable by us with respect to unrealized gains unless and until those gains are actually realized. There were no such fees for the year ended September 30, 2015.\nOn April 20, 2015, we entered into a dealer manager agreement (the Dealer Manager Agreement\u201d) with Terra Capital Markets, an affiliate of Terra Income Advisors, to serve as the dealer manager of the Offering. As dealer manager, Terra Capital Markets is responsible for marketing our shares being offered pursuant to the Offering. In this role, it will manage a group of selling dealers, including other unaffiliated broker-dealers who enter into Selected Dealer Arrangements with Terra Capital Markets. Terra Capital Markets received selling commissions, dealer manager fees and broker-dealer fees of 6.0%, 3.0% and 1.0%, respectively, of gross proceeds from the Offering, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers for marketing and expenses.\nOn April 19, 2016, the Board approved an amended and restated dealer manager agreement (the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement\u201d), which we adopted on April 27, 2016. Under the terms of the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, Terra Capital Markets receives selling commissions, dealer manager fees and broker-dealer fees of 3.0%, 1.5% and 1.0%, respectively, of gross proceeds from the Offering, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers for marketing and expenses. In addition, Terra Capital Markets receives a distribution fee at an annual rate of 1.125% of gross offering proceeds, excluding shares sold through the distribution reinvestment plan, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers for\nservices performed in connection with the distribution of our shares. The distribution fee is payable annually with respect to each share sold in the primary offering on the first, second, third, and fourth anniversaries of the month of purchase. In connection with the adoption of the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, Terra Capital Markets reimbursed us approximately $1.3 million for selling commissions and dealer manager fees we paid related to the shares sold on and prior to February 20, 2016, the last shareholder admittance date prior to the adoption of the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement. The reimbursement amount will be paid back to Terra Capital Markets on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the months of purchase.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately $3.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of broker-dealer commissions and fees and, of this amount, approximately $2.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, were re-allowed to selected broker-dealers. As of September 30, 2016, total distribution fee payable was approximately $2.2 million, as reflected on the statements of assets and liabilities. The following table reflects the payment schedule of the distribution fee payable:\n\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, we purchased a B-Note that provides for a total lending commitment of approximately $3.5 million. As of September 30, 2016, the unfunded commitment on this investment was approximately $0.4 million. We expect to fund this commitment in the next year.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. The amendments provide a definition of the term substantial doubt\u201d and include principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans. The amendments also require an evaluation every reporting period, including interim periods for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued), and certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated or not alleviated. The amendments in this update are effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016. We elected to early adopt ASU 2014-15 beginning October 1, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (ASC Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d). ASU 2015-02 significantly changes the consolidation analysis required under U.S. GAAP and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity guidance. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt ASU 2015-02 beginning October 1, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 beginning October 1, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d). ASU 2016-01 retains many current requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments; however, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (i) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (ii) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU 2016-01 also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted for public business entities. We are currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, a consensus of the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our financial statements and disclosures.\nRelated Party Transactions\nCompensation of Terra Income Advisors and Terra Capital Markets\nPursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay Terra Income Advisors a base management fee and an incentive fee. We commenced accruing fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement on June 24, 2015, upon commencement of our operations.\nThe base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.0% of our average gross assets. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The base management fee may or may not be taken in whole or in part at the discretion of Terra Income Advisors. All or any part of the base management fee not taken as to any quarter will be deferred without interest and may be taken in such other quarter as Terra Income Advisors shall determine. The base management fee for any partial month or quarter will be prorated for such partial period.\nThe incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part, which we refer to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon our pre-incentive fee net investment income\u201d for the immediately preceding quarter. The subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a quarterly hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital at the beginning of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 2.0% (8.0% annualized), subject to a catch-up\u201d feature. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income\u201d means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, other than fees for providing managerial assistance, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses reimbursed to Terra Income Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The calculation of the subordinated incentive fee on income for each quarter is as follows:\n \u2022 No incentive fee is payable to Terra Income Advisors in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 2.0% (8.0% annualized); \n \u2022 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to Terra Income Advisors, all or any portion of which may be waived or deferred in Terra Income Advisors' discretion. We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5%) as the catch-up.\u201d The catch-up\u201d provision is intended to provide Terra Income Advisors with an incentive fee of 20.0% on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income when our pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and \n \u2022 20.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to Terra Income Advisors once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved.  The second part of the incentive fee, which we refer to as the incentive fee on capital gains, is an incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments from the portfolio and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of our incentive fee on capital gains, which equals our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue (but do not pay) for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.\nWe reimburse Terra Income Advisors for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operation. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (i) Terra Income Advisors' actual costs incurred in providing such services and (ii) the amount that the Board, including a majority of our independent directors, estimates we would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. Terra Income Advisors is required to allocate the cost of such services to us based on objective factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Board then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements based on the breadth, depth and quality of such\nservices as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party providers known to be available. In addition, the Board considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Board compares the total amount paid to Terra Income Advisors for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse Terra Income Advisors for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of Terra Income Advisors.\nTerra Income Advisors has funded our offering costs and organization costs. Organization expenses are expensed on our statement of operations. All offering costs incurred during the offering period are recorded as deferred charge and amortized over twelve months from the date the cost is incurred, with the exception of those costs that were incurred prior to the commencement of operations on June 24, 2015, which are being amortized over a twelve month period from that date forward. Terra Income Advisors is responsible for the payment of our cumulative organization and offering expenses to the extent such expenses exceed 1.5% of the gross proceeds from the Offering, without recourse against or reimbursement by us. As a result, Terra Income Advisors will bear all organization and offering expenses in excess of 1.5% of the gross proceeds from the Offering. Through September 30, 2016, we believe that it is highly likely that we will raise sufficient funds to reimburse Terra Income Advisors in full for all cumulative organization and", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In this report, we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Terra Income Fund 6, Inc.\nPlease see Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on May 15, 2013 and commenced operations on June 24, 2015, upon the raising of gross proceeds in excess of the Minimum Offering Requirement. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, and have elected to be taxed for federal income tax purposes, beginning with our taxable year ended September 30, 2015, and to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Prior to satisfying the Minimum Offering Requirement, we have no operations except for matters relating to our organization and registration.\nOur investment activities are externally managed by Terra Income Advisors and supervised by the Board, a majority of whom are independent. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay Terra Income Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average quarterly gross assets, as well as incentive fees based on our performance. (See Related Party Transactions).\nAlso, we have agreed to pay selling commissions, broker-dealer fees, a dealer manager fee and distribution fees, and to reimburse Terra Income Advisors for our organization and offering expenses up to a maximum amount equal to 1.5% of the gross proceeds from the Offering. Terra Income Advisors will bear all organization and offering expenses in excess of this amount.\nOur primary investment objectives are to pay attractive and stable cash distributions and to preserve, protect and return capital contributions to stockholders. Our investment strategy is to use substantially all of the proceeds of the Offering to originate and manage a diversified portfolio consisting of (i) commercial real estate loans to U.S. companies qualifying as eligible portfolio companies\u201d under the 1940 Act, including mezzanine loans, first and second lien mortgage loans, subordinated mortgage loans, bridge loans and other commercial real estate-related loans related to or secured by high quality commercial real estate in the United States and (ii) preferred equity real estate investments in U.S. companies qualifying as eligible portfolio companies\u201d under the 1940 Act. We may also purchase select commercial real estate-related debt securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities or collateralized debt obligations; provided, however, that we will select all investments after considering our ability to qualify to be taxed as a RIC.\nThe level of our investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to prospective borrowers, the level of refinancing activity for such companies, the availability of credit to finance transactions, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. Based on prevailing market conditions exclusive of the restrictions imposed by the RIC diversification requirement, we anticipate that we will invest the proceeds from each subscription closing generally within 90 days of such closing. The precise timing will depend on the availability of investment opportunities that are consistent with our investment objective and strategies. Any distributions we make prior to the time that all capital raised has been deployed may be substantially lower than the distributions that we expect to pay when our portfolio is fully invested.\nOur management is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, which may reasonably be anticipated to have a material impact on the capital resources and the revenue or income to be derived from our assets.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest on the debt securities that we hold. We make debt investments that bear interest at fixed and floating rates. Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of exit fees payable upon repayment of the loans we hold, origination fees for loans we originate, commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Preferred returns earned on any preferred equity investments, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include interest expense from obligations under participation agreements, amortization of deferred offering costs, professional fees, marketing expenses, payment of adviser fees and reimbursement of expenses to Terra Income Advisors and other expenses necessary for our operations. We bear other expenses, which include, among other things:\n \u2022 corporate, organizational and offering expenses relating to offerings of our common stock, subject to limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement; \n \u2022 the cost of calculating our NAV, including the related fees and cost of any third-party valuation services; \n \u2022 the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; \n \u2022 fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, monitoring our financial and legal affairs; \n \u2022 making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments; \n \u2022 interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; \n \u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees; \n \u2022 distribution fees; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \n \u2022 federal and state registration fees; \n \u2022 federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses, including travel expenses; \n \u2022 costs of director and stockholder meetings, proxy statements, stockholders' reports and notices; \n \u2022 costs of fidelity bonds, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 direct costs, including those relating to printing of stockholder reports and advertising or sales materials, mailing and long distance telephone expenses; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; \n \u2022 costs associated with our chief compliance officer; \n \u2022 brokerage commissions for our investments; and \n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by us or Terra Income Advisors in connection with administering our investment portfolio, including expenses incurred by Terra Income Advisors in performing certain of its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement.  We reimburse Terra Income Advisors for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operation. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (i) Terra Income Advisors' actual costs incurred in providing such services and (ii) the amount that the Board, including a majority of our independent directors, estimates we would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. Terra Income Advisors is required to allocate the cost of such services to us based on objective factors, such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Board then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party providers known to be available. In addition, the Board considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Board compares the total amount paid to Terra Income Advisors for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse Terra Income Advisors for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of Terra Income Advisors.\nNet Investment Portfolio\nThe tables below present our investment portfolio on a net investment basis, which represents our proportionate share of the investments, based on our economic ownership of these investments. This measure is used in reports to our executive management and is used as a component to the asset base from which we calculate our base management fee. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it represents our total assets under management and the financial exposure of each investment individually.\nTable 111:

affiliated funds of our sponsor. The purpose of the participation agreements is to allow us and an affiliate to originate a specified investment when, individually, we do not have the liquidity to do so or to achieve a certain level of portfolio diversification. We may transfer portions of our investments to other participants or we may be a participant to an investment held by another entity.\nCertain partial loan sales do not qualify for sale accounting under Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 860 -\nTransfers and Servicing ( ASC Topic 860\u201d) because these sales do not meet the definition of a participating interest,\u201d as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain as an investment on the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities and the portion transferred is recorded as obligations under participation agreements in the liabilities section of the statements of assets and liabilities.\nAs of September 30, 2016, obligations under participation agreements at fair value totaled approximately $14.6 million and the fair value of the loans that are associated with these obligations under participation agreements was approximately $21.2 million. As of September 30, 2015, we did not have any obligations under participation agreements. For the year ended September 30, 2016, there were no repayments on obligations under participation agreements. The weighted average interest rate on our obligations under participation agreements was approximately 13.9% as of September 30, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nWe were formed on May 15, 2013, and commenced operations on June 24, 2015.

The increase in total operating expense for both the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 over the same period in the respective prior year was primarily due to our commencement of operations on June 24, 2015. In addition, for the year ended September 30,\n2016, we transferred a portion of two investments to an affiliated fund which resulted in total interest expense from obligations under participation agreements of approximately $1.6 million.\nExpense Support and Reimbursement Agreement\nOn June 30, 2015, we entered into an expense support agreement (the Expense Support Agreement\u201d) with Terra Income Advisors, whereby Terra Income Advisors may pay up to 100% of our costs and expenses for any period since inception, including all fees payable to the advisor pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, until we and Terra Income Advisors mutually agree otherwise. This payment (the Expense Support Payment\u201d) for any month shall be paid by Terra Income Advisors to us in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds, and/or offsets against amounts due from us to Terra Income Advisors. The purpose of the Expense Support Payment is to reduce offering and operating expenses until we have achieved economies of scale sufficient to ensure that we are able to bear a reasonable level of expense in relation to investment income. Operating expenses subject to the Expense Support Agreement include expenses as determined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), including, without limitation, fees payable to Terra Income Advisors and interest on indebtedness for such period, if any.\nPursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse Terra Income Advisors for each Expense Support Payment within three years after such Expense Support Payment is made by Terra Income Advisors. Reimbursement shall be made as promptly as possible on a date mutually agreed to by us and Terra Income Advisors (provided that (i) the operating expense ratio, defined as operating expenses excluding organization and offering expenses, base management fees, incentive fees and any interest expense attributable to indebtedness by us ( Net Operating Expenses\u201d) expressed as a percentage of our net assets on the relevant measurement date, as of such reimbursement date is equal to or less than the operating expense ratio as of the Expense Support Payment date attributable to such specified Expense Support Payment, (ii) the annualized distribution rate as of such reimbursement date is equal to or greater than the annualized distribution rate as of the Expense Support Payment date attributable to such specified Expense Support Payment; (iii) such reimbursement date is not later than three years following such specified Expense Support Payment date; and (iv) the Expense Support Payment does not cause our Net Operating Expenses to exceed 1.5% of our net assets attributable to common shares, after taking such reimbursement into account. Terra Income Advisors is entitled to reimbursement of all previously unreimbursed Expense Support Payments in the event of termination of the Expense Support Agreement.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized expense reimbursements made by Terra Income Advisors of approximately $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, which are included in the statements of operations. For the year ended September 30, 2014, we did not record any expense reimbursement payments.\nNet Increase in Unrealized Appreciation on Investments and Obligations under Participation Agreements\nNet increase in unrealized appreciation on investments and obligations under participation agreements reflects the change in our portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses, when gains or losses are realized. Valuation of our portfolio investments fluctuates over time, reflecting changes in the market yields for loans and debt investments, and any associated premium or discount will be amortized down or accreted up to par value as each investment approaches maturity.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, net increase in unrealized appreciation on investments was approximately $0.2 million and net increase in unrealized appreciation on obligations under participation agreements was approximately $0.1 million. For the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, there was no change in unrealized appreciation on our investments or obligations under participation agreements. The net increase in unrealized appreciation on our investments and obligations under participation agreements for the year ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to our commencement of operations on June 24, 2015, which increased our investments in the portfolio for the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year.\nNet (Decrease) Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a net (decrease) increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $(2.3) million, $0.01 million and $(0.03) million, respectively. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the year ended September 30, 2016 and from June 24, 2015, the commencement of operations, to September 30, 2015, our per share net (decrease) increase in net assets resulting from operations was $(0.93) and $0.01, respectively.\nCapital Contribution from Terra Capital Partners\nPursuant to an initial capitalization and subsequent private placement, Terra Capital Partners had purchased an aggregate of $175,000 of shares of our common stock at $11.25 per share, which price represented the initial public offering price of $12.50 per share, net of selling commissions, broker-dealer fees and dealer manager fees. On February 25, 2015, the Board determined to change the initial offering price from $10.00 per share to $12.50 per share. As a result, on February 26, 2015, we effected a reverse stock split to account for the change in our offering price since the initial investment by Terra Capital Partners. As such, all share references and equity transaction pricing elsewhere reflect this reverse stock split. On May 1, 2015, Terra Capital Partners\nalso purchased an additional $275,000 of shares of our common stock from the Offering at $11.25 per share, also net of selling commissions, broker-dealer fees and dealer manager fees from the current offering price of $12.50 per share. As a result, gross offering proceeds of $450,000 are immediately available to us. The gross offering proceeds from Terra Capital Partners' capital contributions have been included for purposes of determining our satisfaction of the Minimum Offering Requirement.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe currently generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of the Offering and from cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. Our primary use of cash is for our targeted investments, payments of our expenses and cash distributions to our stockholders. We sell our shares on a continuous basis at a per share price of $12.50. However, to the extent that our NAV per share increases to an amount greater than our net proceeds as stated in our prospectus dated April 27, 2016, we will sell at a price necessary to ensure that our shares are not sold at a price, after deduction of selling commissions, broker-dealer fees and dealer manager fees, that is below NAV per share. On November 11, 2015, and effective as December 1, 2015, the Board approved a change to a certain aspect of our share pricing policy such that, once we have raised gross offering proceeds in excess of $125 million, or prior to then in the sole discretion of our Board, in the event of a material decline in our NAV per share, which we consider to be a 2.5% decrease below our then-current net offering price, we will reduce our offering price to establish a new net offering price not more than 2.5% above our NAV per share.\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we will invest the net proceeds from the Offering and from sales and paydowns of existing investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our intended BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nWe may borrow funds to make investments, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of our continuous offering, to the extent we determine that leveraging our portfolio would be appropriate. We have not decided whether, and to what extent, we will finance portfolio investments using debt or the specific form that any such financing would take. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty what terms any such financing would have or the costs we would incur in connection with any such arrangement. We currently do not anticipate issuing any preferred stock; however, our charter authorizes us to do so.\nOur principal demands for funds are for portfolio investments, either directly or through investment interests, for the payment of operating expenses, distributions to our investors and for the payment of principal and interest on any outstanding indebtedness we may acquire. Generally, cash needs for investment activities will be met through proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through the Offering. Management expects that in the future, as our investment portfolio grows, our investments will generate sufficient cash flow to cover operating expenses and the payment of a monthly distribution.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended September 30, 2016\nOperating Activities - For the year ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was approximately $13.4 million. The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of purchases, redemptions and sales of portfolio investments, among other factors. Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2016 were primarily purchases of investments totaling approximately $26.3 million, partially offset by net proceeds from obligations under participation agreements of approximately $14.3 million.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $36.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of common stock of approximately $39.9 million and reimbursement of approximately $1.3 million from Terra Capital Markets for commissions and dealer manager fees we paid related to shares sold prior to February 20, 2016 (see Contractual Obligations\u201d below), partially offset by payments of selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution fees of approximately $2.8 million and distributions paid to shareholders of approximately $1.6 million.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended September 30, 2015\nOperating Activities - For the year ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was approximately $2.0 million, primarily due to a purchase of an investment for approximately $2.0 million. The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of purchases, redemptions and sales of portfolio investments, among other factors.\nFinancing Activities - Cash flows provided by financing activities was approximately $10.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, primarily related to proceeds from issuance of common stock of approximately $11.2 million, partially offset by payments of selling commissions and dealer manager fees of approximately $0.9 million and distributions paid to shareholders of approximately $0.1 million.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended September 30, 2014\nFinancing Activities - Cash flows provided by financing activities was approximately $0.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2014, representing Terra Capital Partners' initial capital contribution to us.\nRIC Status and Distributions\nWe have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes and to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute at least 90.0% of our investment company taxable income,\u201d as defined by the Code, each year. As long as the distributions are declared by the later of the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of the taxable year or the due date of the tax return, including extensions, distributions paid up to one year after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for determining the distributions paid in such tax year. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to qualify for and maintain our RIC status each year. We are also subject to nondeductible federal excise taxes if we do not distribute at least 98.0% of net ordinary income, 98.2% of any capital gain net income, if any, and any recognized and undistributed income from prior years on which we paid no federal income taxes.\nDistributions to our stockholders are recorded as of the record date. Subject to the discretion of the Board and applicable legal restrictions, we authorize and declare ordinary cash distributions on either a monthly or quarterly basis and pay such distributions on a monthly basis. We calculate each stockholder's specific distribution amount for the period using daily record dates, and each stockholder's distributions begin to accrue on the date we accept such stockholder's subscription for shares of our common stock. From time to time at the discretion of the Board, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or shares of common stock.\nDuring certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from the Offering of our common stock. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make will represent a return of capital for tax purposes. A return of capital generally is a return of an investor's investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with the Offering, including any fees payable to Terra Income Advisors. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our stockholders.\nWe intend to continue to make our ordinary distributions in the form of cash out of assets legally available for distribution, unless stockholders elect to receive their cash distributions in additional shares of our common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. stockholder.\nWe have adopted an opt in\u201d distribution reinvestment plan for our stockholders. As a result, if we make a cash distribution, our stockholders will receive distributions in cash unless they specifically opt in\u201d to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. However, certain state authorities or regulators may impose restrictions from time to time that may prevent or limit a stockholder's ability to participate in the distribution reinvestment plan.\nWe may fund our cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds available to us, including offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make distributions.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As we execute our expected operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.\nValuation of Investments\nWe measure the value of our investments in accordance with fair value accounting guidance promulgated under U.S. GAAP, which establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework that prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring investments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily available actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices, generally, will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value.\nInvestments measured and reported at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\n \u2022 Level 1 - observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets. Publicly listed equities and publicly listed derivatives will be included in Level 1. In addition, securities sold, but not yet purchased, and call options will be included in Level 1. \n \u2022 Level 2 - observable inputs such as for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities in markets that are not active. In certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices, market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. Investments which are generally expected to be included in this category include corporate bonds and loans, convertible debt indexed to publicly listed securities and certain over-the-counter derivatives. \n \u2022 Level 3 - unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation.  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the investment. We expect most of the investments that will be held in the investment portfolio to fall into Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nValuation of Obligations under Participation Agreements\nWe have elected the fair value option under ASC Topic 825 - Financial Instruments relating to accounting for debt obligations at their fair value for obligations under participation agreements which arose due to partial loan sales which did not meet the criteria for sale treatment under ASC Topic 860. We employ the yield approach valuation methodology used for the real-estate related loan investments on our obligations under participation agreements. As of September 30, 2016, obligations under participation agreements at fair value totaled approximately $14.6 million and the fair value of the loans that are associated with these obligations under participation agreements is approximately $21.2 million. For the year ended September 30, 2016, there were no repayments on obligations under participation agreements. The weighted average interest rate on our obligations under participation agreements was approximately 13.9% as of September 30, 2016.\nRevenue Recognition\nSecurity transactions are accounted for on their trade date. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. We do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if there is reason to doubt the collectability of such income. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and such amounts are amortized into interest income as a yield adjustment using the effective interest method over the respective term of the loan. Upon the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and securities as interest income when we receive such amounts.\nOrganization Costs\nOrganization costs include, among other things, the cost of incorporating, including the cost of legal services and other fees pertaining to our organization. These costs are expensed as incurred. For the period from May 15, 2013 (inception) to September 30, 2016, we incurred cumulative organization costs totaling approximately $0.2 million, which were paid on behalf of us by Terra Income Advisors and have been recorded as a payable to it. For the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, we incurred approximately $0.1 million and $0.03 million of organization costs, respectively. We did not incur any organization costs for the year ended September 30, 2016.\nOffering Costs\nOur offering costs include, among other things, legal and printing costs pertaining to preparation of the initial registration statement and prospectus and registration fees relating to the Offering. All offering costs incurred during the offering period are\nrecorded as deferred charge and amortized over twelve months from the date the cost is incurred, with the exception of those costs that were incurred prior to the commencement of operations on June 24, 2015, which were amortized over a twelve month period from that date forward. For the period from our inception on May 15, 2013 to September 30, 2016, we incurred cumulative offering costs totaling approximately $2.2 million. For the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded approximately $1.3 million and $0.4 million of amortization of deferred offering costs, respectively.\nIncentive Fee on Capital Gains\nPursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee on capital gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of our incentive fee on capital gains, which equals the realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue (but do not pay) for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period. While the Investment Advisory Agreement neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we accrue for this incentive fee to include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to Terra Income Advisors if our entire portfolio were liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though Terra Income Advisors is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.\nFederal Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be taxed for federal income tax purposes, and to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders from our earnings and profits as determined for federal income tax purposes. To obtain and maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute annually at least 90.0% of our ordinary net income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any.\nRecognition of a tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax liabilities as income tax expense in the statement of operations. For the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not incur any interest or penalties.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. On April 20, 2015, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Terra Income Advisors in accordance with the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement became effective on June 24, 2015, the date that we met the Minimum Offering Requirement. Terra Income Advisors serves as our investment adviser in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Payments under the Investment Advisory Agreement in each reporting period will consist of (i) a base management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our average gross assets and (ii) an incentive fee based on our performance. Terra Income Advisors will be reimbursed for allocated administrative expenses incurred on our behalf. For the year ended September 30, 2016 and for the period from our commencement of operations on June 24, 2015 through September 30, 2015, we incurred approximately $0.6 million and $0.03 million, respectively, in base management fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. For the year ended September 30, 2016, we accrued incentive fees on capital gains of approximately $0.03 million, based on net unrealized capital gains of approximately $0.1 million. No incentive fees on capital gains are actually payable by us with respect to unrealized gains unless and until those gains are actually realized. There were no such fees for the year ended September 30, 2015.\nOn April 20, 2015, we entered into a dealer manager agreement (the Dealer Manager Agreement\u201d) with Terra Capital Markets, an affiliate of Terra Income Advisors, to serve as the dealer manager of the Offering. As dealer manager, Terra Capital Markets is responsible for marketing our shares being offered pursuant to the Offering. In this role, it will manage a group of selling dealers, including other unaffiliated broker-dealers who enter into Selected Dealer Arrangements with Terra Capital Markets. Terra Capital Markets received selling commissions, dealer manager fees and broker-dealer fees of 6.0%, 3.0% and 1.0%, respectively, of gross proceeds from the Offering, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers for marketing and expenses.\nOn April 19, 2016, the Board approved an amended and restated dealer manager agreement (the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement\u201d), which we adopted on April 27, 2016. Under the terms of the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, Terra Capital Markets receives selling commissions, dealer manager fees and broker-dealer fees of 3.0%, 1.5% and 1.0%, respectively, of gross proceeds from the Offering, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers for marketing and expenses. In addition, Terra Capital Markets receives a distribution fee at an annual rate of 1.125% of gross offering proceeds, excluding shares sold through the distribution reinvestment plan, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers for\nservices performed in connection with the distribution of our shares. The distribution fee is payable annually with respect to each share sold in the primary offering on the first, second, third, and fourth anniversaries of the month of purchase. In connection with the adoption of the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, Terra Capital Markets reimbursed us approximately $1.3 million for selling commissions and dealer manager fees we paid related to the shares sold on and prior to February 20, 2016, the last shareholder admittance date prior to the adoption of the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement. The reimbursement amount will be paid back to Terra Capital Markets on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the months of purchase.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately $3.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of broker-dealer commissions and fees and, of this amount, approximately $2.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, were re-allowed to selected broker-dealers. As of September 30, 2016, total distribution fee payable was approximately $2.2 million, as reflected on the statements of assets and liabilities. The following table reflects the payment schedule of the distribution fee payable:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period as of September 30, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution fee payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,191,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>580,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,160,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>450,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, we purchased a B-Note that provides for a total lending commitment of approximately $3.5 million. As of September 30, 2016, the unfunded commitment on this investment was approximately $0.4 million. We expect to fund this commitment in the next year.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. The amendments provide a definition of the term substantial doubt\u201d and include principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans. The amendments also require an evaluation every reporting period, including interim periods for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued), and certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated or not alleviated. The amendments in this update are effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016. We elected to early adopt ASU 2014-15 beginning October 1, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (ASC Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d). ASU 2015-02 significantly changes the consolidation analysis required under U.S. GAAP and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity guidance. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt ASU 2015-02 beginning October 1, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 beginning October 1, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d). ASU 2016-01 retains many current requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments; however, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (i) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (ii) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU 2016-01 also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted for public business entities. We are currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, a consensus of the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our financial statements and disclosures.\nRelated Party Transactions\nCompensation of Terra Income Advisors and Terra Capital Markets\nPursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay Terra Income Advisors a base management fee and an incentive fee. We commenced accruing fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement on June 24, 2015, upon commencement of our operations.\nThe base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.0% of our average gross assets. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The base management fee may or may not be taken in whole or in part at the discretion of Terra Income Advisors. All or any part of the base management fee not taken as to any quarter will be deferred without interest and may be taken in such other quarter as Terra Income Advisors shall determine. The base management fee for any partial month or quarter will be prorated for such partial period.\nThe incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part, which we refer to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon our pre-incentive fee net investment income\u201d for the immediately preceding quarter. The subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a quarterly hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital at the beginning of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 2.0% (8.0% annualized), subject to a catch-up\u201d feature. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income\u201d means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, other than fees for providing managerial assistance, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses reimbursed to Terra Income Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The calculation of the subordinated incentive fee on income for each quarter is as follows:\n \u2022 No incentive fee is payable to Terra Income Advisors in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 2.0% (8.0% annualized); \n \u2022 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to Terra Income Advisors, all or any portion of which may be waived or deferred in Terra Income Advisors' discretion. We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5%) as the catch-up.\u201d The catch-up\u201d provision is intended to provide Terra Income Advisors with an incentive fee of 20.0% on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income when our pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and \n \u2022 20.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to Terra Income Advisors once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved.  The second part of the incentive fee, which we refer to as the incentive fee on capital gains, is an incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments from the portfolio and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of our incentive fee on capital gains, which equals our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue (but do not pay) for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.\nWe reimburse Terra Income Advisors for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operation. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (i) Terra Income Advisors' actual costs incurred in providing such services and (ii) the amount that the Board, including a majority of our independent directors, estimates we would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. Terra Income Advisors is required to allocate the cost of such services to us based on objective factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Board then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements based on the breadth, depth and quality of such\nservices as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party providers known to be available. In addition, the Board considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Board compares the total amount paid to Terra Income Advisors for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse Terra Income Advisors for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of Terra Income Advisors.\nTerra Income Advisors has funded our offering costs and organization costs. Organization expenses are expensed on our statement of operations. All offering costs incurred during the offering period are recorded as deferred charge and amortized over twelve months from the date the cost is incurred, with the exception of those costs that were incurred prior to the commencement of operations on June 24, 2015, which are being amortized over a twelve month period from that date forward. Terra Income Advisors is responsible for the payment of our cumulative organization and offering expenses to the extent such expenses exceed 1.5% of the gross proceeds from the Offering, without recourse against or reimbursement by us. As a result, Terra Income Advisors will bear all organization and offering expenses in excess of 1.5% of the gross proceeds from the Offering. Through September 30, 2016, we believe that it is highly likely that we will raise sufficient funds to reimburse Terra Income Advisors in full for all cumulative organization and"}
