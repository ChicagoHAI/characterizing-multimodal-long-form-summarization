MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section of this report entitled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nPenumbra is a global healthcare company focused on innovative therapies. We design, develop, manufacture and market medical devices and have a broad portfolio of products that addresses challenging medical conditions and significant clinical needs across our major markets. Our team focuses on developing, manufacturing and marketing products for use by specialist physicians to drive improved clinical outcomes. We believe that the cost-effectiveness of our products is attractive to our hospital customers.\nSince our founding in 2004, we have invested heavily in our product development capabilities in our major markets: neuro and vascular. We have successfully developed, obtained regulatory clearance or approval for, and introduced products into the neurovascular market since 2007, vascular market since 2013 and neurosurgical market since 2014, respectively. We continue to expand our portfolio of product offerings, while developing and iterating on our currently available products.\nWe expect to continue to develop and build our portfolio of products, including our thrombectomy, embolization and access technologies. Generally, when we introduce a next generation product or a new product designed to replace a current product, sales of the earlier generation product or the product replaced decline. Our research and development activities are centered around the development of new products and clinical activities designed to support our regulatory submissions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our products. In addition to the development of thrombectomy, embolization and access technologies, in the second quarter of 2017, we formed MVI Health Inc. ( MVI\u201d), a privately-held joint venture, with Sixense Enterprises, Inc. ( Sixense\u201d) for the purpose of exploring healthcare applications of virtual reality technology. At the time MVI was formed, we held 50% of the issued and outstanding equity of MVI with Sixense holding the remaining 50%. On August 31, 2018, we acquired a 90% controlling interest in MVI and expect to continue to make investments to further develop MVI's technology which is currently in the development stage.\nWe sell our products to hospitals primarily through our direct sales organization in the United States, most of Europe, Canada and Australia, as well as through distributors in select international markets. In 2018, 34.7% of our revenue was generated from customers located outside of the United States. Our sales outside of the United States are denominated principally in the euro and Japanese yen, with some sales being denominated in other currencies. As a result, we have foreign exchange exposure, but do not currently engage in hedging.\nWe generated revenue of $444.9 million, $333.8 million and $263.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This represents annual increases of 33.3% and 26.8%, respectively.\nImpact of the MVI Asset Acquisition\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a $30.8 million in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d) charge in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in MVI which was accounted for as an asset acquisition. As a result of the IPR&D charge, we generated an operating loss of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This compared to an operating income of $1.2 million and operating loss $1.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our results are discussed in more detail in the Results of Operations section below.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nThere are a number of factors that have impacted, and we believe will continue to impact, our results of operations and growth. These factors include:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The rate at which we grow our salesforce and the speed at which newly hired salespeople become fully effective can impact our revenue growth or our costs incurred in anticipation of such growth.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our industry is intensely competitive and, in particular, we compete with a number of large, well-capitalized companies. We must continue to successfully compete in light of our competitors' existing and future products and their resources to successfully market to the specialist physicians who use our products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We must continue to successfully introduce new products that gain acceptance with specialist physicians and successfully transition from existing products to new products, ensuring adequate supply. In addition, as we introduce new products and expand our production capacity, we anticipate additional personnel will be hired and trained to build our inventory of components and finished goods in advance of sales, which may cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Publications of clinical results by us, our competitors and other third parties can have a significant influence on whether, and the degree to which, our products are used by specialist physicians and the procedures and treatments those physicians choose to administer for a given condition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The specialist physicians who use our products may not perform procedures during certain times of the year, such as those periods when they are at major medical conferences or are away from their practices for other reasons, the timing of which occurs irregularly during the year and from year to year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Most of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in the local currency of the country in which we sell our products. As a result, our revenue from international sales can be significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience meaningful variability in our quarterly revenue, gross profit and gross margin percentage as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the number of available selling days, which can be impacted by holidays; the mix of products sold; the geographic mix of where products are sold; the demand for our products and the products of our competitors; the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for products; increased competition; the timing of customer orders; inventory write-offs due to obsolescence; costs, benefits and timing of new product introductions; costs, benefits and timing of the acquisition and integration of businesses and product lines we may acquire; the availability and cost of components and raw materials; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We may experience quarters in which we have significant revenue growth sequentially followed by quarters of moderate or no revenue growth. Additionally, we may experience quarters in which operating expenses, in particular research and development expenses, fluctuate depending on the stage and timing of product development.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable periods. Management bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could materially change our results from those reported. Management evaluates its estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. However, if our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant areas where management applies judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is comprised of product revenue net of returns, discounts, administration fees and sales rebates. We adopted the guidance under Topic 606 of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. Therefore, the comparative prior year information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605 with the impact of the adoption reflected in opening retained earnings. As a result of adoption, the cumulative impact to our retained earnings at January 1, 2018 was $0.3 million.\nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue from product sales is recognized either on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer, but is deferred for certain transactions when control has not yet transferred. With respect to products that we consign to hospitals, which primarily consist of coils, we recognize revenue at the time hospitals utilize products in a procedure. The implementation of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on the measurement or recognition of revenue from prior periods, however additional\ndisclosures have been added in accordance with the guidance. Refer to Note 14. Revenues\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information and disclosures on our revenue.\nWe defer revenue for amounts that we have already invoiced our customers for and are ultimately expected to be recognized as revenue, but for which not all revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nRevenue is recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration such as product returns utilizing historical return rates, rebates, discounts, and other adjustments to net revenue. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price. Variable consideration is included in revenue only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made no changes in estimates for variable consideration.\nOur terms and conditions permit product returns and exchanges. We base our estimates for sales returns on actual historical returns over the prior three years and they are recorded as reductions in revenue at the time of sale. Upon recognition, we reduce revenue and cost of revenue for the estimated return. Return rates can fluctuate over time, but are sufficiently predictable to allow us to estimate expected future product returns.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets ( DTAs\u201d) to their estimated realizable value.\nThe calculation of our DTAs involves the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments while taking into account estimates of the amounts and type of future taxable income. DTAs are reduced to their estimated realizable value by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the DTAs will not be achieved. Valuation allowances related to DTAs can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates, and projections of future taxable income.\nThe calculation of our current provision for income taxes involves the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments while taking into account current tax laws, interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future tax audits. We have established reserves to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Although we believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments to be reasonable, any changes in tax law or interpretation of tax law and the resolutions of potential tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe follow FASB ASC 740-10 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\u201d that prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our income tax returns, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalty accrual, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure requirements. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, ( the Tax Reform Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, including but not limited to, lowering our U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a one-time transition tax on previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, and creating new taxes on foreign sourced earnings. Also on December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) which provides guidance on accounting for tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. SAB 118 provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Reform Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Reform Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for tax effects of the Tax Reform Act under ASC 740 and therefore our financial statements reflect estimates of the tax affects based on current interpretations of the authoritative guidance available to date. In the reporting period ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an adjustment for the reduction of our U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a decrease to our DTAs in the amount of $15.4 million with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. No adjustments related to the federal tax rate reduction were made to our DTA balance subsequent to December 31, 2017. In the reporting period ended December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for the one-time transition tax on the cumulative value of foreign earnings and profits that were previously not repatriated for U.S. income tax purposes, and completed our analysis of the new global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d)\ninclusion attributable to foreign sourced earnings. The tax effects of the one-time transition tax and GILTI income inclusion did not have a material impact on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. We include U.S. taxes due on income inclusions attributable to GILTI as a period cost in the tax year incurred. Not all provisions of the Tax Reform Act are applicable to us in the tax year ended December 31, 2018. For example, we do not meet the statutory gross receipts threshold and therefore are not subject to the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse ( BEAT\u201d) minimum tax, and, due to current year losses we are not entitled to the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income ( FDII\u201d) deduction provisions.\nThe final impact of the Tax Reform Act may differ from our current estimates, due to, among other things, additional legislative guidance that may be issued which could change our current interpretation or application of the new tax law.\nSignificant domestic DTAs were generated in recent years, primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $100.0 million, $88.7 million and $0.7 million of federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we had research credits available to offset federal and state tax liabilities in the amount of $6.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively. The federal tax credits will begin to expire in 2024. California state tax credits have no expiration.\nWe assess the ability to realize the benefits of our DTAs in each reporting period by evaluating all available positive and negative evidence, objective and subjective in nature, including (1) cumulative results of operations in recent years, (2) sources of recent pre-tax income, (3) estimates of future taxable income, (4) the length of net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforward periods, and (5) the ability to carry back losses to prior years. We also measure our current DTA balances against estimates of future income based on objectively verifiable operating results from the Company's recent history.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our net DTA balance was $30.9 million, after reduction of a valuation allowance of $17.3 million. We do not maintain valuation allowances against any of our foreign DTAs as we believe, at the required more-likely-than-not level of certainty, that our foreign subsidiaries will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of their DTAs in full. In the period ended December 31, 2018, we measured our domestic net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) DTA balances against projections of future taxable income with consideration of relevant provisions of the Tax Reform Act, including but not limited to, the indefinite carryforward period for NOLs generated in years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. We also considered our three year cumulative income position, exclusive of the impact of excess tax deductions from stock-based compensation. We concluded that sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the benefit of our domestic NOLs in full.\nThe Tax Reform Act extended the carryforward period of net operating losses generated in tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 such that the losses may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limitation of 80% of taxable income. The tax attribute ordering rules provide that to offset taxable income, net operating losses must be used in full prior to the utilization of tax credits. Accordingly, our federal research and development tax credit DTAs, which have a 20 year carryforward period, is expected to expire prior to utilization based on future projected taxable income.\nAfter an evaluation of all available qualitative and quantitative evidence, both positive and negative in nature, we concluded that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the benefits of our domestic DTAs prior to expiration, other than our federal research and development tax credit DTAs which are expected to expire before their utilization. As a result, in the period ended December 31, 2018, we continued to record a valuation allowance against our federal research and development tax credit. In addition, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our California DTAs.\nOur DTA balance also includes $3.0 million of tax attributes gained upon acquisition of a majority interest ownership in MVI. Refer to Note 3. Investments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments\u201d for more information on the MVI Transfer Agreement. The acquired NOL DTAs are subject to Separate Return Limitation Year ( SRLY\u201d) rules which will limit the utilization of pre-acquisition tax attributes to offset future taxable income solely generated by MVI. As of December 31, 2018, we could not conclude, at the required more-likely-than-not level of certainty, that MVI will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of its tax attributes prior to expiration and so a $3.0 million valuation allowance was recorded against the DTAs acquired from MVI.\nWe will continue to closely monitor the need for a valuation allowance against current and additional DTAs generated in each subsequent reporting period. The need for a valuation allowance can be impacted by actual operating results, forecasted financial performance, and variances between the two, and the rate at which future DTAs are generated. If our management was to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net DTAs in the future, a valuation allowance related charge to earnings would be reflected in that period, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. If our management was to determine that we would be able to realize all net DTAs in the future, a\nreduction of the valuation allowance would be reflected as a benefit to earnings in that period, which could have a material positive impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business or assets over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may no longer be recoverable and that an impairment loss may have occurred. Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, change in customers, target market and strategy, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel, or change in reporting units. We operate as one segment, which is considered to be the sole reporting unit, and therefore goodwill is tested for impairment at the consolidated level.\nThe authoritative guidance allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If an entity determines that as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not (i.e. greater than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate and compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgments, including: identification of the reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, a qualitative assessment to determine whether there are any impairment indicators, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, cost factors, and entity specific factors such as strategies, overall financial performance (both current and projected) and market capitalization. In the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017, we performed qualitative assessments for goodwill impairment and determined there we no indicators of impairment. Refer to Note 7. Goodwill\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nValuation of Intangible Assets\nThe valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisitions are determined based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. In determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets, management provides its best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Certain estimates used in this process include the amount and timing of projected milestone-based payments on sales that are considered probable and estimable, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each acquired intangible asset, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. In conducting the annual impairment test for its indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (greater than 50% likelihood) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. In accordance with the authoritative guidance, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test to compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying amount. If we perform the quantitative test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally use a discounted cash flow method based on the present value of projected cash flows to estimate fair value. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts and discounted using a rate that is reflective of the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the projected cash flows of the business. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar analysis and valuations. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations may impact our projected cash flows, which could result in a potential impairment charge to the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed a quantitative impairment analysis on our indefinite-lived intangible asset and determined that the asset was not impaired. Refer to Note 6. Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nFinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets, which is the period during which expected cash flows support the fair value of such intangible assets. We review finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such an event occurs, management determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to the related asset group's carrying value. If an asset is considered impaired, the asset will be written down to the determined fair value based on discounted cash flows. We also periodically review the useful lives assigned to our\nintangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the underlying intangible asset. If a change were to occur in any of the above-mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase.\nValuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities\nCertain agreements the Company enters into, including business combinations, involve the potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon certain performance and revenue milestones being achieved. Contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date at fair value and is remeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs with the change in fair value recognized within sales, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of our contingent consideration is determined using a Monte-Carlo valuation model that simulates outcomes based on management estimates. Significant increases or decreases in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities can result from a number of factors, including changes in the timing and amount of projected revenue, our estimates of the likelihood of achieving certain milestones, as well as changes in discount periods and rates.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue. We sell our products directly to hospitals and through distributors for use in procedures performed by specialist physicians to treat patients in two key markets: neuro and vascular disease. We sell our products through purchase orders, and we do not have long term purchase commitments from our customers. Revenue from product sales is recognized either on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer, but is deferred for certain transactions when control has not yet transferred. With respect to products that we consign to hospitals, which primarily consist of coils, we recognize revenue at the time hospitals utilize products in a procedure. Revenue also includes shipping and handling costs that we charge to customers.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, inbound freight charges, receiving costs, inspection and testing costs, warehousing costs, royalty expense, shipping and handling costs and other labor and overhead costs incurred in the manufacturing of products. We manufacture substantially all of our products in our manufacturing facility at our campus in Alameda, California.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d). R&D expenses primarily consist of product development, clinical and regulatory expenses, materials, depreciation and other costs associated with the development of our products. R&D expenses also include salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel and consultants. We expense R&D costs as they are incurred.\nSales, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d). SG&A expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel and consultants engaged in sales, marketing, finance, legal, compliance, administrative, facilities and information technology and human resource activities. Our SG&A expenses also include marketing trials, medical education, training, commissions, generally based on a percentage of sales, to direct sales representatives, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs.\nIncome Tax Expense. We are taxed at the rates applicable within each jurisdiction in which we operate. The composite income tax rate, tax provisions, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities, and require us to exercise judgment in determining our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and the potential valuation allowance recorded against our net DTAs. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the DTAs will not be achieved.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth

Our revenue growth resulted from further market penetration of our existing products and sales of new products. Increased sales within our neuro and vascular businesses accounted for approximately 55% and 45% of the revenue increase, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenue from our neuro products increased $61.9 million, or 26.6%, to $294.3 million in 2018, from $232.4 million in 2017. This was primarily attributable to increased sales of our Penumbra System and neuro access products, which accounted for approximately 85% and slightly less than 20% of the neuro revenue increase, respectively. Our neuro product sales experienced strong momentum due to further market penetration and growth in the market for endovascular treatment of stroke, which led to an increase in the number of procedures performed by specialist physicians using these products. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in sales of our neuro embolization products, which decreased by slightly less than 5% of the total change in neuro revenue, as demand for our neuro embolization products fluctuates from period to period due to the number of procedures performed. Prices for our neuro products remained substantially unchanged during the period.\nRevenue from our vascular products increased $49.3 million, or 48.6%, to $150.6 million in 2018, from $101.3 million in 2017. This was primarily attributable to increased sales of our Indigo System products, which accounted for slightly more than 45% of the vascular revenue increase for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was driven by further market penetration which led to increases in the number of procedures performed by specialist physicians using our products.

Our effective tax rate changed to (273.8)% in 2018, compared to (145.8)% in 2017. The tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation associated with our US jurisdiction, offset by income taxes attributable to our foreign jurisdictions and a tax charge resulting from the IPR&D expense associated with the acquisition of a controlling interest in MVI, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation associated with our US jurisdiction, offset by income taxes attributable to our foreign jurisdictions, establishing a valuation allowance against our federal research and development tax credit deferred tax asset, and an adjustment to deferred income tax expense due to the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate pursuant to the Tax Reform Act.\nOur effective tax rate is driven by (1) permanent differences in taxable income for tax and financial reporting purposes, (2) tax expense attributable to our foreign jurisdictions, (3) changes to the valuation allowance maintained against our deferred tax assets, and (4) discrete tax adjustments such as excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our income tax provision is subject to volatility as the amount of excess tax benefits can fluctuate from period to period based on the price of our stock, the volume of share-based grants settled or vested, and the fair value assigned to equity awards under U.S. GAAP. In\naddition, changes in tax law or our interpretation thereof, and changes to our valuation allowance could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except for percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Neuro\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vascular\n</td> <td>101,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue increased $70.4 million, or 26.8%, to $333.8 million in 2017, from $263.3 million in 2016.

Our effective tax rate changed to (145.8)% in 2017, compared to 1,805.1% in 2016. Our effective rate for 2017 and 2016 includes excess tax benefits attributable to stock-based compensation recognized in our income tax provision due to the retroactive adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation associated with our US jurisdiction, offset by income taxes attributable to our foreign jurisdictions, establishing a valuation allowance against our federal research and development tax credit deferred tax asset, and an adjustment to deferred income tax expense due to the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate pursuant to the Tax Reform Act. The tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation associated with our US jurisdiction, offset by income taxes attributable to our foreign jurisdictions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $344.7 million in working capital, which included $67.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $133.0 million in marketable investments. As of December 31, 2018, we held approximately 34.5% of our cash and cash equivalents in foreign entities.\nIn March 2017, we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,495,000 shares of our common stock at public offering price of $76.00 per share, less the underwriters' discounts and commissions, pursuant to an underwritten public offering. We received approximately $106.3 million in net cash proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.8 million and other offering expenses of $0.5 million. We will continue to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, continued development of our products, including research and development and clinical trials, potential acquisitions and other business opportunities. Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering, we are investing the net proceeds in investment grade, interest bearing securities.\nIn addition to our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable investment balances, our principal source of liquidity is our accounts receivable. We believe these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our principal liquidity requirements are to fund our operations, which includes, but is not limited to, maintaining sufficient levels of inventory to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, funding research and development activities and funding our capital expenditures. We may also lease or purchase additional facilities to facilitate our growth. We expect to continue to make investments as we launch new products, expand our manufacturing operations and further expand into international markets. We may, however, require or elect to secure additional financing as we continue to execute our business strategy. If we require or elect to raise additional funds, we may do so through equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, could result in dilution to our stockholders and could require us to agree to covenants that limit our operating flexibility.\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, marketable investments and selected working capital data as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketable investments\n</td> <td>133,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td>81,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>8,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued liabilities\n</td> <td>57,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital(1)\n</td> <td>344,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>330,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Working capital consists of total current assets less total current liabilities.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents, net cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities and our ending balance of cash and cash equivalents:\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>28,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,807\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>(385\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77,653\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(9,815\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td>67,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by and used in operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items (including depreciation and amortization, accretion of discounts or amortization of premium on marketable investments, stock-based compensation expense, loss on non-marketable equity investments, provision for doubtful accounts, inventory write-offs and write-downs, changes in deferred tax balances, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired IPR&D charges), and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.8 million in 2018 and consisted of net income of $2.9 million and non-cash items of $56.2 million offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $30.3 million.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section of this report entitled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nPenumbra is a global healthcare company focused on innovative therapies. We design, develop, manufacture and market medical devices and have a broad portfolio of products that addresses challenging medical conditions and significant clinical needs across our major markets. Our team focuses on developing, manufacturing and marketing products for use by specialist physicians to drive improved clinical outcomes. We believe that the cost-effectiveness of our products is attractive to our hospital customers.\nSince our founding in 2004, we have invested heavily in our product development capabilities in our major markets: neuro and vascular. We have successfully developed, obtained regulatory clearance or approval for, and introduced products into the neurovascular market since 2007, vascular market since 2013 and neurosurgical market since 2014, respectively. We continue to expand our portfolio of product offerings, while developing and iterating on our currently available products.\nWe expect to continue to develop and build our portfolio of products, including our thrombectomy, embolization and access technologies. Generally, when we introduce a next generation product or a new product designed to replace a current product, sales of the earlier generation product or the product replaced decline. Our research and development activities are centered around the development of new products and clinical activities designed to support our regulatory submissions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our products. In addition to the development of thrombectomy, embolization and access technologies, in the second quarter of 2017, we formed MVI Health Inc. ( MVI\u201d), a privately-held joint venture, with Sixense Enterprises, Inc. ( Sixense\u201d) for the purpose of exploring healthcare applications of virtual reality technology. At the time MVI was formed, we held 50% of the issued and outstanding equity of MVI with Sixense holding the remaining 50%. On August 31, 2018, we acquired a 90% controlling interest in MVI and expect to continue to make investments to further develop MVI's technology which is currently in the development stage.\nWe sell our products to hospitals primarily through our direct sales organization in the United States, most of Europe, Canada and Australia, as well as through distributors in select international markets. In 2018, 34.7% of our revenue was generated from customers located outside of the United States. Our sales outside of the United States are denominated principally in the euro and Japanese yen, with some sales being denominated in other currencies. As a result, we have foreign exchange exposure, but do not currently engage in hedging.\nWe generated revenue of $444.9 million, $333.8 million and $263.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This represents annual increases of 33.3% and 26.8%, respectively.\nImpact of the MVI Asset Acquisition\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a $30.8 million in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d) charge in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in MVI which was accounted for as an asset acquisition. As a result of the IPR&D charge, we generated an operating loss of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This compared to an operating income of $1.2 million and operating loss $1.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our results are discussed in more detail in the Results of Operations section below.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nThere are a number of factors that have impacted, and we believe will continue to impact, our results of operations and growth. These factors include:\n \u2022 The rate at which we grow our salesforce and the speed at which newly hired salespeople become fully effective can impact our revenue growth or our costs incurred in anticipation of such growth. \n \u2022 Our industry is intensely competitive and, in particular, we compete with a number of large, well-capitalized companies. We must continue to successfully compete in light of our competitors' existing and future products and their resources to successfully market to the specialist physicians who use our products. \n \u2022 We must continue to successfully introduce new products that gain acceptance with specialist physicians and successfully transition from existing products to new products, ensuring adequate supply. In addition, as we introduce new products and expand our production capacity, we anticipate additional personnel will be hired and trained to build our inventory of components and finished goods in advance of sales, which may cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition. \n \u2022 Publications of clinical results by us, our competitors and other third parties can have a significant influence on whether, and the degree to which, our products are used by specialist physicians and the procedures and treatments those physicians choose to administer for a given condition. \n \u2022 The specialist physicians who use our products may not perform procedures during certain times of the year, such as those periods when they are at major medical conferences or are away from their practices for other reasons, the timing of which occurs irregularly during the year and from year to year. \n \u2022 Most of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in the local currency of the country in which we sell our products. As a result, our revenue from international sales can be significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience meaningful variability in our quarterly revenue, gross profit and gross margin percentage as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the number of available selling days, which can be impacted by holidays; the mix of products sold; the geographic mix of where products are sold; the demand for our products and the products of our competitors; the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for products; increased competition; the timing of customer orders; inventory write-offs due to obsolescence; costs, benefits and timing of new product introductions; costs, benefits and timing of the acquisition and integration of businesses and product lines we may acquire; the availability and cost of components and raw materials; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We may experience quarters in which we have significant revenue growth sequentially followed by quarters of moderate or no revenue growth. Additionally, we may experience quarters in which operating expenses, in particular research and development expenses, fluctuate depending on the stage and timing of product development.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable periods. Management bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could materially change our results from those reported. Management evaluates its estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. However, if our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant areas where management applies judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is comprised of product revenue net of returns, discounts, administration fees and sales rebates. We adopted the guidance under Topic 606 of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. Therefore, the comparative prior year information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605 with the impact of the adoption reflected in opening retained earnings. As a result of adoption, the cumulative impact to our retained earnings at January 1, 2018 was $0.3 million.\nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue from product sales is recognized either on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer, but is deferred for certain transactions when control has not yet transferred. With respect to products that we consign to hospitals, which primarily consist of coils, we recognize revenue at the time hospitals utilize products in a procedure. The implementation of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on the measurement or recognition of revenue from prior periods, however additional\ndisclosures have been added in accordance with the guidance. Refer to Note 14. Revenues\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information and disclosures on our revenue.\nWe defer revenue for amounts that we have already invoiced our customers for and are ultimately expected to be recognized as revenue, but for which not all revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nRevenue is recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration such as product returns utilizing historical return rates, rebates, discounts, and other adjustments to net revenue. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price. Variable consideration is included in revenue only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made no changes in estimates for variable consideration.\nOur terms and conditions permit product returns and exchanges. We base our estimates for sales returns on actual historical returns over the prior three years and they are recorded as reductions in revenue at the time of sale. Upon recognition, we reduce revenue and cost of revenue for the estimated return. Return rates can fluctuate over time, but are sufficiently predictable to allow us to estimate expected future product returns.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets ( DTAs\u201d) to their estimated realizable value.\nThe calculation of our DTAs involves the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments while taking into account estimates of the amounts and type of future taxable income. DTAs are reduced to their estimated realizable value by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the DTAs will not be achieved. Valuation allowances related to DTAs can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates, and projections of future taxable income.\nThe calculation of our current provision for income taxes involves the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments while taking into account current tax laws, interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future tax audits. We have established reserves to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Although we believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments to be reasonable, any changes in tax law or interpretation of tax law and the resolutions of potential tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe follow FASB ASC 740-10 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\u201d that prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our income tax returns, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalty accrual, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure requirements. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, ( the Tax Reform Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, including but not limited to, lowering our U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a one-time transition tax on previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, and creating new taxes on foreign sourced earnings. Also on December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) which provides guidance on accounting for tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. SAB 118 provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Reform Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Reform Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for tax effects of the Tax Reform Act under ASC 740 and therefore our financial statements reflect estimates of the tax affects based on current interpretations of the authoritative guidance available to date. In the reporting period ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an adjustment for the reduction of our U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a decrease to our DTAs in the amount of $15.4 million with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. No adjustments related to the federal tax rate reduction were made to our DTA balance subsequent to December 31, 2017. In the reporting period ended December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for the one-time transition tax on the cumulative value of foreign earnings and profits that were previously not repatriated for U.S. income tax purposes, and completed our analysis of the new global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d)\ninclusion attributable to foreign sourced earnings. The tax effects of the one-time transition tax and GILTI income inclusion did not have a material impact on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. We include U.S. taxes due on income inclusions attributable to GILTI as a period cost in the tax year incurred. Not all provisions of the Tax Reform Act are applicable to us in the tax year ended December 31, 2018. For example, we do not meet the statutory gross receipts threshold and therefore are not subject to the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse ( BEAT\u201d) minimum tax, and, due to current year losses we are not entitled to the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income ( FDII\u201d) deduction provisions.\nThe final impact of the Tax Reform Act may differ from our current estimates, due to, among other things, additional legislative guidance that may be issued which could change our current interpretation or application of the new tax law.\nSignificant domestic DTAs were generated in recent years, primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $100.0 million, $88.7 million and $0.7 million of federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we had research credits available to offset federal and state tax liabilities in the amount of $6.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively. The federal tax credits will begin to expire in 2024. California state tax credits have no expiration.\nWe assess the ability to realize the benefits of our DTAs in each reporting period by evaluating all available positive and negative evidence, objective and subjective in nature, including (1) cumulative results of operations in recent years, (2) sources of recent pre-tax income, (3) estimates of future taxable income, (4) the length of net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforward periods, and (5) the ability to carry back losses to prior years. We also measure our current DTA balances against estimates of future income based on objectively verifiable operating results from the Company's recent history.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our net DTA balance was $30.9 million, after reduction of a valuation allowance of $17.3 million. We do not maintain valuation allowances against any of our foreign DTAs as we believe, at the required more-likely-than-not level of certainty, that our foreign subsidiaries will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of their DTAs in full. In the period ended December 31, 2018, we measured our domestic net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) DTA balances against projections of future taxable income with consideration of relevant provisions of the Tax Reform Act, including but not limited to, the indefinite carryforward period for NOLs generated in years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. We also considered our three year cumulative income position, exclusive of the impact of excess tax deductions from stock-based compensation. We concluded that sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the benefit of our domestic NOLs in full.\nThe Tax Reform Act extended the carryforward period of net operating losses generated in tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 such that the losses may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limitation of 80% of taxable income. The tax attribute ordering rules provide that to offset taxable income, net operating losses must be used in full prior to the utilization of tax credits. Accordingly, our federal research and development tax credit DTAs, which have a 20 year carryforward period, is expected to expire prior to utilization based on future projected taxable income.\nAfter an evaluation of all available qualitative and quantitative evidence, both positive and negative in nature, we concluded that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the benefits of our domestic DTAs prior to expiration, other than our federal research and development tax credit DTAs which are expected to expire before their utilization. As a result, in the period ended December 31, 2018, we continued to record a valuation allowance against our federal research and development tax credit. In addition, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our California DTAs.\nOur DTA balance also includes $3.0 million of tax attributes gained upon acquisition of a majority interest ownership in MVI. Refer to Note 3. Investments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments\u201d for more information on the MVI Transfer Agreement. The acquired NOL DTAs are subject to Separate Return Limitation Year ( SRLY\u201d) rules which will limit the utilization of pre-acquisition tax attributes to offset future taxable income solely generated by MVI. As of December 31, 2018, we could not conclude, at the required more-likely-than-not level of certainty, that MVI will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of its tax attributes prior to expiration and so a $3.0 million valuation allowance was recorded against the DTAs acquired from MVI.\nWe will continue to closely monitor the need for a valuation allowance against current and additional DTAs generated in each subsequent reporting period. The need for a valuation allowance can be impacted by actual operating results, forecasted financial performance, and variances between the two, and the rate at which future DTAs are generated. If our management was to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net DTAs in the future, a valuation allowance related charge to earnings would be reflected in that period, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. If our management was to determine that we would be able to realize all net DTAs in the future, a\nreduction of the valuation allowance would be reflected as a benefit to earnings in that period, which could have a material positive impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business or assets over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may no longer be recoverable and that an impairment loss may have occurred. Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, change in customers, target market and strategy, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel, or change in reporting units. We operate as one segment, which is considered to be the sole reporting unit, and therefore goodwill is tested for impairment at the consolidated level.\nThe authoritative guidance allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If an entity determines that as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not (i.e. greater than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate and compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgments, including: identification of the reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, a qualitative assessment to determine whether there are any impairment indicators, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, cost factors, and entity specific factors such as strategies, overall financial performance (both current and projected) and market capitalization. In the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017, we performed qualitative assessments for goodwill impairment and determined there we no indicators of impairment. Refer to Note 7. Goodwill\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nValuation of Intangible Assets\nThe valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisitions are determined based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. In determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets, management provides its best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Certain estimates used in this process include the amount and timing of projected milestone-based payments on sales that are considered probable and estimable, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each acquired intangible asset, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. In conducting the annual impairment test for its indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (greater than 50% likelihood) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. In accordance with the authoritative guidance, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test to compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying amount. If we perform the quantitative test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally use a discounted cash flow method based on the present value of projected cash flows to estimate fair value. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts and discounted using a rate that is reflective of the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the projected cash flows of the business. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar analysis and valuations. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations may impact our projected cash flows, which could result in a potential impairment charge to the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed a quantitative impairment analysis on our indefinite-lived intangible asset and determined that the asset was not impaired. Refer to Note 6. Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nFinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets, which is the period during which expected cash flows support the fair value of such intangible assets. We review finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such an event occurs, management determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to the related asset group's carrying value. If an asset is considered impaired, the asset will be written down to the determined fair value based on discounted cash flows. We also periodically review the useful lives assigned to our\nintangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the underlying intangible asset. If a change were to occur in any of the above-mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase.\nValuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities\nCertain agreements the Company enters into, including business combinations, involve the potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon certain performance and revenue milestones being achieved. Contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date at fair value and is remeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs with the change in fair value recognized within sales, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of our contingent consideration is determined using a Monte-Carlo valuation model that simulates outcomes based on management estimates. Significant increases or decreases in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities can result from a number of factors, including changes in the timing and amount of projected revenue, our estimates of the likelihood of achieving certain milestones, as well as changes in discount periods and rates.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue. We sell our products directly to hospitals and through distributors for use in procedures performed by specialist physicians to treat patients in two key markets: neuro and vascular disease. We sell our products through purchase orders, and we do not have long term purchase commitments from our customers. Revenue from product sales is recognized either on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer, but is deferred for certain transactions when control has not yet transferred. With respect to products that we consign to hospitals, which primarily consist of coils, we recognize revenue at the time hospitals utilize products in a procedure. Revenue also includes shipping and handling costs that we charge to customers.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, inbound freight charges, receiving costs, inspection and testing costs, warehousing costs, royalty expense, shipping and handling costs and other labor and overhead costs incurred in the manufacturing of products. We manufacture substantially all of our products in our manufacturing facility at our campus in Alameda, California.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d). R&D expenses primarily consist of product development, clinical and regulatory expenses, materials, depreciation and other costs associated with the development of our products. R&D expenses also include salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel and consultants. We expense R&D costs as they are incurred.\nSales, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d). SG&A expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel and consultants engaged in sales, marketing, finance, legal, compliance, administrative, facilities and information technology and human resource activities. Our SG&A expenses also include marketing trials, medical education, training, commissions, generally based on a percentage of sales, to direct sales representatives, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs.\nIncome Tax Expense. We are taxed at the rates applicable within each jurisdiction in which we operate. The composite income tax rate, tax provisions, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities, and require us to exercise judgment in determining our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and the potential valuation allowance recorded against our net DTAs. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the DTAs will not be achieved.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue\n\nRevenue increased $111.2 million, or 33.3%, to $444.9 million in 2018, from $333.8 million in 2017. Our revenue growth resulted from further market penetration of our existing products and sales of new products. Increased sales within our neuro and vascular businesses accounted for approximately 55% and 45% of the revenue increase, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenue from our neuro products increased $61.9 million, or 26.6%, to $294.3 million in 2018, from $232.4 million in 2017. This was primarily attributable to increased sales of our Penumbra System and neuro access products, which accounted for approximately 85% and slightly less than 20% of the neuro revenue increase, respectively. Our neuro product sales experienced strong momentum due to further market penetration and growth in the market for endovascular treatment of stroke, which led to an increase in the number of procedures performed by specialist physicians using these products. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in sales of our neuro embolization products, which decreased by slightly less than 5% of the total change in neuro revenue, as demand for our neuro embolization products fluctuates from period to period due to the number of procedures performed. Prices for our neuro products remained substantially unchanged during the period.\nRevenue from our vascular products increased $49.3 million, or 48.6%, to $150.6 million in 2018, from $101.3 million in 2017. This was primarily attributable to increased sales of our Indigo System products, which accounted for slightly more than 45% of the vascular revenue increase for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was driven by further market penetration which led to increases in the number of procedures performed by specialist physicians using our products. Prices for our vascular products remained substantially unchanged during the period.\nRevenue by Geographic Area\nThe following table presents revenue by geographic area and from countries that exceeded 10% of our total revenue, based on our customers' shipping destinations:\n\nRevenue from sales in international markets increased $39.6 million, or 34.6%, to $154.2 million in 2018, from $114.6 million in 2017. Revenue from international sales represented 34.7% and 34.3% of our total revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGross Margin\n\nGross margin increased by 0.6 percentage points percentage points to 65.7% in 2018, from 65.1% in 2017. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a more favorable product and geographic mix.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d)\n\nR&D expenses increased by $4.5 million or 14.2%, to $36.2 million in 2018, from $31.7 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $4.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses primarily due to an increase in headcount to support our growth and a $3.2 million increase in product development and testing costs. This was partially offset by a $2.5 million decrease in clinical trial costs and a $0.8 million decrease in consultant and contractor expenses.\nWe have made investments, and plan to continue to make investments, in the development of our products, which includes hiring additional research and development employees. We expect our R&D expenditures in 2019 to significantly increase over 2018 levels due to the full year inclusion of R&D expenses from the acquisition of a controlling interest in MVI on August 31, 2018. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience in the future, variability in expenses incurred due to the timing and costs of clinical trials.\nSales, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d)\n\nSG&A expenses increased by $42.1 million, or 22.8%, to $226.4 million in 2018, from $184.3 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $30.8 million increase in personnel-related expenses driven by an increase in headcount to support our growth, a $3.5 million increase in travel-related expenses, a $1.2 million increase related to a benefit recorded in the third quarter of the prior year due to a net refund of previously paid medical device excise tax, and a $1.0 million increase in information technology expenses.\nAs we continue to invest in our growth, we have expanded and expect to continue to expand our sales, marketing, general and administrative teams through the hiring of additional employees. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience in the future, variability in expenses incurred due to the timing and costs of investments in infrastructure to support the business. Further, while the medical device excise tax was suspended for an additional two-year period commencing January 1, 2018, absent further legislative action, it will be reinstated in 2020.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $30.8 million acquired IPR&D charge in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in MVI which was accounted for as an asset acquisition.\nBenefit from Income Taxes\n\nOur benefit from income taxes increased $0.8 million, to a benefit of $4.4 million in 2018, from a benefit of $3.6 million in 2017. Our effective tax rate changed to (273.8)% in 2018, compared to (145.8)% in 2017. The tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation associated with our US jurisdiction, offset by income taxes attributable to our foreign jurisdictions and a tax charge resulting from the IPR&D expense associated with the acquisition of a controlling interest in MVI, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation associated with our US jurisdiction, offset by income taxes attributable to our foreign jurisdictions, establishing a valuation allowance against our federal research and development tax credit deferred tax asset, and an adjustment to deferred income tax expense due to the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate pursuant to the Tax Reform Act.\nOur effective tax rate is driven by (1) permanent differences in taxable income for tax and financial reporting purposes, (2) tax expense attributable to our foreign jurisdictions, (3) changes to the valuation allowance maintained against our deferred tax assets, and (4) discrete tax adjustments such as excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our income tax provision is subject to volatility as the amount of excess tax benefits can fluctuate from period to period based on the price of our stock, the volume of share-based grants settled or vested, and the fair value assigned to equity awards under U.S. GAAP. In\naddition, changes in tax law or our interpretation thereof, and changes to our valuation allowance could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\n\nRevenue increased $70.4 million, or 26.8%, to $333.8 million in 2017, from $263.3 million in 2016. Our revenue growth resulted from further market penetration of our existing products and sales of new products or products with new indications. Increased sales within our neuro and vascular businesses accounted for approximately two-thirds and one-third of the revenue increase, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue from our neuro products increased $46.9 million, or 25.3%, to $232.4 million in 2017, from $185.5 million in 2016. This was primarily attributable to increased sales of our Penumbra System and neuro access products, which accounted for approximately 70% and 20% of the neuro revenue increase, respectively. Our neuro product sales experienced strong momentum due to further market penetration and growth in the market for endovascular treatment of stroke. The overall market growth has led to increases in the number of procedures performed by specialist physicians using our products. Further, there was a greater demand for our neuro access products due to the number of procedures performed. Prices for our neuro products remained substantially unchanged during the period.\nRevenue from our vascular products increased $23.5 million, or 30.3%, to $101.3 million in 2017, from $77.8 million in 2016. This was primarily attributable to increased sales of our Indigo System products, which accounted for approximately half of the vascular revenue increase for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was driven by further market penetration which led to increases in the number of procedures performed by specialist physicians using our products. Prices for our vascular products remained substantially unchanged during the period.\nRevenue by Geographic Area\nThe following table presents revenue by geographic area and from countries that exceeded 10% of our total revenue, based on our customers' shipping destinations:\n\nRevenue from sales in international markets increased $27.4 million, or 31.4%, to $114.6 million in 2017, from $87.2 million in 2016. Revenue from international sales represented 34.3% and 33.1% of our total revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGross Margin\n\nGross margin remained relatively flat, increasing by 0.2 percentage points to 65.1% in 2017, from 64.9% in 2016.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d)\n\nR&D expenses increased by $7.8 million, or 32.6%, to $31.7 million in 2017, from $23.9 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $5.8 million increase in product development, testing and clinical trial costs and a $2.8 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to an increase in headcount. This was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in consultant, contractor and outside service costs.\nSales, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d)\n\nSG&A expenses increased by $36.0 million, or 24.3%, to $184.3 million in 2017, from $148.3 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $31.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses largely attributable to an increase in headcount to support our growth and a $2.3 million increase related to marketing events. This was partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease related to a benefit from a net refund of previously paid medical device excise tax.\nBenefit from Income Taxes\n\nOur benefit from income taxes decreased $12.1 million, to a benefit of $3.6 million in 2017, from a benefit of $15.7 million in 2016. Our effective tax rate changed to (145.8)% in 2017, compared to 1,805.1% in 2016. Our effective rate for 2017 and 2016 includes excess tax benefits attributable to stock-based compensation recognized in our income tax provision due to the retroactive adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation associated with our US jurisdiction, offset by income taxes attributable to our foreign jurisdictions, establishing a valuation allowance against our federal research and development tax credit deferred tax asset, and an adjustment to deferred income tax expense due to the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate pursuant to the Tax Reform Act. The tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation associated with our US jurisdiction, offset by income taxes attributable to our foreign jurisdictions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $344.7 million in working capital, which included $67.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $133.0 million in marketable investments. As of December 31, 2018, we held approximately 34.5% of our cash and cash equivalents in foreign entities.\nIn March 2017, we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,495,000 shares of our common stock at public offering price of $76.00 per share, less the underwriters' discounts and commissions, pursuant to an underwritten public offering. We received approximately $106.3 million in net cash proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.8 million and other offering expenses of $0.5 million. We will continue to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, continued development of our products, including research and development and clinical trials, potential acquisitions and other business opportunities. Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering, we are investing the net proceeds in investment grade, interest bearing securities.\nIn addition to our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable investment balances, our principal source of liquidity is our accounts receivable. We believe these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our principal liquidity requirements are to fund our operations, which includes, but is not limited to, maintaining sufficient levels of inventory to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, funding research and development activities and funding our capital expenditures. We may also lease or purchase additional facilities to facilitate our growth. We expect to continue to make investments as we launch new products, expand our manufacturing operations and further expand into international markets. We may, however, require or elect to secure additional financing as we continue to execute our business strategy. If we require or elect to raise additional funds, we may do so through equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, could result in dilution to our stockholders and could require us to agree to covenants that limit our operating flexibility.\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, marketable investments and selected working capital data as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\n\n \n(1) Working capital consists of total current assets less total current liabilities.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents, net cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities and our ending balance of cash and cash equivalents:\n\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by and used in operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items (including depreciation and amortization, accretion of discounts or amortization of premium on marketable investments, stock-based compensation expense, loss on non-marketable equity investments, provision for doubtful accounts, inventory write-offs and write-downs, changes in deferred tax balances, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired IPR&D charges), and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.8 million in 2018 and consisted of net income of $2.9 million and non-cash items of $56.2 million offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $30.3 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities includes an increase in accounts receivable of $25.8 million, the increase in inventories of $22.3 million to support our revenue growth, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities of $14.2 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets of $2.2 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $1.3 million as a result of the growth in our business activities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $12.7 million in 2017 and consisted of net income of $4.7 million and non-cash items of $21.5 million offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $13.5 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities includes the increase in inventories of $18.8 million to support our revenue growth, an increase in accounts\nreceivable of $9.1 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities of $10.2 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets of $2.4 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $1.9 million as a result of the growth in our business activities.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $12.8 million in 2016 and consisted of net income of $14.8 million and non-cash items of $8.6 million offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $36.2 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities includes the increase in inventories of $19.7 million to support our revenue growth, an increase in accounts receivable of $14.6 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets of $9.0 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities of $5.8 million and accounts payable of $1.4 million, as a result of the growth in our business activities.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities\nNet cash used in and provided by investing activities relates primarily to purchases of marketable investments, the acquisition of assets or a business, capital expenditures and non-marketable investments, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable investments.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.4 million in 2018 and consisted of $20.4 million in payments, net of cash acquired, for the asset acquisition of MVI, capital expenditures of $9.6 million and contributions to non-marketable investments of $1.4 million. This was partially offset by proceeds from the maturities and sales of marketable investments, net of purchases, of $31.0 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $77.7 million in 2017 and consisted of purchases of marketable investments, net of sales and maturities, of $48.1 million, capital expenditures of $12.5 million, $9.3 million related to the acquisition of Crossmed net of cash acquired, purchase of non-marketable investments of $5.3 million, and purchases of intangible of $2.5 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $0.7 million in 2016 and consisted of net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable investments of $14.3 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $13.6 million.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash used in and provided by financing activities primarily relates to capital raising activities through equity and certain acquisition-related payments.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $9.8 million in 2018 and primarily consisted of payments of employee taxes related to vested common and restricted stock of $17.7 million and payments related to the 2017 acquisition of Crossmed of $4.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan of $7.2 million and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $5.1 million.\nFinancing activities in 2017 provided net cash of $104.4 million due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of issuance costs of $106.3 million, proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan of $5.8 million and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $5.0 million. This was partially offset by payment of employee taxes", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section of this report entitled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nPenumbra is a global healthcare company focused on innovative therapies. We design, develop, manufacture and market medical devices and have a broad portfolio of products that addresses challenging medical conditions and significant clinical needs across our major markets. Our team focuses on developing, manufacturing and marketing products for use by specialist physicians to drive improved clinical outcomes. We believe that the cost-effectiveness of our products is attractive to our hospital customers.\nSince our founding in 2004, we have invested heavily in our product development capabilities in our major markets: neuro and vascular. We have successfully developed, obtained regulatory clearance or approval for, and introduced products into the neurovascular market since 2007, vascular market since 2013 and neurosurgical market since 2014, respectively. We continue to expand our portfolio of product offerings, while developing and iterating on our currently available products.\nWe expect to continue to develop and build our portfolio of products, including our thrombectomy, embolization and access technologies. Generally, when we introduce a next generation product or a new product designed to replace a current product, sales of the earlier generation product or the product replaced decline. Our research and development activities are centered around the development of new products and clinical activities designed to support our regulatory submissions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our products. In addition to the development of thrombectomy, embolization and access technologies, in the second quarter of 2017, we formed MVI Health Inc. ( MVI\u201d), a privately-held joint venture, with Sixense Enterprises, Inc. ( Sixense\u201d) for the purpose of exploring healthcare applications of virtual reality technology. At the time MVI was formed, we held 50% of the issued and outstanding equity of MVI with Sixense holding the remaining 50%. On August 31, 2018, we acquired a 90% controlling interest in MVI and expect to continue to make investments to further develop MVI's technology which is currently in the development stage.\nWe sell our products to hospitals primarily through our direct sales organization in the United States, most of Europe, Canada and Australia, as well as through distributors in select international markets. In 2018, 34.7% of our revenue was generated from customers located outside of the United States. Our sales outside of the United States are denominated principally in the euro and Japanese yen, with some sales being denominated in other currencies. As a result, we have foreign exchange exposure, but do not currently engage in hedging.\nWe generated revenue of $444.9 million, $333.8 million and $263.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This represents annual increases of 33.3% and 26.8%, respectively.\nImpact of the MVI Asset Acquisition\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a $30.8 million in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d) charge in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in MVI which was accounted for as an asset acquisition. As a result of the IPR&D charge, we generated an operating loss of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This compared to an operating income of $1.2 million and operating loss $1.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our results are discussed in more detail in the Results of Operations section below.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nThere are a number of factors that have impacted, and we believe will continue to impact, our results of operations and growth. These factors include:\n \u2022 The rate at which we grow our salesforce and the speed at which newly hired salespeople become fully effective can impact our revenue growth or our costs incurred in anticipation of such growth. \n \u2022 Our industry is intensely competitive and, in particular, we compete with a number of large, well-capitalized companies. We must continue to successfully compete in light of our competitors' existing and future products and their resources to successfully market to the specialist physicians who use our products. \n \u2022 We must continue to successfully introduce new products that gain acceptance with specialist physicians and successfully transition from existing products to new products, ensuring adequate supply. In addition, as we introduce new products and expand our production capacity, we anticipate additional personnel will be hired and trained to build our inventory of components and finished goods in advance of sales, which may cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition. \n \u2022 Publications of clinical results by us, our competitors and other third parties can have a significant influence on whether, and the degree to which, our products are used by specialist physicians and the procedures and treatments those physicians choose to administer for a given condition. \n \u2022 The specialist physicians who use our products may not perform procedures during certain times of the year, such as those periods when they are at major medical conferences or are away from their practices for other reasons, the timing of which occurs irregularly during the year and from year to year. \n \u2022 Most of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in the local currency of the country in which we sell our products. As a result, our revenue from international sales can be significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience meaningful variability in our quarterly revenue, gross profit and gross margin percentage as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the number of available selling days, which can be impacted by holidays; the mix of products sold; the geographic mix of where products are sold; the demand for our products and the products of our competitors; the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for products; increased competition; the timing of customer orders; inventory write-offs due to obsolescence; costs, benefits and timing of new product introductions; costs, benefits and timing of the acquisition and integration of businesses and product lines we may acquire; the availability and cost of components and raw materials; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We may experience quarters in which we have significant revenue growth sequentially followed by quarters of moderate or no revenue growth. Additionally, we may experience quarters in which operating expenses, in particular research and development expenses, fluctuate depending on the stage and timing of product development.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable periods. Management bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could materially change our results from those reported. Management evaluates its estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. However, if our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant areas where management applies judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is comprised of product revenue net of returns, discounts, administration fees and sales rebates. We adopted the guidance under Topic 606 of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. Therefore, the comparative prior year information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605 with the impact of the adoption reflected in opening retained earnings. As a result of adoption, the cumulative impact to our retained earnings at January 1, 2018 was $0.3 million.\nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue from product sales is recognized either on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer, but is deferred for certain transactions when control has not yet transferred. With respect to products that we consign to hospitals, which primarily consist of coils, we recognize revenue at the time hospitals utilize products in a procedure. The implementation of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on the measurement or recognition of revenue from prior periods, however additional\ndisclosures have been added in accordance with the guidance. Refer to Note 14. Revenues\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information and disclosures on our revenue.\nWe defer revenue for amounts that we have already invoiced our customers for and are ultimately expected to be recognized as revenue, but for which not all revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nRevenue is recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration such as product returns utilizing historical return rates, rebates, discounts, and other adjustments to net revenue. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price. Variable consideration is included in revenue only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made no changes in estimates for variable consideration.\nOur terms and conditions permit product returns and exchanges. We base our estimates for sales returns on actual historical returns over the prior three years and they are recorded as reductions in revenue at the time of sale. Upon recognition, we reduce revenue and cost of revenue for the estimated return. Return rates can fluctuate over time, but are sufficiently predictable to allow us to estimate expected future product returns.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets ( DTAs\u201d) to their estimated realizable value.\nThe calculation of our DTAs involves the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments while taking into account estimates of the amounts and type of future taxable income. DTAs are reduced to their estimated realizable value by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the DTAs will not be achieved. Valuation allowances related to DTAs can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates, and projections of future taxable income.\nThe calculation of our current provision for income taxes involves the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments while taking into account current tax laws, interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future tax audits. We have established reserves to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Although we believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments to be reasonable, any changes in tax law or interpretation of tax law and the resolutions of potential tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe follow FASB ASC 740-10 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\u201d that prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our income tax returns, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalty accrual, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure requirements. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, ( the Tax Reform Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, including but not limited to, lowering our U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a one-time transition tax on previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, and creating new taxes on foreign sourced earnings. Also on December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) which provides guidance on accounting for tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. SAB 118 provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Reform Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Reform Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for tax effects of the Tax Reform Act under ASC 740 and therefore our financial statements reflect estimates of the tax affects based on current interpretations of the authoritative guidance available to date. In the reporting period ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an adjustment for the reduction of our U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a decrease to our DTAs in the amount of $15.4 million with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. No adjustments related to the federal tax rate reduction were made to our DTA balance subsequent to December 31, 2017. In the reporting period ended December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for the one-time transition tax on the cumulative value of foreign earnings and profits that were previously not repatriated for U.S. income tax purposes, and completed our analysis of the new global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d)\ninclusion attributable to foreign sourced earnings. The tax effects of the one-time transition tax and GILTI income inclusion did not have a material impact on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. We include U.S. taxes due on income inclusions attributable to GILTI as a period cost in the tax year incurred. Not all provisions of the Tax Reform Act are applicable to us in the tax year ended December 31, 2018. For example, we do not meet the statutory gross receipts threshold and therefore are not subject to the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse ( BEAT\u201d) minimum tax, and, due to current year losses we are not entitled to the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income ( FDII\u201d) deduction provisions.\nThe final impact of the Tax Reform Act may differ from our current estimates, due to, among other things, additional legislative guidance that may be issued which could change our current interpretation or application of the new tax law.\nSignificant domestic DTAs were generated in recent years, primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $100.0 million, $88.7 million and $0.7 million of federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we had research credits available to offset federal and state tax liabilities in the amount of $6.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively. The federal tax credits will begin to expire in 2024. California state tax credits have no expiration.\nWe assess the ability to realize the benefits of our DTAs in each reporting period by evaluating all available positive and negative evidence, objective and subjective in nature, including (1) cumulative results of operations in recent years, (2) sources of recent pre-tax income, (3) estimates of future taxable income, (4) the length of net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforward periods, and (5) the ability to carry back losses to prior years. We also measure our current DTA balances against estimates of future income based on objectively verifiable operating results from the Company's recent history.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our net DTA balance was $30.9 million, after reduction of a valuation allowance of $17.3 million. We do not maintain valuation allowances against any of our foreign DTAs as we believe, at the required more-likely-than-not level of certainty, that our foreign subsidiaries will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of their DTAs in full. In the period ended December 31, 2018, we measured our domestic net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) DTA balances against projections of future taxable income with consideration of relevant provisions of the Tax Reform Act, including but not limited to, the indefinite carryforward period for NOLs generated in years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. We also considered our three year cumulative income position, exclusive of the impact of excess tax deductions from stock-based compensation. We concluded that sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the benefit of our domestic NOLs in full.\nThe Tax Reform Act extended the carryforward period of net operating losses generated in tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 such that the losses may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limitation of 80% of taxable income. The tax attribute ordering rules provide that to offset taxable income, net operating losses must be used in full prior to the utilization of tax credits. Accordingly, our federal research and development tax credit DTAs, which have a 20 year carryforward period, is expected to expire prior to utilization based on future projected taxable income.\nAfter an evaluation of all available qualitative and quantitative evidence, both positive and negative in nature, we concluded that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the benefits of our domestic DTAs prior to expiration, other than our federal research and development tax credit DTAs which are expected to expire before their utilization. As a result, in the period ended December 31, 2018, we continued to record a valuation allowance against our federal research and development tax credit. In addition, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our California DTAs.\nOur DTA balance also includes $3.0 million of tax attributes gained upon acquisition of a majority interest ownership in MVI. Refer to Note 3. Investments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments\u201d for more information on the MVI Transfer Agreement. The acquired NOL DTAs are subject to Separate Return Limitation Year ( SRLY\u201d) rules which will limit the utilization of pre-acquisition tax attributes to offset future taxable income solely generated by MVI. As of December 31, 2018, we could not conclude, at the required more-likely-than-not level of certainty, that MVI will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of its tax attributes prior to expiration and so a $3.0 million valuation allowance was recorded against the DTAs acquired from MVI.\nWe will continue to closely monitor the need for a valuation allowance against current and additional DTAs generated in each subsequent reporting period. The need for a valuation allowance can be impacted by actual operating results, forecasted financial performance, and variances between the two, and the rate at which future DTAs are generated. If our management was to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net DTAs in the future, a valuation allowance related charge to earnings would be reflected in that period, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. If our management was to determine that we would be able to realize all net DTAs in the future, a\nreduction of the valuation allowance would be reflected as a benefit to earnings in that period, which could have a material positive impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business or assets over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may no longer be recoverable and that an impairment loss may have occurred. Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, change in customers, target market and strategy, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel, or change in reporting units. We operate as one segment, which is considered to be the sole reporting unit, and therefore goodwill is tested for impairment at the consolidated level.\nThe authoritative guidance allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If an entity determines that as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not (i.e. greater than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate and compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgments, including: identification of the reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, a qualitative assessment to determine whether there are any impairment indicators, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, cost factors, and entity specific factors such as strategies, overall financial performance (both current and projected) and market capitalization. In the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017, we performed qualitative assessments for goodwill impairment and determined there we no indicators of impairment. Refer to Note 7. Goodwill\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nValuation of Intangible Assets\nThe valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisitions are determined based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. In determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets, management provides its best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Certain estimates used in this process include the amount and timing of projected milestone-based payments on sales that are considered probable and estimable, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each acquired intangible asset, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. In conducting the annual impairment test for its indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (greater than 50% likelihood) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. In accordance with the authoritative guidance, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test to compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying amount. If we perform the quantitative test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally use a discounted cash flow method based on the present value of projected cash flows to estimate fair value. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts and discounted using a rate that is reflective of the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the projected cash flows of the business. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar analysis and valuations. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations may impact our projected cash flows, which could result in a potential impairment charge to the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed a quantitative impairment analysis on our indefinite-lived intangible asset and determined that the asset was not impaired. Refer to Note 6. Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nFinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets, which is the period during which expected cash flows support the fair value of such intangible assets. We review finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such an event occurs, management determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to the related asset group's carrying value. If an asset is considered impaired, the asset will be written down to the determined fair value based on discounted cash flows. We also periodically review the useful lives assigned to our\nintangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the underlying intangible asset. If a change were to occur in any of the above-mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase.\nValuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities\nCertain agreements the Company enters into, including business combinations, involve the potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon certain performance and revenue milestones being achieved. Contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date at fair value and is remeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs with the change in fair value recognized within sales, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of our contingent consideration is determined using a Monte-Carlo valuation model that simulates outcomes based on management estimates. Significant increases or decreases in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities can result from a number of factors, including changes in the timing and amount of projected revenue, our estimates of the likelihood of achieving certain milestones, as well as changes in discount periods and rates.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue. We sell our products directly to hospitals and through distributors for use in procedures performed by specialist physicians to treat patients in two key markets: neuro and vascular disease. We sell our products through purchase orders, and we do not have long term purchase commitments from our customers. Revenue from product sales is recognized either on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer, but is deferred for certain transactions when control has not yet transferred. With respect to products that we consign to hospitals, which primarily consist of coils, we recognize revenue at the time hospitals utilize products in a procedure. Revenue also includes shipping and handling costs that we charge to customers.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, inbound freight charges, receiving costs, inspection and testing costs, warehousing costs, royalty expense, shipping and handling costs and other labor and overhead costs incurred in the manufacturing of products. We manufacture substantially all of our products in our manufacturing facility at our campus in Alameda, California.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d). R&D expenses primarily consist of product development, clinical and regulatory expenses, materials, depreciation and other costs associated with the development of our products. R&D expenses also include salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel and consultants. We expense R&D costs as they are incurred.\nSales, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d). SG&A expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel and consultants engaged in sales, marketing, finance, legal, compliance, administrative, facilities and information technology and human resource activities. Our SG&A expenses also include marketing trials, medical education, training, commissions, generally based on a percentage of sales, to direct sales representatives, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs.\nIncome Tax Expense. We are taxed at the rates applicable within each jurisdiction in which we operate. The composite income tax rate, tax provisions, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities, and require us to exercise judgment in determining our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and the potential valuation allowance recorded against our net DTAs. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the DTAs will not be achieved.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth

million in 2017. Our revenue growth resulted from further market penetration of our existing products and sales of new products. Increased sales within our neuro and vascular businesses accounted for approximately 55% and 45% of the revenue increase, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenue from our neuro products increased $61.9 million, or 26.6%, to $294.3 million in 2018, from $232.4 million in 2017. This was primarily attributable to increased sales of our Penumbra System and neuro access products, which accounted for approximately 85% and slightly less than 20% of the neuro revenue increase, respectively. Our neuro product sales experienced strong momentum due to further market penetration and growth in the market for endovascular treatment of stroke, which led to an increase in the number of procedures performed by specialist physicians using these products. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in sales of our neuro embolization products, which decreased by slightly less than 5% of the total change in neuro revenue, as demand for our neuro embolization products fluctuates from period to period due to the number of procedures performed. Prices for our neuro products remained substantially unchanged during the period.\nRevenue from our vascular products increased $49.3 million, or 48.6%, to $150.6 million in 2018, from $101.3 million in 2017. This was primarily attributable to increased sales of our Indigo System products, which accounted for slightly more than 45% of the vascular revenue increase for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was driven by further market penetration which led to increases in the number of procedures performed by specialist physicians using our products.

The tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation associated with our US jurisdiction, offset by income taxes attributable to our foreign jurisdictions and a tax charge resulting from the IPR&D expense associated with the acquisition of a controlling interest in MVI, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The tax benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation associated with our US jurisdiction, offset by income taxes attributable to our foreign jurisdictions, establishing a valuation allowance against our federal research and development tax credit deferred tax asset, and an adjustment to deferred income tax expense due to the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate pursuant to the Tax Reform Act.\nOur effective tax rate is driven by (1) permanent differences in taxable income for tax and financial reporting purposes, (2) tax expense attributable to our foreign jurisdictions, (3) changes to the valuation allowance maintained against our deferred tax assets, and (4) discrete tax adjustments such as excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our income tax provision is subject to volatility as the amount of excess tax benefits can fluctuate from period to period based on the price of our stock, the volume of share-based grants settled or vested, and the fair value assigned to equity awards under U.S. GAAP.

As of December 31, 2018, we held approximately 34.5% of our cash and cash equivalents in foreign entities.\nIn March 2017, we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,495,000 shares of our common stock at public offering price of $76.00 per share, less the underwriters' discounts and commissions, pursuant to an underwritten public offering. We received approximately $106.3 million in net cash proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.8 million and other offering expenses of $0.5 million. We will continue to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, continued development of our products, including research and development and clinical trials, potential acquisitions and other business opportunities. Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering, we are investing the net proceeds in investment grade, interest bearing securities.\nIn addition to our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable investment balances, our principal source of liquidity is our accounts receivable. We believe these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our principal liquidity requirements are to fund our operations, which includes, but is not limited to, maintaining sufficient levels of inventory to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, funding research and development activities and funding our capital expenditures. We may also lease or purchase additional facilities to facilitate our growth. We expect to continue to make investments as we launch new products, expand our manufacturing operations and further expand into international markets. We may, however, require or elect to secure additional financing as we continue to execute our business strategy. If we require or elect to raise additional funds, we may do so through equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, could result in dilution to our stockholders and could require us to agree to covenants that limit our operating flexibility.\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, marketable investments and selected working capital data as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketable investments\n</td> <td>133,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td>81,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>8,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued liabilities\n</td> <td>57,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital(1)\n</td> <td>344,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>330,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n(1) Working capital consists of total current assets less total current liabilities.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents, net cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities and our ending balance of cash and cash equivalents:\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>28,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,807\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>(385\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77,653\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(9,815\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td>67,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by and used in operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items (including depreciation and amortization, accretion of discounts or amortization of premium on marketable investments, stock-based compensation expense, loss on non-marketable equity investments, provision for doubtful accounts, inventory write-offs and write-downs, changes in deferred tax balances, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired IPR&D charges), and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.8 million in 2018 and consisted of net income of $2.9 million and non-cash items of $56.2 million offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $30.3 million.
