MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the \"Selected Financial Data\" above and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Also see \"Forward Looking Statements\" preceding Part I.\nOverview\nMVP REIT, Inc. (the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") was incorporated on April 3, 2012 as a Maryland corporation, and has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Pursuant to its initial public offering, which closed in September 2015, the Company received net consideration of approximately $97.3 million for the issuance of its common stock. Of this amount, approximately $19.5 million of common shares were issued in consideration of the contribution of commercial properties to the Company. The Company has also registered up to $50 million for the issuance of common stock pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the \"DRIP\") under which common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock.\nThe Company's investment strategy was to invest available net proceeds from its offering in direct investments in real property and real estate secured loans that meet the Company's investment objectives and strategies. In March 2014, the Company's board of directors approved a plan to increase the focus of the Company's investment strategy on parking and self- storage facilities located throughout the United States as the Company's core assets. In June 2014, the Company's board decided to further focus the Company's investments primarily on parking facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, MVP REIT acquired an ownership interest in the following properties:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> Property Name\n</td> <td> MVP REIT\n%\n</td> <td> MVP REIT II %\n</td> <td> Total Purchase Price\n</td> <td> Purchase Date\n</td> <td> Property Type\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated Properties listed as investments in real estate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Indianapolis Meridian\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td> $1,550,000\n</td> <td> 1/15/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Milwaukee Clybourn\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td> $205,000\n</td> <td> 1/20/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Milwaukee Arena\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td> $3,900,000\n</td> <td> 2/1/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Clarksburg\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td> $620,000\n</td> <td> 2/9/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Bridgeport Fairfield Garage\n</td> <td> 90.0%\n</td> <td> 10.0%\n</td> <td> $7,800,000\n</td> <td> 3/30/2016\n</td> <td> Garage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minneapolis City Parking\n</td> <td> 87.0%\n</td> <td> 13.0%\n</td> <td> $9,395,000\n</td> <td> 1/6/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Houston Preston Lot\n</td> <td> 80.0%\n</td> <td> 20.0%\n</td> <td> $2,800,000\n</td> <td> 11/22/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Denver Sherman 1935\n</td> <td> 76.0%\n</td> <td> 24.0%\n</td> <td> $2,437,500\n</td> <td> 2/12/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment in equity method investee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Cleveland West 9th (1)\n</td> <td> 49.0%\n</td> <td> 51.0%\n</td> <td> $5,675,000\n</td> <td> 5/11/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 33740 Crown Colony (1)\n</td> <td> 49.0%\n</td> <td> 51.0%\n</td> <td> $3,030,000\n</td> <td> 5/17/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> White Front Garage Partners\n</td> <td> 20.0%\n</td> <td> 80.0%\n</td> <td> $11,496,000\n</td> <td> 9/30/2016\n</td> <td> Garage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assets held for sale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Minneapolis Venture\n</td> <td> 87.0%\n</td> <td> 13.0%\n</td> <td> $6,100,000\n</td> <td> 1/6/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty information continued:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> Property Name\n</td> <td> #

The Company owns a 20% equity interest in the MVP Detroit Center and MVP REIT II owns an 80% equity interest. The parking garage will be operated by SP Plus Corporation (\"SP+\") under a long-term lease, where SP+ will be responsible for the first $572,000 in property taxes, pay annual base rent of $3.4 million, and 80% of all gross revenue above $5.0 million. As part of the acquisition MVP Detroit Center entered into a $31.5 million loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A., with a term of 10 years, amortized over 25 years, with monthly principal and interest payments totaling approximately $194,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 5.52%, secured by the parking garage, and maturing in February 2027.\nSince a majority of our property leases call for additional percentage rent, MVP monitors the gross revenue generated by each property on a monthly basis. The higher the property's gross revenue the higher our potential percentage rent. Below is graph showing the comparison of our monthly rental income to the gross revenue generated by the properties.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company held a 51% or more interest in 27 properties (out of 30 total investments), with initial purchase prices totaling approximately $122 million, of which our portion was $115.8 million. Of those 27 properties; 21 were owned 100% by us, three properties had common ownership with MVP REIT II and one had common ownership with an unrelated third party. One of the properties owned by us and MVP REIT II is currently listed for sale at $6.1 million. In addition, MVP held a less than 50% ownership in three properties, where MVP REIT II owned the majority share, of which our share of the purchase price was approximately $6.6 million. These properties were acquired with funds from the initial public offering, third party financing and the assumption of existing liabilities\nThe Company may, from time to time, invest in non-core assets, including investments in companies that manage real estate or mortgage investment companies; however, the Company anticipates that its core investments going forward will be predominantly in parking facilities. In addition, the Company has agreed that no more than 25% of the gross proceeds from its initial public offering will be used to invest in real properties other than parking facilities.\nAs previously reported, on March 7, 2016, the Company's board of directors approved taking the necessary action to list its common shares on the NASDAQ Global Market with view to providing a liquidity opportunity for its stockholders. In connection with the action to list the shares, on May 5, 2016, the Company's board of directors suspended the Company's distribution reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\"). In June 2016, the Company and MVP REIT II, jointly announced the engagement of Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. to assist in evaluating various courses of action intended to enhance stockholder liquidity and value. In connection with the engagement, the Company decided to defer taking further action to list the Company's common shares on the NASDAQ Global Market until Ladenburg Thalmann completes its evaluation. After reviewing the Ladenburg Thalmann's completed evaluation, the Company's board of directors will decide whether to proceed with a listing on the NASDAQ Global Market or take other action to enhance stockholder liquidity and value. The Company currently expects that no decision on this matter will be made until the second fiscal quarter of 2017. Following the Company's engagement of Ladenburg Thalmann, the Company's board of directors approved the reinstatement DRIP in July 2016, since no decision on liquidity is expected until the second fiscal quarter of 2017. There can be no assurance as to if or when the Company will again pursue a listing or another liquidity transaction.\nThe Company operates as a REIT. The Company is not a mutual fund or an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, nor is the Company subject to any regulation thereunder. As a REIT, the Company is required to have a December 31 fiscal year end. As a REIT, the Company will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to stockholders. Among other requirements, REITs are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests, which may affect the composition of assets the Company acquires with the proceeds of the offering. In addition, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nThe Company's board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over the Company, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, however, our board has delegated to MVP Realty Advisors, LLC, our advisor, authority to manage our day-to-day business, in accordance with our investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., (\"VRM II\") owns 60% of the Advisor, and the remaining 40% is owned by Vestin Realty Mortgage I, Inc. (\"VRM I\"); both are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC. The Company's sponsor is MVP Capital Partners, LLC (\"MVPCP\" or the \"Sponsor\"), an entity owned and managed by Michael V. Shustek, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Michael Shustek owns a significant majority of Vestin Mortgage, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, which is the manager of VRM I, and VRM II.\nVRM I, an OTC Pink Sheet-listed company, and VRM II, a Nasdaq-listed company that has provided notice of its intent to delist from Nasdaq on or about March 30, 2017, are engaged primarily in the business of investing in commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. As the owners of the Advisor, VRM I and VRM II may benefit from any fees and other compensation that the Company pays to the Advisor under the Advisor Agreement. In this regard, the Company notes that the Advisor has agreed to waive certain fees and expenses it otherwise would be entitled under the Advisory Agreement. Please refer to Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company in Part II, Item 8 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate amount of fees and expense reimbursements waived by the Advisor was approximately $6.9 million. If the owners of the Advisor determine that such waivers are no longer in the best interests of their stockholders or otherwise refuse to grant future waivers of fees or expenses if requested by the Company, then the Company's operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the amount of distributions to stockholders.\nIn addition, the Company may compete against MVP REIT II, VRM I and VRM II, all of whom are managed by affiliates of our sponsor, for the acquisition of investments. The Company believes this potential conflict with respect to VRM I and VRM II, is mitigated, in part, by the Company's focus on parking facilities as its core investments, while the investment strategy of VRM I and VRM II focuses on acquiring office buildings and other commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. MVP REIT II has substantially the same investment strategy as the Company, in that MVP REIT II is also focused primarily on investments in parking facilities. For additional discussion regarding potential conflicts of interests, please see \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest\" and \"Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nMVP has purchased the majority of the properties since January 1, 2015, and the results of operations below reflect start-up costs as well as acquisition expenses incurred in connection with purchasing properties as the Company deployed our offering proceeds. We expect that income and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future years as a result of owning the properties acquired for a full year and as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets. The results of operations described below may not be indicative of future results of operations.\nComparison of operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> Rental revenues (by property)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ft.

The increase in total rental revenues is mainly due to the additional properties acquired by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. As the common stock offering has been closed since 2015 and the majority of the Company's capital has been deployed, we do not expect to see the similar growth in revenue that MVP experienced from 2014 to 2016, to continue in the foreseeable future. The Company does expect to see continued grow from percentage rent on many of our properties over the next few years, as the properties purchased during 2016 will see the end of their 1st lease contract year in 2017. This is when they will be eligible to received percentage rent.\nAssets purchased in 2012 and 2013 were sold as of December 31, 2015, and income from those investments is reported as income (loss) from assets held for sale in the discontinued operations, net of income taxes section of our consolidated statements of operations.\nSee Note I - Acquisitions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,791,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 910,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 775,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of investment in real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,081,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 678,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 235,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition expenses - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,458,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,649,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,898,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operation and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,980,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 421,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 43,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operation and maintenance - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,055,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 566,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 379,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan payoff fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 587,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,263,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 799,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,315,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,023,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,374,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncrease in operating expenses is mainly due to the additional properties owned by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2016 the Company recorded a loss on impairment of $100,000 on Indy Meridian in accordance with an appraisal received during the 3rd quarter. In addition, the Company refinanced a loan on our Fort Worth property that was assumed when we purchased the property. The loan we assumed had an annual interest rate of 5.59% and matured in August 2021 with a balloon payment of approximated $10.2 million due at maturity. The new loan with American National Insurance Company (\"ANICO\") has an annual interest rate of 4.50%, will mature in November of 2026 and will have a balloon payment of approximately $9.5 million. As part of the refinancing of this loan the company was able to obtain an additional $0.5 million in loan proceeds for general repairs and maintenance to the Fort Worth property. The early extinguishment of the existing debt called for a prepayment penalty of approximately $587,000. Management believes that the extra money for repairs and maintenance, along with the lower interest rate for an additional five years, out weight the cost of the prepayment penalty and puts the property in a better position for the long term.\nSee Note I - Acquisitions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> Other income and (expense)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,381,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,313,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (169,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from investment in equity method investee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 116,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on acquisition of investment real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 127,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,266,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,313,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (36,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense has increase from 2014 to 2016 due to the assumption of debt through acquisitions and adding new debt to acquisitions that were completed with cash previously. To maximize the use of our cash, the Company will continue to looks for opportunities to put financing in place on existing properties and future acquisitions. The interest expense will vary based on the amount of our borrowings and current interest rates at the time of financing. The Company will seek to secure appropriate leverage with the lowest interest rate available to us. The terms of the loans will greatly depend on the quality of the property, the credit worthiness of the tenant and the amount of income the property is able to generate through parking revenue. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all. Interest expense recorded for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, includes loan amortization costs. Total loan amortization cost over this period totaled approximately $195,000, $85,000 and $22,000, respectively.\nSee Note K - Notes Payable and Note M - Line of Credit of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> Discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from assets held for sale, net of income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (244,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 214,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 876,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of investment in real estate held for sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,260,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total income (loss) from discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (244,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,474,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 920,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had an 87.09% ownership interest in one property that was listed as held for sale, with a carrying value of approximately $6.1 million. This property was acquired on January 6, 2016, along with MVP REIT II, with the purchase of two parking lots located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This property is accounted for at the fair value based on an appraisal.\nDuring June 2016, Minneapolis Venture entered into a purchase and sales agreement (the \"PSA\") to sell the 10th Street lot \"as is\" to a third party for approximately $6.1 million, which was cancelled in October 2016. During February 2017, the Company entered into a letter of intent to sell a portion of the property (approximately 2.2 acres) to an unrelated third party for $3.0 million. The remaining portion of the property will be retained by the Company and will be leased to a parking operator.\nSee Note L - Assets Held for Sale of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the first and second quarters of 2014, the Company's Board approved a sale of its interest in six office buildings to VRM I and VRM II in exchange for VRM I and VRM II's interest in five parking facilities and a storage facility. Additionally, during June 2014, the Company's Board approved a sale of its interest in two additional office buildings to VRM I and VRM II. The net income from the office buildings is reported as discontinued operations. Subsequently, during January 2015, management entered into a plan to sell the storage unit assets resulting in the financial reporting of these assets, liabilities and results of operations related to the assets held for sale, as discontinued operations. The sale of the storage assets resulted in a gain on sale of investment in real estate held for sale of approximately $1.3 million.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe Advisor believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Additionally, publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, the Company believes that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nIn order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") promulgated a measure known as funds from operations (\"FFO\"). FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property, adding back asset impairment write-downs, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, the Company believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT\ndefinition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company does, making comparisons less meaningful.\nThe Investment Program Association (\"IPA\") issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 (the \"IPA MFFO Guideline\") on November 2, 2010, which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations (\"MFFO\"). In computing MFFO, FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent, amortization of in-place lease valuations, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss), and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Management is responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk. To achieve our objectives, the Company may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. In order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments, if any, the Company may enter into interest rate cap agreements and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency exposure, if any, the Company may enter into foreign currency hedges. The Company views fair value adjustments of derivatives, impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations, assessments regarding general market conditions, and the specific performance of properties owned, which can change over time. No less frequently than annually, the Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to any liquidity event.\nThe Company adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a helpful indicator of our on-going portfolio performance and ability to sustain our current distribution level. More specifically, MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT's operations. MFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or our future ability to pay our dividends. By providing FFO and MFFO, the Company presents information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management's analysis of long-term operating activities. MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of our portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions, as well as a comparison of our performance with that of other non-traded REITs, as MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and the Company believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. As explained below, management's evaluation of our operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Straight-line rent. Most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, these periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting. As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Amortization of in-place lease valuation. As this item is a cash flow adjustment made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Acquisition-related costs. The Company was organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property and loans secured by real estate in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders. In the process, the Company incurs non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs, which in accordance with GAAP, are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from the offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate. If the Company acquires a property after all offering proceeds from the offering have been invested, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to our Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. In evaluating the performance of our portfolio over time, management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments' revenues and expenses. Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect our operating results, cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired, as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets. By excluding acquisition-related costs, MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made. However, it can provide an indication of our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after the Company ceases to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis, which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours. Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor all of these reasons, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO, in addition to income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO. Additionally, MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value. The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if the Company does not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed. However, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO. Therefore, FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other organization body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and the Company may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure.\nOur calculation of FFO and MFFO, attributable to common shareholders is presented in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss attributable to MVP REIT, Inc. common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,266,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,360,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,837,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtract:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in deferred rental assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (132,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (332,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on Sale of REO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,260,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (44,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,263,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 799,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discontinued operations loss (income)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 244,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (214,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (876,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan payoff fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 587,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment write-downs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,006,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,167,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,045,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses to non-affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,081,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 678,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 235,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses to affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,458,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,649,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,898,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MFFO attributable to MVP REIT, Inc common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,533,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,160,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (912,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital and Liquidity Resources\nThe Company commenced operations on December 11, 2012 and acquired our first property on December 14, 2012.\nOur principal demand for funds will be/and is for the acquisition of real estate assets, funding of loans secured by real estate, the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest on our outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions to our stockholders. Over time, the Company intends to generally fund its operating expenses from its cash flow from operations. The cash required for acquisitions and investments in real estate will be funded primarily from the sale of shares through our distribution reinvestment plan, dispositions of properties in our portfolio and through third party financing and the assumption of debt on acquired properties.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3.3 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses such as management fees, accounting fees and legal bills. Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $27.2 million and consisted mainly of cash used in investment of real estate of approximately $28.7 million of which approximately $16.0 million was applied to purchase from deposits in prior periods, investment in equity method investee of approximately $6.6 million, $6.1 million used in investment in real estate held for sale and approximately $1.5 million is on deposit for future acquisitions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $24.2 million and consisted of proceeds from notes payable of approximately $34.7 million, proceeds from line of credit of approximately $4.8 million, payments on redeemed shares of approximately $1.6 million, payments on notes payable of approximately $12.9 million, capital contributions from non-controlling interest-related party of approximately $4 million, purchase of non- controlling interest of approximately $0.8 million and distributions to stockholders and non-controlling interest of approximately $5.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.4 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses such as management fees, accounting fees, legal bills and expenses related to real estate owned held for sale. Operating cash flows were provided by the receipt of proceeds from our assets held for sale. Net cash used in investing activities consisted mainly of cash used in investment of real estate of approximately $48.6 million, deposits on future acquisitions of approximately $15.7 million and provided by proceeds from the sale of Red Mountain and Cedar Park of approximately $9.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of commissions of approximately $58.5 million and proceeds from a promissory note of approximately $3.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities consisted of payments on redeemed shares of approximately $0.4 million, payments on notes payable of approximately $0.7 million, payments on notes payable - held for sale of approximately $4.3 million and distributions to stockholders of approximately $2.9 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.8. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.6. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $17.7.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company has eight promissory notes in the aggregate amount of approximately $49.4 million, net of loan issuance costs, secured by our real estate. Our charter precludes us from borrowing more than the NASAA REIT Guidelines limit of 300% of our net assets, unless a majority of our independent directors approve any borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets and the justification for such excess borrowing is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report. The Company expects that it may use leverage for any senior debt or equity investments that the Company makes. The Company expects that our debt financing, if any, on such investments will not exceed 50% of the greater of the cost or fair market value of our overall investments.\nOn October 5, 2016, the Company, through its Operating LLC, and MVP REIT II, through a wholly owned subsidiary (the \"Borrowers\") entered into a credit agreement (the \"Unsecured Credit Agreement\") with KeyBank, National Association ('KeyBank\") as the administrative agent and KeyBanc Capital Markets (\"KeyBanc Capital Markets\") as the lead arranger. Pursuant to the Unsecured Credit Agreement, the Borrowers were provided with a $30 million unsecured credit facility (the \"Unsecured Credit Facility\"), which may be increased up to $100 million, in minimum increments of $10 million. The Unsecured Credit Facility has an initial term of two years, maturing on October 5, 2018, and may be extended for a one-year period if certain conditions are met and upon payment of an extension fee. The Unsecured Credit Facility has an annual interest rate calculated based on LIBOR Rate plus 2.25% or Base Rate plus 1.25%, both as provided in the Unsecured Credit Agreement. The Base Rate is calculated as the greater of (i) the KeyBank Prime rate or (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus \u00bd of 1%. Payments under the Unsecured Credit Facility are interest only and are due on the first day of each quarter. The obligations of the Borrowers of the Unsecured Credit Agreement are joint and several. The Borrowers have entered into cross-indemnification provisions with respect to their joint and several obligations under the Unsecured Credit Agreement.\nThe Company will experience a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate our assets and may experience a temporary, relative increase in liquidity if and when investments are sold, to the extent such sales generate proceeds that are available for additional investments. Our advisor may, but is not required to, establish working capital reserves from offering proceeds out of cash flow generated by our investments or out of proceeds from the sale of our investments. The Company also may, but is not required to, establish reserves out of cash flow generated by investments or out of net sale proceeds in non-liquidating sale transactions. Working capital reserves are typically utilized to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions and major capital expenditures. Our lenders also may require working capital reserves.\nTo the extent that the working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, additional funds may be provided from cash generated from operations or through short- term borrowing. In addition, subject to the limitations previously described in our prospectus, the Company may incur indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of any real estate asset, refinance the debt thereon, arrange for the leveraging of any previously unfinanced property or reinvest the proceeds of financing or refinancing in additional properties.\nIn addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, the Company expects to use its capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and the selling agent(s). During the organization and offering stage, these payments included payments to the selling agent(s) for selling commissions and payments to our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and offering expenses. During the acquisition and development stage, the Company expects to make payments to our advisor in connection with the selection or purchase of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us. For a discussion of the compensation to be paid to our advisor, see \" Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company\", included in Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our advisor and our board of directors.\nManagement Compensation Summary\nThe following table summarizes all compensation and fees incurred by us and paid or payable to our Advisor and its affiliates in connection with our organization, our initial public offering and our operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling Commissions - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition Fees - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,458,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,649,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,898,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset Management Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 941,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 500,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 350,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt Financing Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 114,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,513,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,215,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,279,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistributions\nThe Company intends to continue making regular cash distributions to its stockholders, typically on a monthly basis. The actual amount and timing of distributions will be determined by our board of directors in its discretion and typically will depend on the amount of funds available for distribution, which is impacted by current and projected cash requirements, tax considerations and other factors. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company must make distributions equal to at least 90% of its \"REIT taxable income\" each year.\nOn October 3, 2012, the Company confirmed that its board of directors had approved a plan for payment of initial monthly cash distributions of $0.045 per share. On January 25, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that its board of directors had approved an increase in its monthly distribution rate on its common shares to an annualized distribution rate of 6.2 percent, or $0.558 per share annually and $0.0465 per share monthly, assuming a purchase price of $9.00 per share. The distribution rate, which had previously been 6 percent, increased beginning with the January 2013 distribution. On June 4, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that its board of directors has approved an increase in its monthly distribution rate on its common shares to an annualized distribution rate of 6.7%, or $0.60 per share annually and $0.05025 monthly assuming a purchase price of $9.00 per share. The Company anticipates paying future distributions monthly in arrears, with a record date on the 24th of each month and distributions paid on the 10th day of the following month (or the next business day if the 10th is not a business day). Starting April 11, 2016, the NAV of $9.14 per common share has been used for purposes of effectuating permitted redemptions of the Company's common stock and issuing shares pursuant to the Company's distribution reinvestment plan.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2016, the Company has paid approximately $13.6 million in distributions including approximately $2.9 million in DRIP distributions to the Company's stockholders, all of which have constituted a return of capital. Our total distributions paid for the period presented, the sources of such distributions, the cash flows used in operations and the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, are detailed below.\nTo date, the all of distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and represent a return of capital.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

from operations to fully fund distributions. We may continue to pay all or a portion of the distributions from other sources, such as cash flows from offering proceeds, financing activities, borrowings, cash advances from our Advisor, or by way of waiver or deferral of fees. The Company has not established any limit on the extent to which distributions could be funded from these other sources. Accordingly, the amount of distributions paid may not reflect current cash flow from operations and distributions may include a return of capital, rather than a return on capital. If the Company continues to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the funds available to the Company for investments would be reduced and the share value may be diluted. The level of distributions will be determined by the board of directors and depend on a number of factors including current and projected liquidity requirements, anticipated operating cash flows and tax considerations, and other relevant items deemed applicable by the board of directors.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Arrangements\nOn November 5, 2016, MVP REIT II, Inc. purchased 338,409 shares of MVP REIT, Inc's common stock from an unrelated third party for $3.0 million or $8.865 per share. During the year ended, the Company paid MVP REIT II, approximately $34,000 in distributions, related to their ownership of the Company's common stock.\nFor more information, see Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees\nInflation\nThe Company expects to include provisions in its tenant leases designed to protect the Company from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is organized and conducts operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") and to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with respect thereto. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its REIT taxable income (\"Taxable Income\"), which is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of Taxable Income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. Our Taxable Income may substantially exceed or be less than our net income as determined based on GAAP, because, differences in GAAP and taxable net income consist primarily of allowances for loan losses or doubtful account, write-downs on real estate held for sale, amortization of deferred financing cost, capital gains and losses, and deferred income.\nA tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation process, based on the technical merits. Based on our evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition on the financial statements. The net income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately zero.\nThe Company has entered into agreements with affiliates of its Sponsor, whereby the Company will pay certain fees or reimbursements to the Advisor or its affiliates in connection with, among other things, acquisition and financing activities, asset and property management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs. See Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nREIT Compliance\nThe Company filed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective for the year ended December 31, 2013: therefore, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to the stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, including and after the taxable year in which the Company initially elects to be taxed as a REIT, the Company will be subject to federal income taxes on the taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is denied. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect the Company's net income.\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company will be required to distribute at least 90% of the REIT taxable income to the stockholders. The Company must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. The Company will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact the REIT status. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to federal income taxes (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Company believes it has met all the required criteria to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes as of December 31, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016.\nReal Estate Investments & Industry Outlook\nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nWe are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate, we would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nWe are required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold, as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented. Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as \"held for sale\" on the balance sheet.\nWe believe that favorable U.S. Treasury yields and competitive lender spreads have created a generally favorable borrowing environment for real estate purchases in 2015 and 2016. Given the uncertainty around the world's financial markets, we believe investors have been willing to accept lower yields on U.S. government backed securities, providing Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae with access to investor capital. During the fourth quarter of 2016, U.S. Treasury rates increased, and we expect that US Treasury rates will continue to increase over the next year, which we anticipate will make it harder to finance our current unencumbered properties or to finance new acquisitions at favorable rates. Management will continue to look for favorable financing opportunities that will maximize our use of cash, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to find favorable rates.\nParking Industry Outlook\nIn December 2016, the National Parking Association, (\"NPA\"), release their annual Parking Demand Report, which highlighted long-term demand and potential trends in the parking industry. According to the NPA's website http://weareparking.org some of the key finds include:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Parking revenue is projected to grow from just under $25 billion in 2015 to nearly $29 billion by 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The #1 reason for parking growth is population expansion projected to increase from 320M in 2015, to 400M by 2050.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> 15 year trend continues, 86 percent of U.S. commuters' say driving and parking their vehicle is their dominant mode of transportation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Approximately 119.9M Americans drive to work (2013 U.S. Census).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Phoenix highlight urbanization and density and have the most parking growth potential.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The top two states in terms of parking revenue are California ($1.4 billion), and New York ($1.2 billion).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> By region, population density leads to parking growth in the New York/Northeast corridor.

When looking at macroeconomic, demographic, employment, and industry statistics, NPA sees a picture of patterns that influence parking demand in North America:\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Population: Fundamental population growth of 9.6% from the 2000 U.S. Census to the 2010 U.S. Census is expected to continue into the future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Employment: In the U.S., 92% employment provides sustained parking demand, 6.2% unemployment as of August 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Baby Boomers.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions is different, it is possible that different accounting policies will be applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses will be recorded, resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements or different amounts reported in the financial statements.\nAdditionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management considers to be most critical once we commence significant operations. These policies require complex judgment in their application or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant. Factors considered by us in our analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we will include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period. Estimates of costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses are also utilized.\nAbove-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease. The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases. In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, we initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option. The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.\nThe value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases. The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we will utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. We will also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2016, our contractual obligations consisted of the mortgage notes secured by our acquired properties and the Revolving Credit Facility:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,523,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,286,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,143,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,424,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,670,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital and Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of Credit:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principle\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,810,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,810,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,333,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,096,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,143,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,424,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,670,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual obligation table amount does not reflect the unamortized loan issuance cost of $1.1 million for notes payable and $164,000 for the line of credit as of December 31, 2016.\nSubsequent Events\nDuring January 2017, the Company and MVP REIT II, through MVP Detroit Center Garage, LLC (\"MVP Detroit Center\"), an entity owned by the Company and MVP REIT II, acquired a multi-level parking garage consisting of approximately 1,275 parking spaces, located in Detroit, Michigan, for a purchase price of $55.0 million, plus acquisition and financing-related transaction costs.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the \"Selected Financial Data\" above and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Also see \"Forward Looking Statements\" preceding Part I.\nOverview\nMVP REIT, Inc. (the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") was incorporated on April 3, 2012 as a Maryland corporation, and has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Pursuant to its initial public offering, which closed in September 2015, the Company received net consideration of approximately $97.3 million for the issuance of its common stock. Of this amount, approximately $19.5 million of common shares were issued in consideration of the contribution of commercial properties to the Company. The Company has also registered up to $50 million for the issuance of common stock pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the \"DRIP\") under which common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock.\nThe Company's investment strategy was to invest available net proceeds from its offering in direct investments in real property and real estate secured loans that meet the Company's investment objectives and strategies. In March 2014, the Company's board of directors approved a plan to increase the focus of the Company's investment strategy on parking and self- storage facilities located throughout the United States as the Company's core assets. In June 2014, the Company's board decided to further focus the Company's investments primarily on parking facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, MVP REIT acquired an ownership interest in the following properties:\n\nProperty information continued:\n\n (1) In November 2016, these properties were merged into one holding company called MVP Cleveland West 9th II, LLC, for the purposes of debt financing. \nDuring January 2017, the Company and MVP REIT II, through MVP Detroit Center Garage, LLC (\"MVP Detroit Center\"), an entity owned by the Company and MVP REIT II, acquired a multi-level parking garage consisting of approximately 1,275 parking spaces, located in Detroit, Michigan, for a purchase price of $55.0 million, plus acquisition and financing-related transaction costs. The Company owns a 20% equity interest in the MVP Detroit Center and MVP REIT II owns an 80% equity interest. The parking garage will be operated by SP Plus Corporation (\"SP+\") under a long-term lease, where SP+ will be responsible for the first $572,000 in property taxes, pay annual base rent of $3.4 million, and 80% of all gross revenue above $5.0 million. As part of the acquisition MVP Detroit Center entered into a $31.5 million loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A., with a term of 10 years, amortized over 25 years, with monthly principal and interest payments totaling approximately $194,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 5.52%, secured by the parking garage, and maturing in February 2027.\nSince a majority of our property leases call for additional percentage rent, MVP monitors the gross revenue generated by each property on a monthly basis. The higher the property's gross revenue the higher our potential percentage rent. Below is graph showing the comparison of our monthly rental income to the gross revenue generated by the properties.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company held a 51% or more interest in 27 properties (out of 30 total investments), with initial purchase prices totaling approximately $122 million, of which our portion was $115.8 million. Of those 27 properties; 21 were owned 100% by us, three properties had common ownership with MVP REIT II and one had common ownership with an unrelated third party. One of the properties owned by us and MVP REIT II is currently listed for sale at $6.1 million. In addition, MVP held a less than 50% ownership in three properties, where MVP REIT II owned the majority share, of which our share of the purchase price was approximately $6.6 million. These properties were acquired with funds from the initial public offering, third party financing and the assumption of existing liabilities\nThe Company may, from time to time, invest in non-core assets, including investments in companies that manage real estate or mortgage investment companies; however, the Company anticipates that its core investments going forward will be predominantly in parking facilities. In addition, the Company has agreed that no more than 25% of the gross proceeds from its initial public offering will be used to invest in real properties other than parking facilities.\nAs previously reported, on March 7, 2016, the Company's board of directors approved taking the necessary action to list its common shares on the NASDAQ Global Market with view to providing a liquidity opportunity for its stockholders. In connection with the action to list the shares, on May 5, 2016, the Company's board of directors suspended the Company's distribution reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\"). In June 2016, the Company and MVP REIT II, jointly announced the engagement of Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. to assist in evaluating various courses of action intended to enhance stockholder liquidity and value. In connection with the engagement, the Company decided to defer taking further action to list the Company's common shares on the NASDAQ Global Market until Ladenburg Thalmann completes its evaluation. After reviewing the Ladenburg Thalmann's completed evaluation, the Company's board of directors will decide whether to proceed with a listing on the NASDAQ Global Market or take other action to enhance stockholder liquidity and value. The Company currently expects that no decision on this matter will be made until the second fiscal quarter of 2017. Following the Company's engagement of Ladenburg Thalmann, the Company's board of directors approved the reinstatement DRIP in July 2016, since no decision on liquidity is expected until the second fiscal quarter of 2017. There can be no assurance as to if or when the Company will again pursue a listing or another liquidity transaction.\nThe Company operates as a REIT. The Company is not a mutual fund or an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, nor is the Company subject to any regulation thereunder. As a REIT, the Company is required to have a December 31 fiscal year end. As a REIT, the Company will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to stockholders. Among other requirements, REITs are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests, which may affect the composition of assets the Company acquires with the proceeds of the offering. In addition, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nThe Company's board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over the Company, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, however, our board has delegated to MVP Realty Advisors, LLC, our advisor, authority to manage our day-to-day business, in accordance with our investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., (\"VRM II\") owns 60% of the Advisor, and the remaining 40% is owned by Vestin Realty Mortgage I, Inc. (\"VRM I\"); both are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC. The Company's sponsor is MVP Capital Partners, LLC (\"MVPCP\" or the \"Sponsor\"), an entity owned and managed by Michael V. Shustek, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Michael Shustek owns a significant majority of Vestin Mortgage, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, which is the manager of VRM I, and VRM II.\nVRM I, an OTC Pink Sheet-listed company, and VRM II, a Nasdaq-listed company that has provided notice of its intent to delist from Nasdaq on or about March 30, 2017, are engaged primarily in the business of investing in commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. As the owners of the Advisor, VRM I and VRM II may benefit from any fees and other compensation that the Company pays to the Advisor under the Advisor Agreement. In this regard, the Company notes that the Advisor has agreed to waive certain fees and expenses it otherwise would be entitled under the Advisory Agreement. Please refer to Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company in Part II, Item 8 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate amount of fees and expense reimbursements waived by the Advisor was approximately $6.9 million. If the owners of the Advisor determine that such waivers are no longer in the best interests of their stockholders or otherwise refuse to grant future waivers of fees or expenses if requested by the Company, then the Company's operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the amount of distributions to stockholders.\nIn addition, the Company may compete against MVP REIT II, VRM I and VRM II, all of whom are managed by affiliates of our sponsor, for the acquisition of investments. The Company believes this potential conflict with respect to VRM I and VRM II, is mitigated, in part, by the Company's focus on parking facilities as its core investments, while the investment strategy of VRM I and VRM II focuses on acquiring office buildings and other commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. MVP REIT II has substantially the same investment strategy as the Company, in that MVP REIT II is also focused primarily on investments in parking facilities. For additional discussion regarding potential conflicts of interests, please see \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest\" and \"Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nMVP has purchased the majority of the properties since January 1, 2015, and the results of operations below reflect start-up costs as well as acquisition expenses incurred in connection with purchasing properties as the Company deployed our offering proceeds. We expect that income and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future years as a result of owning the properties acquired for a full year and as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets. The results of operations described below may not be indicative of future results of operations.\nComparison of operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\n a) Includes percentage rent from properties where gross revenue was above the set threshold in 2016 as follows: \nMabley Place - $182,000\nIndy WA Street - $143,000\nSt. Louis - $68,000\nIndy Garage - $48,000\nSt. Louis Convention - $40,000\nSt. Louis Lucas - $31,000\nHouston Saks Garage - $11,000\nKC Cherry Lot - $3,000\n b) Includes percentage rent from properties where gross revenue was above the set threshold in 2015 as follows: \nMabley Place - $42,000\nSt. Louis - $64,000\nTotal rental revenue earned, for the year ended December 31, 2016, from our 27 consolidated properties which have continued operations, totaled $8.6 million, as compared to $4.7 million for the year ended 2015, and $0.7 million for the year ended 2014. The increase in total rental revenues is mainly due to the additional properties acquired by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. As the common stock offering has been closed since 2015 and the majority of the Company's capital has been deployed, we do not expect to see the similar growth in revenue that MVP experienced from 2014 to 2016, to continue in the foreseeable future. The Company does expect to see continued grow from percentage rent on many of our properties over the next few years, as the properties purchased during 2016 will see the end of their 1st lease contract year in 2017. This is when they will be eligible to received percentage rent.\nAssets purchased in 2012 and 2013 were sold as of December 31, 2015, and income from those investments is reported as income (loss) from assets held for sale in the discontinued operations, net of income taxes section of our consolidated statements of operations.\nSee Note I - Acquisitions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nIncrease in operating expenses is mainly due to the additional properties owned by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2016 the Company recorded a loss on impairment of $100,000 on Indy Meridian in accordance with an appraisal received during the 3rd quarter. In addition, the Company refinanced a loan on our Fort Worth property that was assumed when we purchased the property. The loan we assumed had an annual interest rate of 5.59% and matured in August 2021 with a balloon payment of approximated $10.2 million due at maturity. The new loan with American National Insurance Company (\"ANICO\") has an annual interest rate of 4.50%, will mature in November of 2026 and will have a balloon payment of approximately $9.5 million. As part of the refinancing of this loan the company was able to obtain an additional $0.5 million in loan proceeds for general repairs and maintenance to the Fort Worth property. The early extinguishment of the existing debt called for a prepayment penalty of approximately $587,000. Management believes that the extra money for repairs and maintenance, along with the lower interest rate for an additional five years, out weight the cost of the prepayment penalty and puts the property in a better position for the long term.\nSee Note I - Acquisitions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nInterest expense has increase from 2014 to 2016 due to the assumption of debt through acquisitions and adding new debt to acquisitions that were completed with cash previously. To maximize the use of our cash, the Company will continue to looks for opportunities to put financing in place on existing properties and future acquisitions. The interest expense will vary based on the amount of our borrowings and current interest rates at the time of financing. The Company will seek to secure appropriate leverage with the lowest interest rate available to us. The terms of the loans will greatly depend on the quality of the property, the credit worthiness of the tenant and the amount of income the property is able to generate through parking revenue. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all. Interest expense recorded for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, includes loan amortization costs. Total loan amortization cost over this period totaled approximately $195,000, $85,000 and $22,000, respectively.\nSee Note K - Notes Payable and Note M - Line of Credit of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had an 87.09% ownership interest in one property that was listed as held for sale, with a carrying value of approximately $6.1 million. This property was acquired on January 6, 2016, along with MVP REIT II, with the purchase of two parking lots located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This property is accounted for at the fair value based on an appraisal.\nDuring June 2016, Minneapolis Venture entered into a purchase and sales agreement (the \"PSA\") to sell the 10th Street lot \"as is\" to a third party for approximately $6.1 million, which was cancelled in October 2016. During February 2017, the Company entered into a letter of intent to sell a portion of the property (approximately 2.2 acres) to an unrelated third party for $3.0 million. The remaining portion of the property will be retained by the Company and will be leased to a parking operator.\nSee Note L - Assets Held for Sale of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the first and second quarters of 2014, the Company's Board approved a sale of its interest in six office buildings to VRM I and VRM II in exchange for VRM I and VRM II's interest in five parking facilities and a storage facility. Additionally, during June 2014, the Company's Board approved a sale of its interest in two additional office buildings to VRM I and VRM II. The net income from the office buildings is reported as discontinued operations. Subsequently, during January 2015, management entered into a plan to sell the storage unit assets resulting in the financial reporting of these assets, liabilities and results of operations related to the assets held for sale, as discontinued operations. The sale of the storage assets resulted in a gain on sale of investment in real estate held for sale of approximately $1.3 million.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe Advisor believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Additionally, publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, the Company believes that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nIn order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") promulgated a measure known as funds from operations (\"FFO\"). FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property, adding back asset impairment write-downs, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, the Company believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT\ndefinition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company does, making comparisons less meaningful.\nThe Investment Program Association (\"IPA\") issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 (the \"IPA MFFO Guideline\") on November 2, 2010, which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations (\"MFFO\"). In computing MFFO, FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent, amortization of in-place lease valuations, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss), and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Management is responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk. To achieve our objectives, the Company may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. In order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments, if any, the Company may enter into interest rate cap agreements and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency exposure, if any, the Company may enter into foreign currency hedges. The Company views fair value adjustments of derivatives, impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations, assessments regarding general market conditions, and the specific performance of properties owned, which can change over time. No less frequently than annually, the Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to any liquidity event.\nThe Company adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a helpful indicator of our on-going portfolio performance and ability to sustain our current distribution level. More specifically, MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT's operations. MFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or our future ability to pay our dividends. By providing FFO and MFFO, the Company presents information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management's analysis of long-term operating activities. MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of our portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions, as well as a comparison of our performance with that of other non-traded REITs, as MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and the Company believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. As explained below, management's evaluation of our operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations:\n \u00b7 Straight-line rent. Most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, these periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting. As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio. \n \u00b7 Amortization of in-place lease valuation. As this item is a cash flow adjustment made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio. \n \u00b7 Acquisition-related costs. The Company was organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property and loans secured by real estate in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders. In the process, the Company incurs non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs, which in accordance with GAAP, are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from the offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate. If the Company acquires a property after all offering proceeds from the offering have been invested, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to our Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. In evaluating the performance of our portfolio over time, management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments' revenues and expenses. Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect our operating results, cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired, as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets. By excluding acquisition-related costs, MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made. However, it can provide an indication of our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after the Company ceases to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis, which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours. Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management. \nFor all of these reasons, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO, in addition to income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO. Additionally, MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value. The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if the Company does not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed. However, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO. Therefore, FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other organization body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and the Company may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure.\nOur calculation of FFO and MFFO, attributable to common shareholders is presented in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\nCapital and Liquidity Resources\nThe Company commenced operations on December 11, 2012 and acquired our first property on December 14, 2012.\nOur principal demand for funds will be/and is for the acquisition of real estate assets, funding of loans secured by real estate, the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest on our outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions to our stockholders. Over time, the Company intends to generally fund its operating expenses from its cash flow from operations. The cash required for acquisitions and investments in real estate will be funded primarily from the sale of shares through our distribution reinvestment plan, dispositions of properties in our portfolio and through third party financing and the assumption of debt on acquired properties.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3.3 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses such as management fees, accounting fees and legal bills. Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $27.2 million and consisted mainly of cash used in investment of real estate of approximately $28.7 million of which approximately $16.0 million was applied to purchase from deposits in prior periods, investment in equity method investee of approximately $6.6 million, $6.1 million used in investment in real estate held for sale and approximately $1.5 million is on deposit for future acquisitions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $24.2 million and consisted of proceeds from notes payable of approximately $34.7 million, proceeds from line of credit of approximately $4.8 million, payments on redeemed shares of approximately $1.6 million, payments on notes payable of approximately $12.9 million, capital contributions from non-controlling interest-related party of approximately $4 million, purchase of non- controlling interest of approximately $0.8 million and distributions to stockholders and non-controlling interest of approximately $5.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.4 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses such as management fees, accounting fees, legal bills and expenses related to real estate owned held for sale. Operating cash flows were provided by the receipt of proceeds from our assets held for sale. Net cash used in investing activities consisted mainly of cash used in investment of real estate of approximately $48.6 million, deposits on future acquisitions of approximately $15.7 million and provided by proceeds from the sale of Red Mountain and Cedar Park of approximately $9.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of commissions of approximately $58.5 million and proceeds from a promissory note of approximately $3.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities consisted of payments on redeemed shares of approximately $0.4 million, payments on notes payable of approximately $0.7 million, payments on notes payable - held for sale of approximately $4.3 million and distributions to stockholders of approximately $2.9 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.8. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.6. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $17.7.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company has eight promissory notes in the aggregate amount of approximately $49.4 million, net of loan issuance costs, secured by our real estate. Our charter precludes us from borrowing more than the NASAA REIT Guidelines limit of 300% of our net assets, unless a majority of our independent directors approve any borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets and the justification for such excess borrowing is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report. The Company expects that it may use leverage for any senior debt or equity investments that the Company makes. The Company expects that our debt financing, if any, on such investments will not exceed 50% of the greater of the cost or fair market value of our overall investments.\nOn October 5, 2016, the Company, through its Operating LLC, and MVP REIT II, through a wholly owned subsidiary (the \"Borrowers\") entered into a credit agreement (the \"Unsecured Credit Agreement\") with KeyBank, National Association ('KeyBank\") as the administrative agent and KeyBanc Capital Markets (\"KeyBanc Capital Markets\") as the lead arranger. Pursuant to the Unsecured Credit Agreement, the Borrowers were provided with a $30 million unsecured credit facility (the \"Unsecured Credit Facility\"), which may be increased up to $100 million, in minimum increments of $10 million. The Unsecured Credit Facility has an initial term of two years, maturing on October 5, 2018, and may be extended for a one-year period if certain conditions are met and upon payment of an extension fee. The Unsecured Credit Facility has an annual interest rate calculated based on LIBOR Rate plus 2.25% or Base Rate plus 1.25%, both as provided in the Unsecured Credit Agreement. The Base Rate is calculated as the greater of (i) the KeyBank Prime rate or (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus \u00bd of 1%. Payments under the Unsecured Credit Facility are interest only and are due on the first day of each quarter. The obligations of the Borrowers of the Unsecured Credit Agreement are joint and several. The Borrowers have entered into cross-indemnification provisions with respect to their joint and several obligations under the Unsecured Credit Agreement.\nThe Company will experience a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate our assets and may experience a temporary, relative increase in liquidity if and when investments are sold, to the extent such sales generate proceeds that are available for additional investments. Our advisor may, but is not required to, establish working capital reserves from offering proceeds out of cash flow generated by our investments or out of proceeds from the sale of our investments. The Company also may, but is not required to, establish reserves out of cash flow generated by investments or out of net sale proceeds in non-liquidating sale transactions. Working capital reserves are typically utilized to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions and major capital expenditures. Our lenders also may require working capital reserves.\nTo the extent that the working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, additional funds may be provided from cash generated from operations or through short- term borrowing. In addition, subject to the limitations previously described in our prospectus, the Company may incur indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of any real estate asset, refinance the debt thereon, arrange for the leveraging of any previously unfinanced property or reinvest the proceeds of financing or refinancing in additional properties.\nIn addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, the Company expects to use its capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and the selling agent(s). During the organization and offering stage, these payments included payments to the selling agent(s) for selling commissions and payments to our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and offering expenses. During the acquisition and development stage, the Company expects to make payments to our advisor in connection with the selection or purchase of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us. For a discussion of the compensation to be paid to our advisor, see \" Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company\", included in Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our advisor and our board of directors.\nManagement Compensation Summary\nThe following table summarizes all compensation and fees incurred by us and paid or payable to our Advisor and its affiliates in connection with our organization, our initial public offering and our operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\nDistributions\nThe Company intends to continue making regular cash distributions to its stockholders, typically on a monthly basis. The actual amount and timing of distributions will be determined by our board of directors in its discretion and typically will depend on the amount of funds available for distribution, which is impacted by current and projected cash requirements, tax considerations and other factors. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company must make distributions equal to at least 90% of its \"REIT taxable income\" each year.\nOn October 3, 2012, the Company confirmed that its board of directors had approved a plan for payment of initial monthly cash distributions of $0.045 per share. On January 25, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that its board of directors had approved an increase in its monthly distribution rate on its common shares to an annualized distribution rate of 6.2 percent, or $0.558 per share annually and $0.0465 per share monthly, assuming a purchase price of $9.00 per share. The distribution rate, which had previously been 6 percent, increased beginning with the January 2013 distribution. On June 4, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that its board of directors has approved an increase in its monthly distribution rate on its common shares to an annualized distribution rate of 6.7%, or $0.60 per share annually and $0.05025 monthly assuming a purchase price of $9.00 per share. The Company anticipates paying future distributions monthly in arrears, with a record date on the 24th of each month and distributions paid on the 10th day of the following month (or the next business day if the 10th is not a business day). Starting April 11, 2016, the NAV of $9.14 per common share has been used for purposes of effectuating permitted redemptions of the Company's common stock and issuing shares pursuant to the Company's distribution reinvestment plan.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2016, the Company has paid approximately $13.6 million in distributions including approximately $2.9 million in DRIP distributions to the Company's stockholders, all of which have constituted a return of capital. Our total distributions paid for the period presented, the sources of such distributions, the cash flows used in operations and the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, are detailed below.\nTo date, the all of distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and represent a return of capital.\n\n\n\nThe Company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions. We may continue to pay all or a portion of the distributions from other sources, such as cash flows from offering proceeds, financing activities, borrowings, cash advances from our Advisor, or by way of waiver or deferral of fees. The Company has not established any limit on the extent to which distributions could be funded from these other sources. Accordingly, the amount of distributions paid may not reflect current cash flow from operations and distributions may include a return of capital, rather than a return on capital. If the Company continues to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, the funds available to the Company for investments would be reduced and the share value may be diluted. The level of distributions will be determined by the board of directors and depend on a number of factors including current and projected liquidity requirements, anticipated operating cash flows and tax considerations, and other relevant items deemed applicable by the board of directors.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Arrangements\nOn November 5, 2016, MVP REIT II, Inc. purchased 338,409 shares of MVP REIT, Inc's common stock from an unrelated third party for $3.0 million or $8.865 per share. During the year ended, the Company paid MVP REIT II, approximately $34,000 in distributions, related to their ownership of the Company's common stock.\nFor more information, see Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees\nInflation\nThe Company expects to include provisions in its tenant leases designed to protect the Company from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is organized and conducts operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") and to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with respect thereto. A REIT is generally not", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the \"Selected Financial Data\" above and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Also see \"Forward Looking Statements\" preceding Part I.\nOverview\nMVP REIT, Inc. (the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") was incorporated on April 3, 2012 as a Maryland corporation, and has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Pursuant to its initial public offering, which closed in September 2015, the Company received net consideration of approximately $97.3 million for the issuance of its common stock. Of this amount, approximately $19.5 million of common shares were issued in consideration of the contribution of commercial properties to the Company. The Company has also registered up to $50 million for the issuance of common stock pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the \"DRIP\") under which common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock.\nThe Company's investment strategy was to invest available net proceeds from its offering in direct investments in real property and real estate secured loans that meet the Company's investment objectives and strategies. In March 2014, the Company's board of directors approved a plan to increase the focus of the Company's investment strategy on parking and self- storage facilities located throughout the United States as the Company's core assets. In June 2014, the Company's board decided to further focus the Company's investments primarily on parking facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, MVP REIT acquired an ownership interest in the following properties:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> Property Name\n</td> <td> MVP REIT\n%\n</td> <td> MVP REIT II %\n</td> <td> Total Purchase Price\n</td> <td> Purchase Date\n</td> <td> Property Type\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated Properties listed as investments in real estate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Indianapolis Meridian\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td> $1,550,000\n</td> <td> 1/15/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Milwaukee Clybourn\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td> $205,000\n</td> <td> 1/20/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Milwaukee Arena\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td> $3,900,000\n</td> <td> 2/1/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Clarksburg\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td> $620,000\n</td> <td> 2/9/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Bridgeport Fairfield Garage\n</td> <td> 90.0%\n</td> <td> 10.0%\n</td> <td> $7,800,000\n</td> <td> 3/30/2016\n</td> <td> Garage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minneapolis City Parking\n</td> <td> 87.0%\n</td> <td> 13.0%\n</td> <td> $9,395,000\n</td> <td> 1/6/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Houston Preston Lot\n</td> <td> 80.0%\n</td> <td> 20.0%\n</td> <td> $2,800,000\n</td> <td> 11/22/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Denver Sherman 1935\n</td> <td> 76.0%\n</td> <td> 24.0%\n</td> <td> $2,437,500\n</td> <td> 2/12/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment in equity method investee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Cleveland West 9th (1)\n</td> <td> 49.0%\n</td> <td> 51.0%\n</td> <td> $5,675,000\n</td> <td> 5/11/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 33740 Crown Colony (1)\n</td> <td> 49.0%\n</td> <td> 51.0%\n</td> <td> $3,030,000\n</td> <td> 5/17/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> White Front Garage Partners\n</td> <td> 20.0%\n</td> <td> 80.0%\n</td> <td> $11,496,000\n</td> <td> 9/30/2016\n</td> <td> Garage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assets held for sale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVP Minneapolis Venture\n</td> <td> 87.0%\n</td> <td> 13.0%\n</td> <td> $6,100,000\n</td> <td> 1/6/2016\n</td> <td> Lot\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty information continued:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> Property Name\n</td> <td> #

The Company owns a 20% equity interest in the MVP Detroit Center and MVP REIT II owns an 80% equity interest. The parking garage will be operated by SP Plus Corporation (\"SP+\") under a long-term lease, where SP+ will be responsible for the first $572,000 in property taxes, pay annual base rent of $3.4 million, and 80% of all gross revenue above $5.0 million. As part of the acquisition MVP Detroit Center entered into a $31.5 million loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A., with a term of 10 years, amortized over 25 years, with monthly principal and interest payments totaling approximately $194,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 5.52%, secured by the parking garage, and maturing in February 2027.\nSince a majority of our property leases call for additional percentage rent, MVP monitors the gross revenue generated by each property on a monthly basis. The higher the property's gross revenue the higher our potential percentage rent. Below is graph showing the comparison of our monthly rental income to the gross revenue generated by the properties.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company held a 51% or more interest in 27 properties (out of 30 total investments), with initial purchase prices totaling approximately $122 million, of which our portion was $115.8 million. Of those 27 properties; 21 were owned 100% by us, three properties had common ownership with MVP REIT II and one had common ownership with an unrelated third party. One of the properties owned by us and MVP REIT II is currently listed for sale at $6.1 million. In addition, MVP held a less than 50% ownership in three properties, where MVP REIT II owned the majority share, of which our share of the purchase price was approximately $6.6 million. These properties were acquired with funds from the initial public offering, third party financing and the assumption of existing liabilities\nThe Company may, from time to time, invest in non-core assets, including investments in companies that manage real estate or mortgage investment companies; however, the Company anticipates that its core investments going forward will be predominantly in parking facilities. In addition, the Company has agreed that no more than 25% of the gross proceeds from its initial public offering will be used to invest in real properties other than parking facilities.\nAs previously reported, on March 7, 2016, the Company's board of directors approved taking the necessary action to list its common shares on the NASDAQ Global Market with view to providing a liquidity opportunity for its stockholders. In connection with the action to list the shares, on May 5, 2016, the Company's board of directors suspended the Company's distribution reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\"). In June 2016, the Company and MVP REIT II, jointly announced the engagement of Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. to assist in evaluating various courses of action intended to enhance stockholder liquidity and value. In connection with the engagement, the Company decided to defer taking further action to list the Company's common shares on the NASDAQ Global Market until Ladenburg Thalmann completes its evaluation. After reviewing the Ladenburg Thalmann's completed evaluation, the Company's board of directors will decide whether to proceed with a listing on the NASDAQ Global Market or take other action to enhance stockholder liquidity and value. The Company currently expects that no decision on this matter will be made until the second fiscal quarter of 2017. Following the Company's engagement of Ladenburg Thalmann, the Company's board of directors approved the reinstatement DRIP in July 2016, since no decision on liquidity is expected until the second fiscal quarter of 2017. There can be no assurance as to if or when the Company will again pursue a listing or another liquidity transaction.\nThe Company operates as a REIT. The Company is not a mutual fund or an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, nor is the Company subject to any regulation thereunder. As a REIT, the Company is required to have a December 31 fiscal year end. As a REIT, the Company will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed to stockholders. Among other requirements, REITs are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests, which may affect the composition of assets the Company acquires with the proceeds of the offering. In addition, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nThe Company's board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over the Company, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, however, our board has delegated to MVP Realty Advisors, LLC, our advisor, authority to manage our day-to-day business, in accordance with our investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations. Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., (\"VRM II\") owns 60% of the Advisor, and the remaining 40% is owned by Vestin Realty Mortgage I, Inc. (\"VRM I\"); both are managed by Vestin Mortgage, LLC. The Company's sponsor is MVP Capital Partners, LLC (\"MVPCP\" or the \"Sponsor\"), an entity owned and managed by Michael V. Shustek, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Michael Shustek owns a significant majority of Vestin Mortgage, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, which is the manager of VRM I, and VRM II.\nVRM I, an OTC Pink Sheet-listed company, and VRM II, a Nasdaq-listed company that has provided notice of its intent to delist from Nasdaq on or about March 30, 2017, are engaged primarily in the business of investing in commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. As the owners of the Advisor, VRM I and VRM II may benefit from any fees and other compensation that the Company pays to the Advisor under the Advisor Agreement. In this regard, the Company notes that the Advisor has agreed to waive certain fees and expenses it otherwise would be entitled under the Advisory Agreement. Please refer to Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company in Part II, Item 8 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate amount of fees and expense reimbursements waived by the Advisor was approximately $6.9 million. If the owners of the Advisor determine that such waivers are no longer in the best interests of their stockholders or otherwise refuse to grant future waivers of fees or expenses if requested by the Company, then the Company's operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the amount of distributions to stockholders.\nIn addition, the Company may compete against MVP REIT II, VRM I and VRM II, all of whom are managed by affiliates of our sponsor, for the acquisition of investments. The Company believes this potential conflict with respect to VRM I and VRM II, is mitigated, in part, by the Company's focus on parking facilities as its core investments, while the investment strategy of VRM I and VRM II focuses on acquiring office buildings and other commercial real estate and loans secured by commercial real estate. MVP REIT II has substantially the same investment strategy as the Company, in that MVP REIT II is also focused primarily on investments in parking facilities. For additional discussion regarding potential conflicts of interests, please see \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest\" and \"Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nMVP has purchased the majority of the properties since January 1, 2015, and the results of operations below reflect start-up costs as well as acquisition expenses incurred in connection with purchasing properties as the Company deployed our offering proceeds. We expect that income and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future years as a result of owning the properties acquired for a full year and as a result of anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets. The results of operations described below may not be indicative of future results of operations.\nComparison of operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> Rental revenues (by property)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ft.

The increase in total rental revenues is mainly due to the additional properties acquired by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. As the common stock offering has been closed since 2015 and the majority of the Company's capital has been deployed, we do not expect to see the similar growth in revenue that MVP experienced from 2014 to 2016, to continue in the foreseeable future. The Company does expect to see continued grow from percentage rent on many of our properties over the next few years, as the properties purchased during 2016 will see the end of their 1st lease contract year in 2017. This is when they will be eligible to received percentage rent.\nAssets purchased in 2012 and 2013 were sold as of December 31, 2015, and income from those investments is reported as income (loss) from assets held for sale in the discontinued operations, net of income taxes section of our consolidated statements of operations.\nSee Note I - Acquisitions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,791,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 910,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 775,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of investment in real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,081,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 678,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 235,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition expenses - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,458,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,649,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,898,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operation and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,980,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 421,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 43,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operation and maintenance - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,055,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 566,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 379,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan payoff fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 587,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,263,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 799,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,315,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,023,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,374,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncrease in operating expenses is mainly due to the additional properties owned by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2016 the Company recorded a loss on impairment of $100,000 on Indy Meridian in accordance with an appraisal received during the 3rd quarter. In addition, the Company refinanced a loan on our Fort Worth property that was assumed when we purchased the property. The loan we assumed had an annual interest rate of 5.59% and matured in August 2021 with a balloon payment of approximated $10.2 million due at maturity. The new loan with American National Insurance Company (\"ANICO\") has an annual interest rate of 4.50%, will mature in November of 2026 and will have a balloon payment of approximately $9.5 million. As part of the refinancing of this loan the company was able to obtain an additional $0.5 million in loan proceeds for general repairs and maintenance to the Fort Worth property. The early extinguishment of the existing debt called for a prepayment penalty of approximately $587,000. Management believes that the extra money for repairs and maintenance, along with the lower interest rate for an additional five years, out weight the cost of the prepayment penalty and puts the property in a better position for the long term.\nSee Note I - Acquisitions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 2, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> Other income and (expense)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,381,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,313,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (169,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from investment in equity method investee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 116,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on acquisition of investment real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 127,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,266,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,313,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (36,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense has increase from 2014 to 2016 due to the assumption of debt through acquisitions and adding new debt to acquisitions that were completed with cash previously. To maximize the use of our cash, the Company will continue to looks for opportunities to put financing in place on existing properties and future acquisitions. The interest expense will vary based on the amount of our borrowings and current interest rates at the time of financing. The Company will seek to secure appropriate leverage with the lowest interest rate available to us. The terms of the loans will greatly depend on the quality of the property, the credit worthiness of the tenant and the amount of income the property is able to generate through parking revenue. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all. Interest expense recorded for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, includes loan amortization costs. Total loan amortization cost over this period totaled approximately $195,000, $85,000 and $22,000, respectively.\nSee Note K - Notes Payable and Note M - Line of Credit of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> Discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from assets held for sale, net of income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (244,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 214,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 876,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of investment in real estate held for sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,260,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total income (loss) from discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (244,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,474,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 920,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had an 87.09% ownership interest in one property that was listed as held for sale, with a carrying value of approximately $6.1 million. This property was acquired on January 6, 2016, along with MVP REIT II, with the purchase of two parking lots located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This property is accounted for at the fair value based on an appraisal.\nDuring June 2016, Minneapolis Venture entered into a purchase and sales agreement (the \"PSA\") to sell the 10th Street lot \"as is\" to a third party for approximately $6.1 million, which was cancelled in October 2016. During February 2017, the Company entered into a letter of intent to sell a portion of the property (approximately 2.2 acres) to an unrelated third party for $3.0 million. The remaining portion of the property will be retained by the Company and will be leased to a parking operator.\nSee Note L - Assets Held for Sale of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the first and second quarters of 2014, the Company's Board approved a sale of its interest in six office buildings to VRM I and VRM II in exchange for VRM I and VRM II's interest in five parking facilities and a storage facility. Additionally, during June 2014, the Company's Board approved a sale of its interest in two additional office buildings to VRM I and VRM II. The net income from the office buildings is reported as discontinued operations. Subsequently, during January 2015, management entered into a plan to sell the storage unit assets resulting in the financial reporting of these assets, liabilities and results of operations related to the assets held for sale, as discontinued operations. The sale of the storage assets resulted in a gain on sale of investment in real estate held for sale of approximately $1.3 million.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe Advisor believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Additionally, publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, the Company believes that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.\nIn order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") promulgated a measure known as funds from operations (\"FFO\"). FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property, adding back asset impairment write-downs, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, the Company believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT\ndefinition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company does, making comparisons less meaningful.\nThe Investment Program Association (\"IPA\") issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 (the \"IPA MFFO Guideline\") on November 2, 2010, which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations (\"MFFO\"). In computing MFFO, FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent, amortization of in-place lease valuations, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss), and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Management is responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk. To achieve our objectives, the Company may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. In order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments, if any, the Company may enter into interest rate cap agreements and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency exposure, if any, the Company may enter into foreign currency hedges. The Company views fair value adjustments of derivatives, impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations, assessments regarding general market conditions, and the specific performance of properties owned, which can change over time. No less frequently than annually, the Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to any liquidity event.\nThe Company adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a helpful indicator of our on-going portfolio performance and ability to sustain our current distribution level. More specifically, MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT's operations. MFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or our future ability to pay our dividends. By providing FFO and MFFO, the Company presents information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management's analysis of long-term operating activities. MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of our portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions, as well as a comparison of our performance with that of other non-traded REITs, as MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and the Company believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. As explained below, management's evaluation of our operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations:\n \u00b7 Straight-line rent. Most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, these periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting. As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio. \n \u00b7 Amortization of in-place lease valuation. As this item is a cash flow adjustment made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, it is added back to FFO to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio. \n \u00b7 Acquisition-related costs. The Company was organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property and loans secured by real estate in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders. In the process, the Company incurs non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs, which in accordance with GAAP, are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from the offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate. If the Company acquires a property after all offering proceeds from the offering have been invested, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to our Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. In evaluating the performance of our portfolio over time, management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments' revenues and expenses. Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect our operating results, cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired, as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets. By excluding acquisition-related costs, MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made. However, it can provide an indication of our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after the Company ceases to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis, which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours. Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management. \nFor all of these reasons, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO, in addition to income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO. Additionally, MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value. The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if the Company does not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed. However, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO. Therefore, FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other organization body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and the Company may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure.\nOur calculation of FFO and MFFO, attributable to common shareholders is presented in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss attributable to MVP REIT, Inc. common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,266,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,360,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,837,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtract:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in deferred rental assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (132,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (332,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on Sale of REO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,260,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (44,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,263,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 799,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discontinued operations loss (income)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 244,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (214,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (876,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan payoff fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 587,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment write-downs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,006,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,167,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,045,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses to non-affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,081,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 678,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 235,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses to affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,458,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,649,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,898,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MFFO attributable to MVP REIT, Inc common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,533,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,160,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (912,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital and Liquidity Resources\nThe Company commenced operations on December 11, 2012 and acquired our first property on December 14, 2012.\nOur principal demand for funds will be/and is for the acquisition of real estate assets, funding of loans secured by real estate, the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest on our outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions to our stockholders. Over time, the Company intends to generally fund its operating expenses from its cash flow from operations. The cash required for acquisitions and investments in real estate will be funded primarily from the sale of shares through our distribution reinvestment plan, dispositions of properties in our portfolio and through third party financing and the assumption of debt on acquired properties.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3.3 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses such as management fees, accounting fees and legal bills. Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $27.2 million and consisted mainly of cash used in investment of real estate of approximately $28.7 million of which approximately $16.0 million was applied to purchase from deposits in prior periods, investment in equity method investee of approximately $6.6 million, $6.1 million used in investment in real estate held for sale and approximately $1.5 million is on deposit for future acquisitions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $24.2 million and consisted of proceeds from notes payable of approximately $34.7 million, proceeds from line of credit of approximately $4.8 million, payments on redeemed shares of approximately $1.6 million, payments on notes payable of approximately $12.9 million, capital contributions from non-controlling interest-related party of approximately $4 million, purchase of non- controlling interest of approximately $0.8 million and distributions to stockholders and non-controlling interest of approximately $5.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.4 million. Operating cash flows were used for the payment of normal operating expenses such as management fees, accounting fees, legal bills and expenses related to real estate owned held for sale. Operating cash flows were provided by the receipt of proceeds from our assets held for sale. Net cash used in investing activities consisted mainly of cash used in investment of real estate of approximately $48.6 million, deposits on future acquisitions of approximately $15.7 million and provided by proceeds from the sale of Red Mountain and Cedar Park of approximately $9.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of commissions of approximately $58.5 million and proceeds from a promissory note of approximately $3.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities consisted of payments on redeemed shares of approximately $0.4 million, payments on notes payable of approximately $0.7 million, payments on notes payable - held for sale of approximately $4.3 million and distributions to stockholders of approximately $2.9 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.8. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.6. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $17.7.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company has eight promissory notes in the aggregate amount of approximately $49.4 million, net of loan issuance costs, secured by our real estate. Our charter precludes us from borrowing more than the NASAA REIT Guidelines limit of 300% of our net assets, unless a majority of our independent directors approve any borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets and the justification for such excess borrowing is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report. The Company expects that it may use leverage for any senior debt or equity investments that the Company makes. The Company expects that our debt financing, if any, on such investments will not exceed 50% of the greater of the cost or fair market value of our overall investments.\nOn October 5, 2016, the Company, through its Operating LLC, and MVP REIT II, through a wholly owned subsidiary (the \"Borrowers\") entered into a credit agreement (the \"Unsecured Credit Agreement\") with KeyBank, National Association ('KeyBank\") as the administrative agent and KeyBanc Capital Markets (\"KeyBanc Capital Markets\") as the lead arranger. Pursuant to the Unsecured Credit Agreement, the Borrowers were provided with a $30 million unsecured credit facility (the \"Unsecured Credit Facility\"), which may be increased up to $100 million, in minimum increments of $10 million. The Unsecured Credit Facility has an initial term of two years, maturing on October 5, 2018, and may be extended for a one-year period if certain conditions are met and upon payment of an extension fee. The Unsecured Credit Facility has an annual interest rate calculated based on LIBOR Rate plus 2.25% or Base Rate plus 1.25%, both as provided in the Unsecured Credit Agreement. The Base Rate is calculated as the greater of (i) the KeyBank Prime rate or (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus \u00bd of 1%. Payments under the Unsecured Credit Facility are interest only and are due on the first day of each quarter. The obligations of the Borrowers of the Unsecured Credit Agreement are joint and several. The Borrowers have entered into cross-indemnification provisions with respect to their joint and several obligations under the Unsecured Credit Agreement.\nThe Company will experience a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate our assets and may experience a temporary, relative increase in liquidity if and when investments are sold, to the extent such sales generate proceeds that are available for additional investments. Our advisor may, but is not required to, establish working capital reserves from offering proceeds out of cash flow generated by our investments or out of proceeds from the sale of our investments. The Company also may, but is not required to, establish reserves out of cash flow generated by investments or out of net sale proceeds in non-liquidating sale transactions. Working capital reserves are typically utilized to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions and major capital expenditures. Our lenders also may require working capital reserves.\nTo the extent that the working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, additional funds may be provided from cash generated from operations or through short- term borrowing. In addition, subject to the limitations previously described in our prospectus, the Company may incur indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of any real estate asset, refinance the debt thereon, arrange for the leveraging of any previously unfinanced property or reinvest the proceeds of financing or refinancing in additional properties.\nIn addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, the Company expects to use its capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and the selling agent(s). During the organization and offering stage, these payments included payments to the selling agent(s) for selling commissions and payments to our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and offering expenses. During the acquisition and development stage, the Company expects to make payments to our advisor in connection with the selection or purchase of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us. For a discussion of the compensation to be paid to our advisor, see \" Fees and Expenses Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company\", included in Note E - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our advisor and our board of directors.\nManagement Compensation Summary\nThe following table summarizes all compensation and fees incurred by us and paid or payable to our Advisor and its affiliates in connection with our organization, our initial public offering and our operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling Commissions - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition Fees - related party\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,458,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,649,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,898,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset Management Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 941,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 500,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 350,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt Financing Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 114,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,513,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,215,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,279,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistributions\nThe Company intends to continue making regular cash distributions to its stockholders, typically on a monthly basis. The actual amount and timing of distributions will be determined by our board of directors in its discretion and typically will depend on the amount of funds available for distribution, which is impacted by current and projected cash requirements, tax considerations and other factors. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, the Company must make distributions equal to at least 90% of its \"REIT taxable income\" each year.\nOn October 3, 2012, the Company confirmed that its board of directors had approved a plan for payment of initial monthly cash distributions of $0.045 per share. On January 25, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that its board of directors had approved an increase in its monthly distribution rate on its common shares to an annualized distribution rate of 6.2 percent, or $0.558 per share annually and $0.0465 per share monthly, assuming a purchase price of $9.00 per share. The distribution rate, which had previously been 6 percent, increased beginning with the January 2013 distribution. On June 4, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that its board of directors has approved an increase in its monthly distribution rate on its common shares to an annualized distribution rate of 6.7%, or $0.60 per share annually and $0.05025 monthly assuming a purchase price of $9.00 per share. The Company anticipates paying future distributions monthly in arrears, with a record date on the 24th of each month and distributions paid on the 10th day of the following month (or the next business day if the 10th is not a business day). Starting April 11, 2016, the NAV of $9.14 per common share has been used for purposes of effectuating permitted redemptions of the Company's common stock and issuing shares pursuant to the Company's distribution reinvestment plan.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2016, the Company has paid approximately $13.6 million in distributions including approximately $2.9 million in DRIP distributions to the Company's stockholders, all of which have constituted a return of capital. Our total distributions paid for the period presented, the sources of such distributions, the cash flows used in operations and the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, are detailed below.\nTo date, the all of distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and represent a return of capital.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

from operations to fully fund distributions. We may continue to pay all or a portion of the distributions from other sources, such as cash flows from offering proceeds, financing activities, borrowings, cash advances from our Advisor, or by way of waiver or deferral of fees. The Company has not established any limit on the extent to which distributions could be funded from these other sources.
