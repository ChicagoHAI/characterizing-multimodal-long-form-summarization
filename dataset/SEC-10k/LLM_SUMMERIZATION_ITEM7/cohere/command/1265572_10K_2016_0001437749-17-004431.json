This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth under Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe currently own and operate 45 restaurants located in 23 states and Puerto Rico. Over the past three years, we have grown organically through opening new restaurants. We achieved a unit growth rate of 22% for 2016, with eight openings during the year and 23% unit growth in 2015 with seven restaurant openings. We plan to open three restaurants during 2017, which is below our previous targeted growth rate of 20%. We believe that a more modest growth rate will provide us the flexibility to allocate capital resources, increase our earnings and strengthen our balance sheet as well as to focus our time and attention on new restaurant operations and performance.\nWe continue to execute our strategy for international market expansion. Given the strength our concept has enjoyed thus far in the U.S. and the increased demand for upscale casual dining concepts overseas, we believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our concept in Latin America, the Middle East and beyond. In February 2016, we announced an agreement for the development of six Kona Grill restaurants in Mexico and in April 2016, we signed an agreement for the development of six Kona Grill restaurants in the United Arab Emirates. We expect each of our international franchise partners to open a Kona Grill restaurant in their respective country during 2017.\nWe continue to focus on growing sales and successfully opening new restaurants. Our same-store sales increased 0.5% year over year, with 2.4% growth in check average partially offsetting a 1.9% decrease in customer traffic. We have generated positive same-store sales in each of the past six years.\nOur restaurant operating profit, defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales, labor, occupancy, and restaurant operating expenses, increased to $23.7 million or 2.0% from $23.2 million in 2015. Restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales of 14.0% in 2016 included new restaurant operating inefficiencies for 12 locations that opened since October 2015. Restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales of 16.2% in 2015 included new restaurant operating inefficiencies for 10 locations opened since October 2014. See Key Measures\u201d and Financial Performance Overview\u201d below for further information on restaurant operating profit and Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation to income (loss) from operations.\nOur cost of sales, labor, and other operating expenses for our restaurants open at least 12 months generally trend consistently with restaurant sales, and we analyze those costs as a percentage of restaurant sales. Our typical new restaurants experience gradually increasing unit volumes as customers discover our concept and we generate market awareness. We anticipate that our new restaurants will take up to twelve months to achieve the majority of operating efficiencies as a result of challenges typically associated with opening and operating new restaurants, including lack of market recognition and the need to hire and sufficiently train employees, as well as other factors. We expect cost of sales and labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales to be higher when we open a new restaurant, but to decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as the restaurant matures and as the restaurant management and employees become more efficient in operating that unit. Occupancy and a portion of restaurant operating expenses are fixed. As a result, the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had, and is expected to continue to have, an impact on cost of sales, labor, occupancy, and restaurant operating expenses measured as a percentage of restaurant sales which we expect will continue until these restaurants mature.\nKey Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Company\nKey measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following:\nNumber of Restaurant Openings. Number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period.\nSame-Store Sales Percentage Change. Same-store sales percentage change reflects the periodic change in restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base. In calculating the percentage change in same-store sales, we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than 18 months. We adjust the sales included in the same-store sales calculation for restaurant closures, primarily as a result of remodels, so that the periods will be comparable. Same-store sales growth can be generated by an increase in customer traffic counts or by increases in the per person average check amount. Menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold can affect the per person average check amount.\nOperating Weeks. Operating weeks represent the number of weeks that our restaurants were open during the reporting period.\nSales per Square Foot. Sales per square foot is a measure of a restaurant's productivity and represents the amount of sales generated for each square foot.\nAverage Unit Volume. Average unit volume represents the average restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base.\nRestaurant Operating Profit. Restaurant operating profit is defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales, labor, occupancy, and restaurant operating expenses. Restaurant operating profit does not include general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, or preopening expenses. We believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency, and performance prior to application of corporate overhead. We use restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants' financial performance compared with our competitors. This measure provides useful information regarding our financial condition and results of operations and allows investors to better determine future financial results driven by growth and to compare restaurant level profitability.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus the sum of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus preopening expense, asset impairment charge, stock-based compensation, and unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because: (i) we believe it is a useful measure for investors to assess the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses and stock-based compensation as well as the costs of opening new restaurants; (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness; and (iii) we use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance and compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nKey Financial Definitions\nRestaurant Sales. Restaurant sales include gross food and beverage sales, net of promotions and discounts.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales consists of food and beverage costs and related delivery fees.\nLabor. Labor includes all direct and indirect labor costs incurred in operations.\nOccupancy. Occupancy includes all rent payments associated with the leasing of real estate, including base, percentage and straight-line rent, real estate taxes, and common area maintenance expense. We record tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense over the term of the lease.\nRestaurant Operating Expenses. Restaurant operating expenses consist of all other restaurant-level operating costs, the major components of which are utilities, credit card fees, advertising, supplies, marketing, repair and maintenance, and other expenses. Other operating expenses contain both variable and fixed components.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative includes all corporate and administrative functions that support operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth. Components of this category include management and staff salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and related employee benefits, travel, information systems, corporate rent, professional and consulting fees, and corporate insurance costs.\nPreopening Expense. Preopening expense consists of costs incurred prior to opening a new restaurant and is comprised principally of manager salaries, payroll and related training costs for new employees, including food and beverage costs associated with practice and rehearsal of service activities, and rent expense incurred from the date we obtain possession of the property until opening. We expense restaurant preopening expenses as incurred. We expect preopening expenses to commence six to eight months prior to a restaurant opening. Although the actual preopening expenses for a particular location depend upon numerous factors, our historical cash preopening expenses average approximately $450,000 per location, and non-cash preopening rent expense typically ranges from $50,000 to $100,000 per location. Our preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the number of restaurants opened, the timing of new restaurant openings, the location of the restaurants, and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense consists of the depreciation of property and equipment. Depreciation and amortization expense also includes gains or losses on the disposal of fixed assets, primarily associated with remodel activities.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense consists of the cost of servicing our debt obligations, the amortization of debt issuance costs and commitment fees on the line of credit. Interest expense is offset by interest earned on cash and investment balances. We capitalize interest incurred on borrowings for restaurant construction.\nIncome Tax Expense. Expense for income taxes represents amounts due for federal and state income taxes.\nFinancial Performance Overview\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our financial

Sales. Restaurant sales increased 18.5% to $169.5 million during 2016 from $143.0 million in 2015, primarily due to a 24% increase in the number of operating weeks and same-store sales growth of 0.5% year over year. The increase is primarily due to restaurant sales generated by eight restaurants opened during 2016 and a full year of sales for seven restaurants that opened during 2015.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased $6.5 million, or 16.8% to $45.3 million in 2016 compared to $38.8 million in 2015, with the increase primarily attributable to our new locations opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. As a percentage of restaurant sales, cost of sales was 26.7% compared to 27.1% in the prior year, primarily reflecting improved kitchen efficiencies and favorable commodity pricing for poultry, produce and dairy products compared to 2015.\nLabor. Labor expense for our restaurants increased to $62.0 million from $50.2 million in 2015, an increase of 23.6%, primarily due to the twelve new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. Labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to 36.6% compared to 35.1% in the prior year, reflecting labor inefficiencies from our newly opened locations, increased wage costs due to certain state or local mandated minimum wage increases and a competitive labor market, and higher benefit costs. We expect labor cost as a percentage of sales to typically trend higher upon opening and gradually improve as our new restaurant management and employees become more efficient in operating their restaurants.\nOccupancy. Occupancy expenses increased $3.2 million or 30.6% to $13.8 million year over year, primarily associated with base rent and common area maintenance charges for twelve new locations opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. Occupancy expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were 8.1% in 2016 compared to 7.4% in 2015.\nRestaurant Operating Expenses. Restaurant operating expenses increased $4.4 million, or 21.9%, to $24.7 million in 2016, primarily due to the additional operating expenses for twelve new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. Restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were 14.6% and 14.2% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The year over year increase was driven in part by higher repair and maintenance costs, marketing expenses, professional services and training-related travel costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars by $0.7 million, or 5.2% to $13.3 million from $12.6 million year over year; however, these expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to 7.8% in 2016 compared to 8.8% in the prior year. Increased payroll, benefit costs and recruiting fees associated with additional headcount to support our unit growth expansion, higher audit fees and increased legal and professional fees contributed to the year over year increase in absolute dollars, partially offset by lower incentive compensation.\nPreopening Expense. Preopening expense was $4.5 million in 2016 compared to $4.7 million in 2015, including non-cash rent of $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Preopening expense in 2016 related to our Irvine, Fairfax, and Minnetonka restaurants opened in the second quarter of 2016, the Nashville, and Waikiki restaurants opened in the third quarter of 2016, and the Huntsville, Winter Park, and San Antonio locations opened in the fourth quarter of 2016, in addition to non-cash rent for two openings scheduled for the first half of 2017. Preopening expense in 2015 related to our San Juan restaurant opened in the first quarter of 2015, the Plano and Arlington restaurants opened in the second quarter of 2015, the Miami, Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Friendswood locations opened in the fourth quarter of 2015 and preparations for openings in the first half of 2016.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.4 million or 44.7% to $14.4 million year over year, primarily attributable to the incremental depreciation expense for eight restaurants opened during 2016 and a full year of depreciation expense for seven restaurants that opened during 2015 as well as depreciation expense associated with the Boca Park and Kansas City remodels. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales was 8.5% and 7.0% of restaurant sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAsset Impairment Charge. During 2016, we recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of $12.5 million related to the write-down of certain long-lived assets associated with five underperforming restaurants. The asset impairment charges were based upon an assessment of each restaurant's historical operating performance combined with expected cash flows for that restaurants over the respective remaining lease term. We have no plans to close any of these restaurants; however, we will continue to evaluate each of these restaurants to determine whether operating performance can be improved.\nOther Expenses. Other expenses of $0.2 million in 2015 primarily related to an expected settlement of a state use tax audit.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense increased to $0.6 million year-over-year due to borrowings under the credit facility. We used the majority of the borrowings to fund new restaurant construction and remodel activities in 2016. We did not borrow from the credit facility during 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense. We recorded income tax expense of $66,000 and $43,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income tax expense for 2016 and 2015 relate to state income tax expense for which no net operating loss carryforwards or other credits exist partially offset by refunds primarily associated with previous year state income tax. We did not recognize any federal income tax benefit in 2016 or 2015 due to projected net operating loss carryforwards expected to be generated from tax planning strategies and available credits to offset taxable income.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRestaurant Sales. Restaurant sales increased $23.9 million or 20.1% in 2015, primarily attributable to a 19.4% increase in the number of operating weeks. Our same-store sales increased 2.0% year over year, with a 2.6% growth in average check resulting from a 1.5% menu price increase in April 2015 and a shift in menu mix partially offset by a 0.6% decrease in customer traffic. The 2.0% same-store sales growth in 2015 compares to a 3.8% increase in same-store sales in 2014.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased $5.8 million, or 17.7% to $38.8 million in 2015 compared to $33.0 million in 2014, with the increase primarily attributable to our new locations opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. As a percentage of restaurant sales, cost of sales was 27.1% compared to 27.7% in the prior year, primarily reflecting improved kitchen efficiencies for both our comparable and non-comparable restaurants and favorable commodity pricing on chicken, pork and shrimp compared to 2014.\nLabor. Labor expense for our restaurants increased to $50.2 million, or 24.4%, from $40.3 million in 2014 primarily attributable to the nine new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. Labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to 35.1% compared to 33.9% in the prior year, reflecting labor inefficiencies from our newly opened locations, increased overtime hours associated with staffing shortages from a tight labor market and higher benefit costs. We expect labor cost as a percentage of sales to typically trend higher upon opening and gradually improve as our new restaurant management and employees become more efficient in operating their restaurants.\nOccupancy. Occupancy expenses increased $2.5 million or 30.6% to $10.5 million year over year, primarily associated with base rent and common area maintenance charges for new locations opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. Occupancy expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were 7.4% in 2015 compared to 6.8% in 2014.\nRestaurant Operating Expenses. Restaurant operating expenses increased $3.9 million, or 24.1%, to $20.3 million in 2015, primarily due to the additional operating expenses for the new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. Restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were 14.2% and 13.7% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year over year increase was driven by higher utilities, marketing expenses, professional services and training-related travel costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $12.6 million and $10.7 million, or 8.8% and 9.0% as a percentage of sales, in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars reflects human capital investment and additional travel costs to support our unit growth expansion and start-up efforts for our international business development, as well as higher stock-based compensation expense.\nPreopening Expense. Preopening expense was $4.7 million in 2015 compared to $2.5 million in 2014, including non-cash rent of $1.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Preopening expense in 2015 related to our San Juan restaurant opened in the first quarter of 2015, the Plano and Arlington restaurants opened in the second quarter of 2015, the Miami, Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Friendswood locations opened in the fourth quarter of 2015 and preparations for openings in the first half of 2016. Preopening expense in 2014 related to the Fort Worth restaurant opened in the first quarter of 2014, the El Paso location opened in the second quarter of 2014, the Alpharetta, Sarasota and Columbus restaurants opened in the fourth quarter of 2014 and expenses for restaurants scheduled to open in the first half of 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.7 million or 38.0% to $10.0 million year over year, primarily attributable to new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014, accelerated depreciation expense associated with the remodel of our Denver restaurant and disposal losses associated with the replacement of a portion of our smallwares and remodel activities. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales was 7.0% and 6.1% of restaurant sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOther Expenses. Other expenses of $0.2 million in 2015 primarily related to an expected settlement of a state use tax audit.\nInterest Expense, Net. Net interest expense is attributable to the amortization of deferred loan fees, the commitment fees associated with our credit facility and interest incurred on borrowings under the credit facility partially offset by interest income earned from cash and investment balances. We paid off all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility in June 2014. Interest expense also decreased due to lower deferred loan fee amortization year over year.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense in 2015 relates to state income tax expense for which no net operating loss carryforwards or other credits existed partially offset by refunds primarily associated with prior year federal income tax. We did not recognize any income tax expense in 2014 due to projected net operating loss carryforwards expected to be generated from tax planning strategies and available credits to offset taxable income.\nPotential Fluctuations in Quarterly Results and Seasonality\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the following:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> profitability of our restaurants, especially in new markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> preopening costs for our newly-opened restaurants and operating costs for those locations, which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> timing of restaurant remodels and potential lost sales associated with remodel closure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> labor availability and wages and benefits for hourly and management personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> increases and decreases in comparable restaurant sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> impairment of long-lived assets and any loss on restaurant closures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> fluctuations in commodity and food protein prices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> changes in borrowings and interest rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> general economic conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> weather conditions or natural disasters;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> timing of certain holidays;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> changes in government regulations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> settlements, damages and legal costs associated with litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> new or revised regulatory requirements and accounting pronouncements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the spring and summer months and winter holiday season. Consequently, our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of our investors. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely be impacted.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table presents unaudited consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2016. We believe that all necessary adjustments have been included to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with our annual financial statements and related notes. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter.\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Quarter Ended </td> <td>

are for new restaurant development and remodeling of existing restaurants. Similar to many restaurant companies, we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations. We believe that our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner. We are typically required to expend cash for leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment to construct and equip each restaurant. We also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants, including remodeling, to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures and for approved stock repurchase programs.\nThe following tables set forth, as of the dates and for the periods indicated, a summary of our key liquidity measurements (amounts in thousands):\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and short-term investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,233 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net working capital (deficit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,545 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,466 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,294 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,077 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuture Capital Requirements\nOur capital requirements, including development costs related to the opening of new restaurants, have historically been relatively significant. Over the past year, we funded development of new restaurants and remodels primarily from cash flows from operations, funds raised in our 2014 public offering of stock and borrowings under our credit facility. Our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including the operating performance of our current restaurants, the pace of expansion and remodels, real estate markets, site locations, the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords and capital market accessibility.\nWe plan to grow organically through unit expansion. We opened eight restaurants during 2016 for a unit growth rate of 22%. We spent $29.5 million in capital expenditures in 2016, net of tenant improvement allowances, for the planned construction and remodel of our restaurants. We are adjusting our projected growth rate for 2017 below our previously targeted growth rate of 20% and believe that a more moderate growth rate will provide us the flexibility to allocate our capital resources, to increase our earnings and to strengthen our balance sheet as well as to focus our time and attention on new restaurant operations and performance.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $10.5 million and outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of $26.8 million. We believe existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.7 million, the ability to draw additional borrowings under our recently amended $60 million credit facility, subject to compliance with certain covenants, and probable future amendments to our credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund property additions for new restaurants and planned remodels of existing restaurants during 2017.\nDuring 2016, we repurchased $11.2 million of common stock by completing our November 2015 $10.0 million stock repurchase program and repurchased and retired $1.4 million or 136,790 shares under the October 2016 $5.0 million stock repurchase program. We completed the October 2016 stock repurchase program in February 2017 with the purchase and retirement of 532,376 shares.\nAny reduction of our cash flow from operations or an inability to draw on our credit facility may cause a delay or cancellation of future restaurant development or remodels of existing restaurants. Financing to construct new restaurants or remodels for amounts in excess of our current cash and short-term investments and the line of credit availability may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could impact our growth plans, financial condition, and results of operations. Additional equity financing, to the extent available, may result in dilution to current stockholders and additional debt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations or financial covenants and ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business.\nDebt and Credit Agreements\nOn October 12, 2016, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) with KeyBank and Zions First National Bank to (i) increase the credit facility from $35 million to $60 million, comprised of a $45 million revolver ( Revolver\u201d) and a $15 million term loan ( Term Loan\u201d), and (ii) extend the maturity date of the credit facility to October 12, 2021. The credit facility is secured by our personal property and assets. Certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries have also guaranteed the credit facility.\nThe interest rate under the Second Amended Credit Agreement is KeyBank's prime rate or LIBOR, at our option, plus an applicable margin depending on our leverage ratio. The LIBOR margins range from 1.75% to 2.75% and the base rate margins range from 0.75% to 1.75%. Payments on the Term Loan are due quarterly and subject to acceleration upon certain events as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement, while borrowings on the Revolver are interest only, payable quarterly with respect to each base rate loan and at varying times with respect to LIBOR rate loans, with outstanding principal and interest due at maturity. Prepayment is permitted at any time without penalty, subject to certain restrictions on the order of repayment or prepayment. We are obligated to pay a commitment fee at an annual rate of 0.175% to 0.350%, depending on our leverage ratio, times the unused total revolving commitment of the credit facility based on the average daily amount outstanding under the credit facility for the previous quarter. The commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears.\nThe credit facility also requires us to comply with certain covenants, on a quarterly basis, including (a) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.50 and (b) a maximum leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.0 through the maturity date. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2016. We may from time to time request that the total revolving credit commitment under the Second Amended Credit Agreement be increased up to an amount not to exceed $85 million. Any such increase is subject to agreement of the respective lenders in the lending syndicate or new lenders in certain circumstances. Any such increase, which may be for a lesser amount than requested by us, is also subject to certain other terms and conditions as provided in the Second Amended Credit Agreement. Subsequent to Decmeber 31, 2016, we borrowed an additional $8 million on the Credit Facility to fund working capital and the share repurchase program. There is a high likelihood that we will not be in compliance with the leverage ratio requirement at March 31, 2017. As a result, we have engaged KeyBank, as lead bank, to enter into an amendment of the Credit Facility by March 31, 2017. We believe it is probable that an amendment will be executed and we will be in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2017. However, in the event that we do not enter into any amendment as expected by March 31, 2017, we will be in default of our covenants and the lenders have various remedies which would materially affect our financial condition. See Debt and Credit Agreements\u201d in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our debt and credit agreements.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash during the past three years:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,744 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,033 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38,215 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,858 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,811 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,579 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,523 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,697 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. We generated $20.9 million, $10.3 million and $14.7 million of operating cash flows in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in each comparative period was primarily due to the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses and the change in deferred rent as a result of recording tenant improvement allowances for new restaurants, offset by variation in our net income (loss).\nInvesting activities. We fund the development and construction of new restaurants and remodels primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and funds we raised in a 2014 public offering of our common stock. Capital expenditures in 2016 were $41.9 million, primarily associated with our eight new restaurant openings, costs for our Boca Park restaurant remodel, residual payments from restaurants opened during the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as construction, architecture and design costs associated with planned new restaurant openings and remodels for the first half of 2017 and maintenance capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2015 were $38.1 million, primarily associated with seven new restaurant openings, our Denver restaurant remodel, maintenance capital expenditures for existing locations as well as architecture, design and construction-related costs associated with new restaurants opened in the first half of 2016. Capital expenditures in 2014 were $21.9 million, driven by the additions of leasehold improvements, equipment and furniture and fixtures for five restaurants opened during 2014, maintenance capital expenditures for existing restaurants as well as expenditures for restaurants opened in early 2015.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2016 consisted of $29.5 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan and $0.7 million of net proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by $2.7 million in repayments on both the revolving credit facility and term loan, in addition to, $11.2 million in cash outflows for the repurchase of our common stock, $0.2 million for withholding tax payments from net settled option exercises and $0.5 million of debt issuance costs. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2015 consisted of $0.6 million of proceeds from stock option exercises partially offsetting a $0.2 million purchase and retirement of our common stock under the November 2015 authorization. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2014 consisted of $40.9 million of net proceeds from our public offering of 2.345 million shares of common stock and $0.6 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. The cash inflow was partially offset by a $3.5 million debt repayment on the KeyBank credit facility borrowings and $0.2 million in fees incurred for the KeyBank credit facility upsizing in November 2014.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands).\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less\nthan\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More\nthan\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The table above reflects obligations for all principal debt payments, but does not include interest payments on our variable-rate revolving credit facility and any commitment fees, primarily because the rates and balance outstanding can fluctuate.

We have evaluated and determined that we do not have any purchase obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet guarantees or off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation, and we select useful lives that reflect the estimated economic lives of the underlying assets. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the related lease term. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes. We capitalize improvements and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred. We are often required to exercise judgment in our decision whether to capitalize an asset or expense an expenditure that is for maintenance and repairs. The useful life of property and equipment and the determination as to what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgment by management, which may produce different amounts of repair and maintenance or depreciation expense if different assumptions were used.\nWe evaluate property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in restaurant operating results indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant negative industry or economic trends; and significant changes in laws and regulations, legal factors or in the business climate. The assessment of impairment is performed on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. This assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives, which are subject to a significant degree of judgment. If indicators of impairment are present and if we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the restaurant assets, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value. Calculation of fair value requires significant estimates and judgments which could vary significantly based on our assumptions.\nWe recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $12.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Such amounts are included in \"Asset impairment charge\" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. (See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the impairment charges.) We continue to monitor the operating performance of each individual restaurant. We may be required to record impairment charges in the future if certain restaurants perform below expectations.\nLeasing Activities\nWe lease all of our restaurant properties. At the inception of the lease, we evaluate each property and classify the lease as an operating or capital lease in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We exercise significant judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the restaurant as well as the discount rate used to discount the future minimum lease payments. The term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can reasonably be assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty. All of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases.\nOur lease term used for straight-line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date. There is potential for variability in our rent holiday\u201d period which typically begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date. Factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays or situations where we take possession of the leased premises upon execution of the lease. Extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater rent expensed during the rent holiday period.\nWe record contingent rent expense based on a percentage of restaurant sales amounts that exceed a specified sales threshold over the periods the liability is incurred. Contingent rent expense is recorded prior to achievement of specified sales levels if achievement of such amounts is considered probable and estimable.\nLeasehold improvements financed by the landlord through tenant improvement allowances are capitalized as leasehold improvements with the tenant improvement allowances recorded as deferred lease incentives. Deferred lease incentives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the asset or the lease term, including option periods which in the judgment of management are reasonably assured of renewal (same term that is used for related leasehold improvements) and are recorded as a reduction of occupancy expense. As part of the initial lease terms, we negotiate with our landlords to secure these tenant improvement allowances. There is no guarantee that we will receive tenant improvement allowances for any of our future locations, which would result in additional occupancy expenses.\nIn February 2016, ASC Topic 842, Leases, was issued to increase the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. In order to meet that objective, the new standard requires recognition of the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation. Both the ROU asset and lease liability will initially be measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Subsequent measurement, including the presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a finance or an operating lease. Initial costs directly attributable to negotiating and arranging the lease will be included in the ROU asset. Lessees can make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize a ROU asset and corresponding lease liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less. All of our restaurant leases are accounted for as operating leases, with no related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. Accordingly, changes in lease accounting rules or their interpretation, or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities. These estimates consider, among other items, effective rates for state and local income taxes, allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income, estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes, and the tax deductibility of certain other items. Our estimates are based on information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provision. Income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state, and local governments, generally years after the returns are filed. These returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of carryforwards and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The realization of tax benefits of deductible temporary differences and operating loss or tax credit carryforwards will depend on whether we have sufficient taxable income within the carryback and carryforward periods permitted by tax law to allow for utilization of the deductible amounts and carryforwards. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would likely result in an income tax benefit.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe apply the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of stock option awards, which requires the use of a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to the actual and projected employee and director stock option exercise behavior, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and expected term. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock. We utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option. We also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimate forfeitures based on our expectation of future experience while considering our historical experience. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). We are also required to establish deferred tax assets for expense relating to options that would be expected to generate a tax deduction under their original terms. The recoverability of such assets are dependent upon the actual deduction that may be available at exercise and can further be impaired by either the expiration of the option or an overall valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.\nWe believe the estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances; however, should future events result in unanticipated consequences, there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 Recently Issued Accounting

discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth under Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe currently own and operate 45 restaurants located in 23 states and Puerto Rico. Over the past three years, we have grown organically through opening new restaurants. We achieved a unit growth rate of 22% for 2016, with eight openings during the year and 23% unit growth in 2015 with seven restaurant openings. We plan to open three restaurants during 2017, which is below our previous targeted growth rate of 20%. We believe that a more modest growth rate will provide us the flexibility to allocate capital resources, increase our earnings and strengthen our balance sheet as well as to focus our time and attention on new restaurant operations and performance.\nWe continue to execute our strategy for international market expansion. Given the strength our concept has enjoyed thus far in the U.S. and the increased demand for upscale casual dining concepts overseas, we believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our concept in Latin America, the Middle East and beyond. In February 2016, we announced an agreement for the development of six Kona Grill restaurants in Mexico and in April 2016, we signed an agreement for the development of six Kona Grill restaurants in the United Arab Emirates. We expect each of our international franchise partners to open a Kona Grill restaurant in their respective country during 2017.\nWe continue to focus on growing sales and successfully opening new restaurants. Our same-store sales increased 0.5% year over year, with 2.4% growth in check average partially offsetting a 1.9% decrease in customer traffic. We have generated positive same-store sales in each of the past six years.\nOur restaurant operating profit, defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales, labor, occupancy, and restaurant operating expenses, increased to $23.7 million or 2.0% from $23.2 million in 2015. Restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales of 14.0% in 2016 included new restaurant operating inefficiencies for 12 locations that opened since October 2015. Restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales of 16.2% in 2015 included new restaurant operating inefficiencies for 10 locations opened since October 2014. See Key Measures\u201d and Financial Performance Overview\u201d below for further information on restaurant operating profit and Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation to income (loss) from operations.\nOur cost of sales, labor, and other operating expenses for our restaurants open at least 12 months generally trend consistently with restaurant sales, and we analyze those costs as a percentage of restaurant sales. Our typical new restaurants experience gradually increasing unit volumes as customers discover our concept and we generate market awareness. We anticipate that our new restaurants will take up to twelve months to achieve the majority of operating efficiencies as a result of challenges typically associated with opening and operating new restaurants, including lack of market recognition and the need to hire and sufficiently train employees, as well as other factors. We expect cost of sales and labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales to be higher when we open a new restaurant, but to decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as the restaurant matures and as the restaurant management and employees become more efficient in operating that unit. Occupancy and a portion of restaurant operating expenses are fixed. As a result, the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had, and is expected to continue to have, an impact on cost of sales, labor, occupancy, and restaurant operating expenses measured as a percentage of restaurant sales which we expect will continue until these restaurants mature.\nKey Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Company\nKey measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following:\nNumber of Restaurant Openings. Number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period.\nSame-Store Sales Percentage Change. Same-store sales percentage change reflects the periodic change in restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base. In calculating the percentage change in same-store sales, we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than 18 months. We adjust the sales included in the same-store sales calculation for restaurant closures, primarily as a result of remodels, so that the periods will be comparable. Same-store sales growth can be generated by an increase in customer traffic counts or by increases in the per person average check amount. Menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold can affect the per person average check amount.\nOperating Weeks. Operating weeks represent the number of weeks that our restaurants were open during the reporting period.\nSales per Square Foot. Sales per square foot is a measure of a restaurant's productivity and represents the amount of sales generated for each square foot.\nAverage Unit Volume. Average unit volume represents the average restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base.\nRestaurant Operating Profit. Restaurant operating profit is defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales, labor, occupancy, and restaurant operating expenses. Restaurant operating profit does not include general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, or preopening expenses. We believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency, and performance prior to application of corporate overhead. We use restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants' financial performance compared with our competitors. This measure provides useful information regarding our financial condition and results of operations and allows investors to better determine future financial results driven by growth and to compare restaurant level profitability.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus the sum of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus preopening expense, asset impairment charge, stock-based compensation, and unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because: (i) we believe it is a useful measure for investors to assess the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses and stock-based compensation as well as the costs of opening new restaurants; (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness; and (iii) we use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance and compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nKey Financial Definitions\nRestaurant Sales. Restaurant sales include gross food and beverage sales, net of promotions and discounts.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales consists of food and beverage costs and related delivery fees.\nLabor. Labor includes all direct and indirect labor costs incurred in operations.\nOccupancy. Occupancy includes all rent payments associated with the leasing of real estate, including base, percentage and straight-line rent, real estate taxes, and common area maintenance expense. We record tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense over the term of the lease.\nRestaurant Operating Expenses. Restaurant operating expenses consist of all other restaurant-level operating costs, the major components of which are utilities, credit card fees, advertising, supplies, marketing, repair and maintenance, and other expenses. Other operating expenses contain both variable and fixed components.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative includes all corporate and administrative functions that support operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth. Components of this category include management and staff salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and related employee benefits, travel, information systems, corporate rent, professional and consulting fees, and corporate insurance costs.\nPreopening Expense. Preopening expense consists of costs incurred prior to opening a new restaurant and is comprised principally of manager salaries, payroll and related training costs for new employees, including food and beverage costs associated with practice and rehearsal of service activities, and rent expense incurred from the date we obtain possession of the property until opening. We expense restaurant preopening expenses as incurred. We expect preopening expenses to commence six to eight months prior to a restaurant opening. Although the actual preopening expenses for a particular location depend upon numerous factors, our historical cash preopening expenses average approximately $450,000 per location, and non-cash preopening rent expense typically ranges from $50,000 to $100,000 per location. Our preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the number of restaurants opened, the timing of new restaurant openings, the location of the restaurants, and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense consists of the depreciation of property and equipment. Depreciation and amortization expense also includes gains or losses on the disposal of fixed assets, primarily associated with remodel activities.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense consists of the cost of servicing our debt obligations, the amortization of debt issuance costs and commitment fees on the line of credit. Interest expense is offset by interest earned on cash and investment balances. We capitalize interest incurred on borrowings for restaurant construction.\nIncome Tax Expense. Expense for income taxes represents amounts due for federal and state income taxes.\nFinancial Performance Overview\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our financial performance for 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nThe table below sets forth our reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and restaurant operating profit to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\n\n\nCertain percentage amounts may not sum to total due to rounding.\nStore Growth Activity\n\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the years indicated, our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) expressed as a percentage of restaurant sales.\n\nCertain percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRestaurant Sales. Restaurant sales increased 18.5% to $169.5 million during 2016 from $143.0 million in 2015, primarily due to a 24% increase in the number of operating weeks and same-store sales growth of 0.5% year over year. The increase is primarily due to restaurant sales generated by eight restaurants opened during 2016 and a full year of sales for seven restaurants that opened during 2015.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased $6.5 million, or 16.8% to $45.3 million in 2016 compared to $38.8 million in 2015, with the increase primarily attributable to our new locations opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. As a percentage of restaurant sales, cost of sales was 26.7% compared to 27.1% in the prior year, primarily reflecting improved kitchen efficiencies and favorable commodity pricing for poultry, produce and dairy products compared to 2015.\nLabor. Labor expense for our restaurants increased to $62.0 million from $50.2 million in 2015, an increase of 23.6%, primarily due to the twelve new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. Labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to 36.6% compared to 35.1% in the prior year, reflecting labor inefficiencies from our newly opened locations, increased wage costs due to certain state or local mandated minimum wage increases and a competitive labor market, and higher benefit costs. We expect labor cost as a percentage of sales to typically trend higher upon opening and gradually improve as our new restaurant management and employees become more efficient in operating their restaurants.\nOccupancy. Occupancy expenses increased $3.2 million or 30.6% to $13.8 million year over year, primarily associated with base rent and common area maintenance charges for twelve new locations opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. Occupancy expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were 8.1% in 2016 compared to 7.4% in 2015.\nRestaurant Operating Expenses. Restaurant operating expenses increased $4.4 million, or 21.9%, to $24.7 million in 2016, primarily due to the additional operating expenses for twelve new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. Restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were 14.6% and 14.2% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The year over year increase was driven in part by higher repair and maintenance costs, marketing expenses, professional services and training-related travel costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars by $0.7 million, or 5.2% to $13.3 million from $12.6 million year over year; however, these expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to 7.8% in 2016 compared to 8.8% in the prior year. Increased payroll, benefit costs and recruiting fees associated with additional headcount to support our unit growth expansion, higher audit fees and increased legal and professional fees contributed to the year over year increase in absolute dollars, partially offset by lower incentive compensation.\nPreopening Expense. Preopening expense was $4.5 million in 2016 compared to $4.7 million in 2015, including non-cash rent of $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Preopening expense in 2016 related to our Irvine, Fairfax, and Minnetonka restaurants opened in the second quarter of 2016, the Nashville, and Waikiki restaurants opened in the third quarter of 2016, and the Huntsville, Winter Park, and San Antonio locations opened in the fourth quarter of 2016, in addition to non-cash rent for two openings scheduled for the first half of 2017. Preopening expense in 2015 related to our San Juan restaurant opened in the first quarter of 2015, the Plano and Arlington restaurants opened in the second quarter of 2015, the Miami, Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Friendswood locations opened in the fourth quarter of 2015 and preparations for openings in the first half of 2016.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.4 million or 44.7% to $14.4 million year over year, primarily attributable to the incremental depreciation expense for eight restaurants opened during 2016 and a full year of depreciation expense for seven restaurants that opened during 2015 as well as depreciation expense associated with the Boca Park and Kansas City remodels. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales was 8.5% and 7.0% of restaurant sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAsset Impairment Charge. During 2016, we recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of $12.5 million related to the write-down of certain long-lived assets associated with five underperforming restaurants. The asset impairment charges were based upon an assessment of each restaurant's historical operating performance combined with expected cash flows for that restaurants over the respective remaining lease term. We have no plans to close any of these restaurants; however, we will continue to evaluate each of these restaurants to determine whether operating performance can be improved.\nOther Expenses. Other expenses of $0.2 million in 2015 primarily related to an expected settlement of a state use tax audit.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense increased to $0.6 million year-over-year due to borrowings under the credit facility. We used the majority of the borrowings to fund new restaurant construction and remodel activities in 2016. We did not borrow from the credit facility during 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense. We recorded income tax expense of $66,000 and $43,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income tax expense for 2016 and 2015 relate to state income tax expense for which no net operating loss carryforwards or other credits exist partially offset by refunds primarily associated with previous year state income tax. We did not recognize any federal income tax benefit in 2016 or 2015 due to projected net operating loss carryforwards expected to be generated from tax planning strategies and available credits to offset taxable income.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRestaurant Sales. Restaurant sales increased $23.9 million or 20.1% in 2015, primarily attributable to a 19.4% increase in the number of operating weeks. Our same-store sales increased 2.0% year over year, with a 2.6% growth in average check resulting from a 1.5% menu price increase in April 2015 and a shift in menu mix partially offset by a 0.6% decrease in customer traffic. The 2.0% same-store sales growth in 2015 compares to a 3.8% increase in same-store sales in 2014.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased $5.8 million, or 17.7% to $38.8 million in 2015 compared to $33.0 million in 2014, with the increase primarily attributable to our new locations opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. As a percentage of restaurant sales, cost of sales was 27.1% compared to 27.7% in the prior year, primarily reflecting improved kitchen efficiencies for both our comparable and non-comparable restaurants and favorable commodity pricing on chicken, pork and shrimp compared to 2014.\nLabor. Labor expense for our restaurants increased to $50.2 million, or 24.4%, from $40.3 million in 2014 primarily attributable to the nine new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. Labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to 35.1% compared to 33.9% in the prior year, reflecting labor inefficiencies from our newly opened locations, increased overtime hours associated with staffing shortages from a tight labor market and higher benefit costs. We expect labor cost as a percentage of sales to typically trend higher upon opening and gradually improve as our new restaurant management and employees become more efficient in operating their restaurants.\nOccupancy. Occupancy expenses increased $2.5 million or 30.6% to $10.5 million year over year, primarily associated with base rent and common area maintenance charges for new locations opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. Occupancy expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were 7.4% in 2015 compared to 6.8% in 2014.\nRestaurant Operating Expenses. Restaurant operating expenses increased $3.9 million, or 24.1%, to $20.3 million in 2015, primarily due to the additional operating expenses for the new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. Restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were 14.2% and 13.7% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year over year increase was driven by higher utilities, marketing expenses, professional services and training-related travel costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $12.6 million and $10.7 million, or 8.8% and 9.0% as a percentage of sales, in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars reflects human capital investment and additional travel costs to support our unit growth expansion and start-up efforts for our international business development, as well as higher stock-based compensation expense.\nPreopening Expense. Preopening expense was $4.7 million in 2015 compared to $2.5 million in 2014, including non-cash rent of $1.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Preopening expense in 2015 related to our San Juan restaurant opened in the first quarter of 2015, the Plano and Arlington restaurants opened in the second quarter of 2015, the Miami, Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Friendswood locations opened in the fourth quarter of 2015 and preparations for openings in the first half of 2016. Preopening expense in 2014 related to the Fort Worth restaurant opened in the first quarter of 2014, the El Paso location opened in the second quarter of 2014, the Alpharetta, Sarasota and Columbus restaurants opened in the fourth quarter of 2014 and expenses for restaurants scheduled to open in the first half of 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.7 million or 38.0% to $10.0 million year over year, primarily attributable to new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014, accelerated depreciation expense associated with the remodel of our Denver restaurant and disposal losses associated with the replacement of a portion of our smallwares and remodel activities. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales was 7.0% and 6.1% of restaurant sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOther Expenses. Other expenses of $0.2 million in 2015 primarily related to an expected settlement of a state use tax audit.\nInterest Expense, Net. Net interest expense is attributable to the amortization of deferred loan fees, the commitment fees associated with our credit facility and interest incurred on borrowings under the credit facility partially offset by interest income earned from cash and investment balances. We paid off all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility in June 2014. Interest expense also decreased due to lower deferred loan fee amortization year over year.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense in 2015 relates to state income tax expense for which no net operating loss carryforwards or other credits existed partially offset by refunds primarily associated with prior year federal income tax. We did not recognize any income tax expense in 2014 due to projected net operating loss carryforwards expected to be generated from tax planning strategies and available credits to offset taxable income.\nPotential Fluctuations in Quarterly Results and Seasonality\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the following:\n\n \u25cf preopening costs for our newly-opened restaurants and operating costs for those locations, which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter; \n \u25cf timing of restaurant remodels and potential lost sales associated with remodel closure; \n \u25cf labor availability and wages and benefits for hourly and management personnel; \n \u25cf increases and decreases in comparable restaurant sales; \n \u25cf impairment of long-lived assets and any loss on restaurant closures; \n \u25cf fluctuations in commodity and food protein prices; \n \u25cf changes in borrowings and interest rates; \n \u25cf general economic conditions; \n \u25cf weather conditions or natural disasters; \n \u25cf timing of certain holidays; \n \u25cf changes in government regulations; \n \u25cf settlements, damages and legal costs associated with litigation; \n \u25cf new or revised regulatory requirements and accounting pronouncements; and \n \u25cf changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions. \nOur business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the spring and summer months and winter holiday season. Consequently, our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of our investors. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely be impacted.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table presents unaudited consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2016. We believe that all necessary adjustments have been included to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with our annual financial statements and related notes. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCurrently, our primary ongoing capital requirements are for new restaurant development and remodeling of existing restaurants. Similar to many restaurant companies, we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations. We believe that our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner. We are typically required to expend cash for leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment to construct and equip each restaurant. We also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants, including remodeling, to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures and for approved stock repurchase programs.\nThe following tables set forth, as of the dates and for the periods indicated, a summary of our key liquidity measurements (amounts in thousands):\n\n\nFuture Capital Requirements\nOur capital requirements, including development costs related to the opening of new restaurants, have historically been relatively significant. Over the past year, we funded development of new restaurants and remodels primarily from cash flows from operations, funds raised in our 2014 public offering of stock and borrowings under our credit facility. Our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including the operating performance of our current restaurants, the pace of expansion and remodels, real estate markets, site locations, the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords and capital market accessibility.\nWe plan to grow organically through unit expansion. We opened eight restaurants during 2016 for a unit growth rate of 22%. We spent $29.5 million in capital expenditures in 2016, net of tenant improvement allowances, for the planned construction and remodel of our restaurants. We are adjusting our projected growth rate for 2017 below our previously targeted growth rate of 20% and believe that a more moderate growth rate will provide us the flexibility to allocate our capital resources, to increase our earnings and to strengthen our balance sheet as well as to focus our time and attention on new restaurant operations and performance.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $10.5 million and outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of $26.8 million. We believe existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.7 million, the ability to draw additional borrowings under our recently amended $60 million credit facility, subject to compliance with certain covenants, and probable future amendments to our credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund property additions for new restaurants and planned remodels of existing restaurants during 2017.\nDuring 2016, we repurchased $11.2 million of common stock by completing our November 2015 $10.0 million stock repurchase program and repurchased and retired $1.4 million or 136,790 shares under the October 2016 $5.0 million stock repurchase program. We completed the October 2016 stock repurchase program in February 2017 with the purchase and retirement of 532,376 shares.\nAny reduction of our cash flow from operations or an inability to draw on our credit facility may cause a delay or cancellation of future restaurant development or remodels of existing restaurants. Financing to construct new restaurants or remodels for amounts in excess of our current cash and short-term investments and the line of credit availability may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could impact our growth plans, financial condition, and results of operations. Additional equity financing, to the extent available, may result in dilution to current stockholders and additional debt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations or financial covenants and ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business.\nDebt and Credit Agreements\nOn October 12, 2016, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) with KeyBank and Zions First National Bank to (i) increase the credit facility from $35 million to $60 million, comprised of a $45 million revolver ( Revolver\u201d) and a $15 million term loan ( Term Loan\u201d), and (ii) extend the maturity date of the credit facility to October 12, 2021. The credit facility is secured by our personal property and assets. Certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries have also guaranteed the credit facility.\nThe interest rate under the Second Amended Credit Agreement is KeyBank's prime rate or LIBOR, at our option, plus an applicable margin depending on our leverage ratio. The LIBOR margins range from 1.75% to 2.75% and the base rate margins range from 0.75% to 1.75%. Payments on the Term Loan are due quarterly and subject to acceleration upon certain events as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement, while borrowings on the Revolver are interest only, payable quarterly with respect to each base rate loan and at varying times with respect to LIBOR rate loans, with outstanding principal and interest due at maturity. Prepayment is permitted at any time without penalty, subject to certain restrictions on the order of repayment or prepayment. We are obligated to pay a commitment fee at an annual rate of 0.175% to 0.350%, depending on our leverage ratio, times the unused total revolving commitment of the credit facility based on the average daily amount outstanding under the credit facility for the previous quarter. The commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears.\nThe credit facility also requires us to comply with certain covenants, on a quarterly basis, including (a) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.50 and (b) a maximum leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.0 through the maturity date. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2016. We may from time to time request that the total revolving credit commitment under the Second Amended Credit Agreement be increased up to an amount not to exceed $85 million. Any such increase is subject to agreement of the respective lenders in the lending syndicate or new lenders in certain circumstances. Any such increase, which may be for a lesser amount than requested by us, is also subject to certain other terms and conditions as provided in the Second Amended Credit Agreement. Subsequent to Decmeber 31, 2016, we borrowed an additional $8 million on the Credit Facility to fund working capital and the share repurchase program. There is a high likelihood that we will not be in compliance with the leverage ratio requirement at March 31, 2017. As a result, we have engaged KeyBank, as lead bank, to enter into an amendment of the Credit Facility by March 31, 2017. We believe it is probable that an amendment will be executed and we will be in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2017. However, in the event that we do not enter into any amendment as expected by March 31, 2017, we will be in default of our covenants and the lenders have various remedies which would materially affect our financial condition. See Debt and Credit Agreements\u201d in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our debt and credit agreements.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash during the past three years:\n\nOperating Activities. We generated $20.9 million, $10.3 million and $14.7 million of operating cash flows in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in each comparative period was primarily due to the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses and the change in deferred rent as a result of recording tenant improvement allowances for new restaurants, offset by variation in our net income (loss).\nInvesting activities. We fund the development and construction of new restaurants and remodels primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and funds we raised in a 2014 public offering of our common stock. Capital expenditures in 2016 were $41.9 million, primarily associated with our eight new restaurant openings, costs for our Boca Park restaurant remodel, residual payments from restaurants opened during the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as construction, architecture and design costs associated with planned new restaurant openings and remodels for the first half of 2017 and maintenance capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2015 were $38.1 million, primarily associated with seven new restaurant openings, our Denver restaurant remodel, maintenance capital expenditures for existing locations as well as architecture, design and construction-related costs associated with new restaurants opened in the first half of 2016. Capital expenditures in 2014 were $21.9 million, driven by the additions of leasehold improvements, equipment and furniture and fixtures for five restaurants opened during 2014, maintenance capital expenditures for existing restaurants as well as expenditures for restaurants opened in early 2015.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2016 consisted of $29.5 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan and $0.7 million of net proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by $2.7 million in repayments on both the revolving credit facility and term loan, in addition to, $11.2 million in cash outflows for the repurchase of our common stock, $0.2 million for withholding tax payments from net settled option exercises and $0.5 million of debt issuance costs. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2015 consisted of $0.6 million of proceeds from stock option exercises partially offsetting a $0.2 million purchase and retirement of our common stock under the November 2015 authorization. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2014 consisted of $40.9 million of net proceeds from our public offering of 2.345 million shares of common stock and $0.6 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. The cash inflow was partially offset by a $3.5 million debt repayment on the KeyBank credit facility borrowings and $0.2 million in fees incurred for the KeyBank credit facility upsizing in November 2014.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands).\n\n (1) The table above reflects obligations for all principal debt payments, but does not include interest payments on our variable-rate revolving credit facility and any commitment fees, primarily because the rates and balance outstanding can fluctuate. See Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on interest expense and commitment fees. \n (2) The table above reflects obligations for all leases signed for restaurants but does not include obligations related to lease renewal option periods even if it is reasonably assured that we will exercise the related option. We have evaluated and determined that we do not have any purchase obligations. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet guarantees or off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation, and we select useful lives that reflect the estimated economic lives of the underlying assets. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the related lease term. We calculate depreciation using the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth under Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe currently own and operate 45 restaurants located in 23 states and Puerto Rico. Over the past three years, we have grown organically through opening new restaurants. We achieved a unit growth rate of 22% for 2016, with eight openings during the year and 23% unit growth in 2015 with seven restaurant openings. We plan to open three restaurants during 2017, which is below our previous targeted growth rate of 20%. We believe that a more modest growth rate will provide us the flexibility to allocate capital resources, increase our earnings and strengthen our balance sheet as well as to focus our time and attention on new restaurant operations and performance.\nWe continue to execute our strategy for international market expansion. Given the strength our concept has enjoyed thus far in the U.S. and the increased demand for upscale casual dining concepts overseas, we believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our concept in Latin America, the Middle East and beyond. In February 2016, we announced an agreement for the development of six Kona Grill restaurants in Mexico and in April 2016, we signed an agreement for the development of six Kona Grill restaurants in the United Arab Emirates. We expect each of our international franchise partners to open a Kona Grill restaurant in their respective country during 2017.\nWe continue to focus on growing sales and successfully opening new restaurants. Our same-store sales increased 0.5% year over year, with 2.4% growth in check average partially offsetting a 1.9% decrease in customer traffic. We have generated positive same-store sales in each of the past six years.\nOur restaurant operating profit, defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales, labor, occupancy, and restaurant operating expenses, increased to $23.7 million or 2.0% from $23.2 million in 2015. Restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales of 14.0% in 2016 included new restaurant operating inefficiencies for 12 locations that opened since October 2015. Restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales of 16.2% in 2015 included new restaurant operating inefficiencies for 10 locations opened since October 2014. See Key Measures\u201d and Financial Performance Overview\u201d below for further information on restaurant operating profit and Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation to income (loss) from operations.\nOur cost of sales, labor, and other operating expenses for our restaurants open at least 12 months generally trend consistently with restaurant sales, and we analyze those costs as a percentage of restaurant sales. Our typical new restaurants experience gradually increasing unit volumes as customers discover our concept and we generate market awareness. We anticipate that our new restaurants will take up to twelve months to achieve the majority of operating efficiencies as a result of challenges typically associated with opening and operating new restaurants, including lack of market recognition and the need to hire and sufficiently train employees, as well as other factors. We expect cost of sales and labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales to be higher when we open a new restaurant, but to decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as the restaurant matures and as the restaurant management and employees become more efficient in operating that unit. Occupancy and a portion of restaurant operating expenses are fixed. As a result, the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had, and is expected to continue to have, an impact on cost of sales, labor, occupancy, and restaurant operating expenses measured as a percentage of restaurant sales which we expect will continue until these restaurants mature.\nKey Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Company\nKey measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following:\nNumber of Restaurant Openings. Number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period.\nSame-Store Sales Percentage Change. Same-store sales percentage change reflects the periodic change in restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base. In calculating the percentage change in same-store sales, we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than 18 months. We adjust the sales included in the same-store sales calculation for restaurant closures, primarily as a result of remodels, so that the periods will be comparable. Same-store sales growth can be generated by an increase in customer traffic counts or by increases in the per person average check amount. Menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold can affect the per person average check amount.\nOperating Weeks. Operating weeks represent the number of weeks that our restaurants were open during the reporting period.\nSales per Square Foot. Sales per square foot is a measure of a restaurant's productivity and represents the amount of sales generated for each square foot.\nAverage Unit Volume. Average unit volume represents the average restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base.\nRestaurant Operating Profit. Restaurant operating profit is defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales, labor, occupancy, and restaurant operating expenses. Restaurant operating profit does not include general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, or preopening expenses. We believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency, and performance prior to application of corporate overhead. We use restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants' financial performance compared with our competitors. This measure provides useful information regarding our financial condition and results of operations and allows investors to better determine future financial results driven by growth and to compare restaurant level profitability.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus the sum of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus preopening expense, asset impairment charge, stock-based compensation, and unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because: (i) we believe it is a useful measure for investors to assess the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses and stock-based compensation as well as the costs of opening new restaurants; (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness; and (iii) we use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance and compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nKey Financial Definitions\nRestaurant Sales. Restaurant sales include gross food and beverage sales, net of promotions and discounts.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales consists of food and beverage costs and related delivery fees.\nLabor. Labor includes all direct and indirect labor costs incurred in operations.\nOccupancy. Occupancy includes all rent payments associated with the leasing of real estate, including base, percentage and straight-line rent, real estate taxes, and common area maintenance expense. We record tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense over the term of the lease.\nRestaurant Operating Expenses. Restaurant operating expenses consist of all other restaurant-level operating costs, the major components of which are utilities, credit card fees, advertising, supplies, marketing, repair and maintenance, and other expenses. Other operating expenses contain both variable and fixed components.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative includes all corporate and administrative functions that support operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth. Components of this category include management and staff salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and related employee benefits, travel, information systems, corporate rent, professional and consulting fees, and corporate insurance costs.\nPreopening Expense. Preopening expense consists of costs incurred prior to opening a new restaurant and is comprised principally of manager salaries, payroll and related training costs for new employees, including food and beverage costs associated with practice and rehearsal of service activities, and rent expense incurred from the date we obtain possession of the property until opening. We expense restaurant preopening expenses as incurred. We expect preopening expenses to commence six to eight months prior to a restaurant opening. Although the actual preopening expenses for a particular location depend upon numerous factors, our historical cash preopening expenses average approximately $450,000 per location, and non-cash preopening rent expense typically ranges from $50,000 to $100,000 per location. Our preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the number of restaurants opened, the timing of new restaurant openings, the location of the restaurants, and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense consists of the depreciation of property and equipment. Depreciation and amortization expense also includes gains or losses on the disposal of fixed assets, primarily associated with remodel activities.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense consists of the cost of servicing our debt obligations, the amortization of debt issuance costs and commitment fees on the line of credit. Interest expense is offset by interest earned on cash and investment balances. We capitalize interest incurred on borrowings for restaurant construction.\nIncome Tax Expense. Expense for income taxes represents amounts due for federal and state income taxes.\nFinancial Performance Overview\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our financial

Sales. Restaurant sales increased 18.5% to $169.5 million during 2016 from $143.0 million in 2015, primarily due to a 24% increase in the number of operating weeks and same-store sales growth of 0.5% year over year. The increase is primarily due to restaurant sales generated by eight restaurants opened during 2016 and a full year of sales for seven restaurants that opened during 2015.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased $6.5 million, or 16.8% to $45.3 million in 2016 compared to $38.8 million in 2015, with the increase primarily attributable to our new locations opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. As a percentage of restaurant sales, cost of sales was 26.7% compared to 27.1% in the prior year, primarily reflecting improved kitchen efficiencies and favorable commodity pricing for poultry, produce and dairy products compared to 2015.\nLabor. Labor expense for our restaurants increased to $62.0 million from $50.2 million in 2015, an increase of 23.6%, primarily due to the twelve new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. Labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to 36.6% compared to 35.1% in the prior year, reflecting labor inefficiencies from our newly opened locations, increased wage costs due to certain state or local mandated minimum wage increases and a competitive labor market, and higher benefit costs. We expect labor cost as a percentage of sales to typically trend higher upon opening and gradually improve as our new restaurant management and employees become more efficient in operating their restaurants.\nOccupancy. Occupancy expenses increased $3.2 million or 30.6% to $13.8 million year over year, primarily associated with base rent and common area maintenance charges for twelve new locations opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. Occupancy expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were 8.1% in 2016 compared to 7.4% in 2015.\nRestaurant Operating Expenses. Restaurant operating expenses increased $4.4 million, or 21.9%, to $24.7 million in 2016, primarily due to the additional operating expenses for twelve new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. Restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were 14.6% and 14.2% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The year over year increase was driven in part by higher repair and maintenance costs, marketing expenses, professional services and training-related travel costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars by $0.7 million, or 5.2% to $13.3 million from $12.6 million year over year; however, these expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to 7.8% in 2016 compared to 8.8% in the prior year. Increased payroll, benefit costs and recruiting fees associated with additional headcount to support our unit growth expansion, higher audit fees and increased legal and professional fees contributed to the year over year increase in absolute dollars, partially offset by lower incentive compensation.\nPreopening Expense. Preopening expense was $4.5 million in 2016 compared to $4.7 million in 2015, including non-cash rent of $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Preopening expense in 2016 related to our Irvine, Fairfax, and Minnetonka restaurants opened in the second quarter of 2016, the Nashville, and Waikiki restaurants opened in the third quarter of 2016, and the Huntsville, Winter Park, and San Antonio locations opened in the fourth quarter of 2016, in addition to non-cash rent for two openings scheduled for the first half of 2017. Preopening expense in 2015 related to our San Juan restaurant opened in the first quarter of 2015, the Plano and Arlington restaurants opened in the second quarter of 2015, the Miami, Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Friendswood locations opened in the fourth quarter of 2015 and preparations for openings in the first half of 2016.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.4 million or 44.7% to $14.4 million year over year, primarily attributable to the incremental depreciation expense for eight restaurants opened during 2016 and a full year of depreciation expense for seven restaurants that opened during 2015 as well as depreciation expense associated with the Boca Park and Kansas City remodels. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales was 8.5% and 7.0% of restaurant sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAsset Impairment Charge. During 2016, we recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of $12.5 million related to the write-down of certain long-lived assets associated with five underperforming restaurants. The asset impairment charges were based upon an assessment of each restaurant's historical operating performance combined with expected cash flows for that restaurants over the respective remaining lease term. We have no plans to close any of these restaurants; however, we will continue to evaluate each of these restaurants to determine whether operating performance can be improved.\nOther Expenses. Other expenses of $0.2 million in 2015 primarily related to an expected settlement of a state use tax audit.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense increased to $0.6 million year-over-year due to borrowings under the credit facility. We used the majority of the borrowings to fund new restaurant construction and remodel activities in 2016. We did not borrow from the credit facility during 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense. We recorded income tax expense of $66,000 and $43,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income tax expense for 2016 and 2015 relate to state income tax expense for which no net operating loss carryforwards or other credits exist partially offset by refunds primarily associated with previous year state income tax. We did not recognize any federal income tax benefit in 2016 or 2015 due to projected net operating loss carryforwards expected to be generated from tax planning strategies and available credits to offset taxable income.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRestaurant Sales. Restaurant sales increased $23.9 million or 20.1% in 2015, primarily attributable to a 19.4% increase in the number of operating weeks. Our same-store sales increased 2.0% year over year, with a 2.6% growth in average check resulting from a 1.5% menu price increase in April 2015 and a shift in menu mix partially offset by a 0.6% decrease in customer traffic. The 2.0% same-store sales growth in 2015 compares to a 3.8% increase in same-store sales in 2014.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased $5.8 million, or 17.7% to $38.8 million in 2015 compared to $33.0 million in 2014, with the increase primarily attributable to our new locations opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. As a percentage of restaurant sales, cost of sales was 27.1% compared to 27.7% in the prior year, primarily reflecting improved kitchen efficiencies for both our comparable and non-comparable restaurants and favorable commodity pricing on chicken, pork and shrimp compared to 2014.\nLabor. Labor expense for our restaurants increased to $50.2 million, or 24.4%, from $40.3 million in 2014 primarily attributable to the nine new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. Labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to 35.1% compared to 33.9% in the prior year, reflecting labor inefficiencies from our newly opened locations, increased overtime hours associated with staffing shortages from a tight labor market and higher benefit costs. We expect labor cost as a percentage of sales to typically trend higher upon opening and gradually improve as our new restaurant management and employees become more efficient in operating their restaurants.\nOccupancy. Occupancy expenses increased $2.5 million or 30.6% to $10.5 million year over year, primarily associated with base rent and common area maintenance charges for new locations opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. Occupancy expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were 7.4% in 2015 compared to 6.8% in 2014.\nRestaurant Operating Expenses. Restaurant operating expenses increased $3.9 million, or 24.1%, to $20.3 million in 2015, primarily due to the additional operating expenses for the new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. Restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were 14.2% and 13.7% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The year over year increase was driven by higher utilities, marketing expenses, professional services and training-related travel costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $12.6 million and $10.7 million, or 8.8% and 9.0% as a percentage of sales, in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars reflects human capital investment and additional travel costs to support our unit growth expansion and start-up efforts for our international business development, as well as higher stock-based compensation expense.\nPreopening Expense. Preopening expense was $4.7 million in 2015 compared to $2.5 million in 2014, including non-cash rent of $1.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Preopening expense in 2015 related to our San Juan restaurant opened in the first quarter of 2015, the Plano and Arlington restaurants opened in the second quarter of 2015, the Miami, Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Friendswood locations opened in the fourth quarter of 2015 and preparations for openings in the first half of 2016. Preopening expense in 2014 related to the Fort Worth restaurant opened in the first quarter of 2014, the El Paso location opened in the second quarter of 2014, the Alpharetta, Sarasota and Columbus restaurants opened in the fourth quarter of 2014 and expenses for restaurants scheduled to open in the first half of 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.7 million or 38.0% to $10.0 million year over year, primarily attributable to new restaurants opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014, accelerated depreciation expense associated with the remodel of our Denver restaurant and disposal losses associated with the replacement of a portion of our smallwares and remodel activities. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales was 7.0% and 6.1% of restaurant sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOther Expenses. Other expenses of $0.2 million in 2015 primarily related to an expected settlement of a state use tax audit.\nInterest Expense, Net. Net interest expense is attributable to the amortization of deferred loan fees, the commitment fees associated with our credit facility and interest incurred on borrowings under the credit facility partially offset by interest income earned from cash and investment balances. We paid off all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility in June 2014. Interest expense also decreased due to lower deferred loan fee amortization year over year.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense in 2015 relates to state income tax expense for which no net operating loss carryforwards or other credits existed partially offset by refunds primarily associated with prior year federal income tax. We did not recognize any income tax expense in 2014 due to projected net operating loss carryforwards expected to be generated from tax planning strategies and available credits to offset taxable income.\nPotential Fluctuations in Quarterly Results and Seasonality\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the following:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> profitability of our restaurants, especially in new markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u25cf preopening costs for our newly-opened restaurants and operating costs for those locations, which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter; \n \u25cf timing of restaurant remodels and potential lost sales associated with remodel closure; \n \u25cf labor availability and wages and benefits for hourly and management personnel; \n \u25cf increases and decreases in comparable restaurant sales; \n \u25cf impairment of long-lived assets and any loss on restaurant closures; \n \u25cf fluctuations in commodity and food protein prices; \n \u25cf changes in borrowings and interest rates; \n \u25cf general economic conditions; \n \u25cf weather conditions or natural disasters; \n \u25cf timing of certain holidays; \n \u25cf changes in government regulations; \n \u25cf settlements, damages and legal costs associated with litigation; \n \u25cf new or revised regulatory requirements and accounting pronouncements; and \n \u25cf changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions. \nOur business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the spring and summer months and winter holiday season. Consequently, our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of our investors. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely be impacted.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table presents unaudited consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2016. We believe that all necessary adjustments have been included to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with our annual financial statements and related notes. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter.\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Quarter Ended </td> <td>

are for new restaurant development and remodeling of existing restaurants. Similar to many restaurant companies, we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations. We believe that our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner. We are typically required to expend cash for leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment to construct and equip each restaurant. We also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants, including remodeling, to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures and for approved stock repurchase programs.\nThe following tables set forth, as of the dates and for the periods indicated, a summary of our key liquidity measurements (amounts in thousands):\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and short-term investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,233 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net working capital (deficit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,545 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,466 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,294 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,077 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuture Capital Requirements\nOur capital requirements, including development costs related to the opening of new restaurants, have historically been relatively significant. Over the past year, we funded development of new restaurants and remodels primarily from cash flows from operations, funds raised in our 2014 public offering of stock and borrowings under our credit facility. Our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including the operating performance of our current restaurants, the pace of expansion and remodels, real estate markets, site locations, the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords and capital market accessibility.\nWe plan to grow organically through unit expansion. We opened eight restaurants during 2016 for a unit growth rate of 22%. We spent $29.5 million in capital expenditures in 2016, net of tenant improvement allowances, for the planned construction and remodel of our restaurants. We are adjusting our projected growth rate for 2017 below our previously targeted growth rate of 20% and believe that a more moderate growth rate will provide us the flexibility to allocate our capital resources, to increase our earnings and to strengthen our balance sheet as well as to focus our time and attention on new restaurant operations and performance.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $10.5 million and outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of $26.8 million. We believe existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.7 million, the ability to draw additional borrowings under our recently amended $60 million credit facility, subject to compliance with certain covenants, and probable future amendments to our credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund property additions for new restaurants and planned remodels of existing restaurants during 2017.\nDuring 2016, we repurchased $11.2 million of common stock by completing our November 2015 $10.0 million stock repurchase program and repurchased and retired $1.4 million or 136,790 shares under the October 2016 $5.0 million stock repurchase program. We completed the October 2016 stock repurchase program in February 2017 with the purchase and retirement of 532,376 shares.\nAny reduction of our cash flow from operations or an inability to draw on our credit facility may cause a delay or cancellation of future restaurant development or remodels of existing restaurants. Financing to construct new restaurants or remodels for amounts in excess of our current cash and short-term investments and the line of credit availability may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could impact our growth plans, financial condition, and results of operations. Additional equity financing, to the extent available, may result in dilution to current stockholders and additional debt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations or financial covenants and ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business.\nDebt and Credit Agreements\nOn October 12, 2016, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) with KeyBank and Zions First National Bank to (i) increase the credit facility from $35 million to $60 million, comprised of a $45 million revolver ( Revolver\u201d) and a $15 million term loan ( Term Loan\u201d), and (ii) extend the maturity date of the credit facility to October 12, 2021. The credit facility is secured by our personal property and assets. Certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries have also guaranteed the credit facility.\nThe interest rate under the Second Amended Credit Agreement is KeyBank's prime rate or LIBOR, at our option, plus an applicable margin depending on our leverage ratio. The LIBOR margins range from 1.75% to 2.75% and the base rate margins range from 0.75% to 1.75%. Payments on the Term Loan are due quarterly and subject to acceleration upon certain events as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement, while borrowings on the Revolver are interest only, payable quarterly with respect to each base rate loan and at varying times with respect to LIBOR rate loans, with outstanding principal and interest due at maturity. Prepayment is permitted at any time without penalty, subject to certain restrictions on the order of repayment or prepayment. We are obligated to pay a commitment fee at an annual rate of 0.175% to 0.350%, depending on our leverage ratio, times the unused total revolving commitment of the credit facility based on the average daily amount outstanding under the credit facility for the previous quarter. The commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears.\nThe credit facility also requires us to comply with certain covenants, on a quarterly basis, including (a) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.50 and (b) a maximum leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.0 through the maturity date. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2016. We may from time to time request that the total revolving credit commitment under the Second Amended Credit Agreement be increased up to an amount not to exceed $85 million. Any such increase is subject to agreement of the respective lenders in the lending syndicate or new lenders in certain circumstances. Any such increase, which may be for a lesser amount than requested by us, is also subject to certain other terms and conditions as provided in the Second Amended Credit Agreement. Subsequent to Decmeber 31, 2016, we borrowed an additional $8 million on the Credit Facility to fund working capital and the share repurchase program. There is a high likelihood that we will not be in compliance with the leverage ratio requirement at March 31, 2017. As a result, we have engaged KeyBank, as lead bank, to enter into an amendment of the Credit Facility by March 31, 2017. We believe it is probable that an amendment will be executed and we will be in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2017. However, in the event that we do not enter into any amendment as expected by March 31, 2017, we will be in default of our covenants and the lenders have various remedies which would materially affect our financial condition. See Debt and Credit Agreements\u201d in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our debt and credit agreements.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash during the past three years:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,744 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,033 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38,215 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,858 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,811 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,579 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,523 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,697 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. We generated $20.9 million, $10.3 million and $14.7 million of operating cash flows in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in each comparative period was primarily due to the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses and the change in deferred rent as a result of recording tenant improvement allowances for new restaurants, offset by variation in our net income (loss).\nInvesting activities. We fund the development and construction of new restaurants and remodels primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and funds we raised in a 2014 public offering of our common stock. Capital expenditures in 2016 were $41.9 million, primarily associated with our eight new restaurant openings, costs for our Boca Park restaurant remodel, residual payments from restaurants opened during the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as construction, architecture and design costs associated with planned new restaurant openings and remodels for the first half of 2017 and maintenance capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2015 were $38.1 million, primarily associated with seven new restaurant openings, our Denver restaurant remodel, maintenance capital expenditures for existing locations as well as architecture, design and construction-related costs associated with new restaurants opened in the first half of 2016. Capital expenditures in 2014 were $21.9 million, driven by the additions of leasehold improvements, equipment and furniture and fixtures for five restaurants opened during 2014, maintenance capital expenditures for existing restaurants as well as expenditures for restaurants opened in early 2015.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2016 consisted of $29.5 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan and $0.7 million of net proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by $2.7 million in repayments on both the revolving credit facility and term loan, in addition to, $11.2 million in cash outflows for the repurchase of our common stock, $0.2 million for withholding tax payments from net settled option exercises and $0.5 million of debt issuance costs. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2015 consisted of $0.6 million of proceeds from stock option exercises partially offsetting a $0.2 million purchase and retirement of our common stock under the November 2015 authorization. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2014 consisted of $40.9 million of net proceeds from our public offering of 2.345 million shares of common stock and $0.6 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. The cash inflow was partially offset by a $3.5 million debt repayment on the KeyBank credit facility borrowings and $0.2 million in fees incurred for the KeyBank credit facility upsizing in November 2014.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands).\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less\nthan\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More\nthan\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The table above reflects obligations for all principal debt payments, but does not include interest payments on our variable-rate revolving credit facility and any commitment fees, primarily because the rates and balance outstanding can fluctuate. See Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on interest expense and commitment fees. \n (2) The table above reflects obligations for all leases signed for restaurants but does not include obligations related to lease renewal option periods even if it is reasonably assured that we will exercise the related option. We have evaluated and determined that we do not have any purchase obligations. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet guarantees or off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation, and we select useful lives that reflect the estimated economic lives of the underlying assets. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the related lease term. We calculate depreciation using the"}
