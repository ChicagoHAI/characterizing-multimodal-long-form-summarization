Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following should be read in conjunction with \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating Results\nFactors Affecting Operating Results\nBunge Limited, a Bermuda company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global agribusiness and food company with integrated operations that stretch from farmer to consumer. The commodity nature of the Company's principal products, as well as regional and global supply and demand variations that occur as an inherent part of the business, make volumes an important operating measure. Accordingly, information is included in \"Segment Results\" that summarizes certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment. The common unit of measure for all reported volumes is metric tons. A description of reported volumes for each reportable segment has also been included in the discussion of key factors affecting results of operations in each of our business segments as discussed below.\nAgribusiness\nIn the Agribusiness segment, we purchase, store, transport, process and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products. Profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy, transportation, and logistics services. Profitability in our processing operations is also impacted by volumes procured, processed and sold and by capacity utilization rates. Availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors, including weather, farmer planting and selling decisions, plant diseases, governmental policies, and agricultural sector economic conditions. Reported volumes in this segment primarily reflect (i) grains and oilseeds originated from farmers, cooperatives or other aggregators and from which \"origination margins\" are earned; (ii) oilseeds processed in our oilseed processing facilities and from which \"crushing margins\" are earned, representing the margin from the industrial separation of the oilseed into its protein meal and vegetable oil components, both of which are separate commodity products; and (iii) third party sales of grains, oilseeds and related commodity products merchandised through our distribution businesses and from which \"distribution margins\" are earned. The foregoing subsegment volumes may overlap as they produce separate margin capture opportunities. For example, oilseeds procured in our South American grain origination activities may be processed in our oilseed processing facilities in Asia-Pacific and will be reflected at both points within the segment. As such, these reported volumes do not represent solely volumes of net sales to third-parties, but rather where margin is earned, appropriately reflecting their contribution to our global network's capacity utilization and profitability.\nDemand for our purchased and processed Agribusiness products is affected by many factors, including global and regional economic conditions, changes in per capita income, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, particularly pork and poultry, population growth rates, relative prices of substitute agricultural products, outbreaks of disease associated with livestock and poultry, and demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products.\nWe expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global supply and demand for our Agribusiness products for the foreseeable future. We also expect that, from time to time, imbalances will likely exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions, which impacts our decisions regarding whether, when and where to purchase, store, transport, process or sell these commodities, including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity.\nAdditionally, price fluctuations and availability of commodities may cause fluctuations in our working capital, such as inventories, accounts receivable and borrowings over the course of a given year. For example, increased availability of commodities at harvest times often causes fluctuations in our inventories and borrowings. Increases in agricultural commodity prices will also generally cause our cash flow requirements to increase as our operations require increased use of cash to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange-traded futures that we use to hedge our physical inventories.\nRefined and Specialty Oils\nIn the Refined and Specialty Oils segment, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials such as crude vegetable oils, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita income, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets. Raw material inputs to our production processes in the Refined and Specialty Oils segment are largely sourced at market prices from our Agribusiness segment. Reported volumes in this segment reflect third-party sales of our finished products and, as such, include the sales of products\nderived from raw materials sourced from the Agribusiness segment as well as from third-parties. The unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials, which are their primary inputs.\nMilling\nIn the Milling segment, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials such as grains, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita income, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets. Raw material inputs to our production processes in the Milling segment are largely sourced at market prices from our Agribusiness segment. Reported volumes in these segments reflect third-party sales of our finished products and, as such, include the sales of products derived from raw materials sourced from the Agribusiness segment as well as from third-parties. The unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials, which are their primary inputs.\nSugar and Bioenergy\nOur Sugar and Bioenergy segment primarily comprises our 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, the joint venture formed in December 2019 by the combination of our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations with the Brazilian biofuels business of BP. Until December 2019, our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations formed the majority of our Sugar and Bioenergy segment through which we produced and sold sugar and ethanol derived from sugarcane, as well as energy derived from the sugar and ethanol production process. BP Bunge Bioenergia operates on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North and Midwest regions of Brazil. Following the joint venture's formation we no longer consolidate our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations in our consolidated financial statements and instead account for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our reported Sugar and Bioenergy results for 2021 and 2020 include our share of the net earnings in BP Bunge Bioenergia, whereas our Sugar and Bioenergy results for 2019 reflect our former 100% ownership interest in the Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations contributed to the joint venture. Although we are committed to supporting the growth and development of BP Bunge Bioenergia, our long-term goal is to seek strategic opportunities for our investment in the joint venture.\nProfitability in this segment is affected by the profitability of the joint venture and, therefore the value of our investment and the amount and timing of distributions we receive, if any. In turn, the profitability of the joint venture is affected by the availability and quality of sugarcane, which impacts capacity utilization rates and the amount of sugar that can be extracted from the sugarcane, and by market prices of sugar and ethanol. The availability and quality of sugarcane is affected by many factors, including weather, geographical factors such as soil quality and topography, and agricultural practices. Once planted, sugarcane may be harvested for several continuous years, but the yield decreases with each subsequent harvest. As a result, the current optimum economic cycle is generally five to seven consecutive harvests, depending on location. The joint venture owns and/or has partnership agreements to manage farmland on which it grows and harvests sugarcane and also purchases sugarcane from third parties. Prices of sugarcane in Brazil are established by Consecana, the state of S\u00e3o Paulo sugarcane, sugar and ethanol council, and are based on the sucrose content of the cane and the market prices of sugar and ethanol. Demand for the joint venture's products is affected by such factors as changes in global or regional economic conditions, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, population growth rates, changes in per capita income and demand for and governmental support of renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities, including sugarcane.\nIn addition to these industry related factors which impact our business areas, our results of operations in all business areas and segments are affected by the following factors:\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nDue to the global nature of our operations, our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. Both translation of our foreign subsidiaries' financial statements and foreign currency transactions can affect our results. On a monthly basis, for subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar, subsidiary statements of income and cash flows must be translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted-average exchange rates in each monthly period. As a result, fluctuations of local currencies compared to the U.S. dollar during each monthly period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each reported period (per quarter and year-to-date) and also affect comparisons between those reported periods. Subsidiary balance sheets are translated using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nAdditionally, we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity. These amounts are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates as\nof the balance sheet date, with the resulting gains or losses included in the entity's statement of income and, therefore, in our consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net.\nWe primarily use a combination of equity and intercompany loans to finance our subsidiaries. Intercompany loans that are of a long-term investment nature with no intention of repayment in the foreseeable future are considered permanently invested and as such are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses on such permanently invested intercompany loans are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets. In contrast, foreign currency translation gains or losses on intercompany loans that are not of a permanent nature are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a Bermuda exempted company, we are not subject to income taxes in our jurisdiction of incorporation. However, our subsidiaries, which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions, are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from 0% to 35%. The jurisdictions that significantly impact our effective tax rate are Brazil, the United States, Argentina, Switzerland and Bermuda. Determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nTotal segment earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") is an operating performance measure used by Bunge's management to evaluate segment operating activities. Bunge also uses Core Segment EBIT, Non-core Segment EBIT and Total Segment EBIT to evaluate the operating performance of Bunge's Core reportable segments, Non-core reportable segments, and total reportable segments together with Corporate and Other. Core Segment EBIT is the aggregate of the EBIT of each of Bunge's Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments. Non-core Segment EBIT is the EBIT of Bunge's Sugar & Bioenergy segment. Total Segment EBIT is the aggregate of the EBIT of Bunge's Core and Non-core reportable segments, together with Corporate and Other. Bunge's management believes Core Segment EBIT, Non-core Segment EBIT and Total Segment EBIT are useful measures of operating profitability since the measures allow for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to financing methods or capital structure. In addition, EBIT is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in Bunge's industry. Total Segment EBIT is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Further, Total Segment EBIT excludes EBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests and is not a measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net income (loss) or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP. See the reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT below.\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities, adjusted is calculated by including the Net proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables with Cash provided by (used for) operating activities. Cash provided by (used for) operating activities, adjusted is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace Cash provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Our management believes presentation of this measure allows investors to view our cash generating performance using the same measure that management uses in evaluating financial and business performance and trends.\n2021 Overview\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Bunge - For the year ended December 31, 2021, Net income attributable to Bunge was $2,078 million, an increase of $933 million compared to a Net income attributable to Bunge of $1,145 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to higher Segment EBIT in our Core and Non-core segments, as further discussed in the Segment Overview and Results of Operations section below.\nEarnings Per Common Share - Diluted - For the year ended December 31, 2021, Net income attributable to Bunge common shareholders, diluted, was $13.64 per share, an increase of $5.93 per share, compared to $7.71 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEBIT - For the year ended December 31, 2021, Total Segment EBIT was $2,661 million, an increase of $1,028 million compared to EBIT of $1,633 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Total Segment EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to higher Segment EBIT in our Core and Non-core segments, as further discussed in the Segment Overview and Results of Operations section below, and which also provides a reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit - Income tax expense was $398 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to income tax expense of $248 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in income tax expense\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to higher pretax income, resulting from higher EBIT in our Core and Non-core segments, as noted above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - At December 31, 2021, working capital, which equals total current assets less total current liabilities, was $7,136 million, an increase of $1,940 million, compared to working capital of $5,196 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in working capital is primarily due to higher commodity prices, including related increases in readily marketable inventories (\"RMI\") purchases, and lower short-term debt levels driven by a $1 billion long-term bond issuance in the second quarter of 2021 (see Note 18- Long-term Debt, to our consolidated financial statements), from which a portion of the proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt.\nSegment Overview and Results of Operations\nEffective January 1, 2021, we changed our reporting segments to align with our new value chain operational structure, as discussed in Note 28- Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements. Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts within the reporting segments have been made to conform to current presentation.\nOur operations are now organized, managed and classified into four reportable segments, organized based upon their similar economic characteristics, nature of products and services offered, production processes, types and classes of customer, and distribution methods. We further organize these reportable segments into Core operations and Non-core operations. Core operations comprise our Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments. Non-core operations comprise our Sugar & Bioenergy segment, which itself primarily comprises our 50% interest in the net earnings of BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture with BP p.l.c. (\"BP\").\nOur remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Corporate and Other. Corporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to our individual reporting segments because the operating performance of each reporting segment is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance program, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities.\nA reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT follows:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,280) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>(48) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests' share of interest and tax </td> <td> </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(891) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agribusiness Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>2,290 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>737 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Refined and Specialty Oils Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Milling Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>(74) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>2,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>954 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>(333) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(371) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(248) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sugar and Bioenergy Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,597) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-core Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,597) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(891) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCore Segments\nAgribusiness Segment\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes (in thousand metric tons) </td> <td> </td> <td>142,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139,158 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,920 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,133) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,185) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,765) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>2,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,155 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(432) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(520) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(490) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange (losses) gains -

The increase was due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, Net sales increased $7,125 million primarily due to significantly higher average sales prices in our soybean processing businesses in all regions, driven by higher commodity prices, and significantly higher average sales prices in our European softseed processing business. The above increases were partially offset by slightly lower volumes in most key regions.\n\u2022In Merchandising, Net sales increased $6,464 million due to significantly higher average sales prices, primarily in our global corn, global oil and global wheat businesses, driven by higher commodity prices, and higher sales in our ocean freight business driven by increased global freight demand and related sales prices.\nCost of goods sold increased by $12,948 million, or 46%, to $41,133 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $28,185 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, Cost of goods sold increased by $6,492 million due to higher global commodity prices and related sales as noted above, as well as increased industrial input costs driven by inflation, in particular energy, partially offset by favorable mark-to-market results in our global soybean processing businesses.\n\u2022In Merchandising, Cost of goods sold increased by $6,456 million due to higher global commodity prices and related sales as noted above, as well as increased industrial input costs driven by inflation, in particular energy, and unfavorable mark-to-market results, primarily in our ocean freight business.\nGross profit increased by $641 million, or 34%, to $2,503 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,862 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, an increase of $633 million was due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, as a result of strong oil and meal demand leading to higher sales prices, coupled with favorable mark-to-market results, as described above.\n\u2022In Merchandising, an increase of $8 million was due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, as higher average sales prices were partially offset by unfavorable mark-to-market results, as described above.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses decreased $88 million, or 17%, to $432 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $520 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a higher portion of variable incentive costs being allocated to Corporate and Other activities in the current year, as well as favorable currency movements, primarily from the weakening of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real.\nForeign exchange gains (losses) - net decreased $174 million, to a loss of $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a gain of $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Foreign exchange results were primarily driven by losses on U.S. dollar denominated loans payable in non-U.S. functional currency operations.\nOther income (expenses) - net increased $173 million, to income of $215 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to income of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to a $158 million gain resulting from the sale of certain interior grain elevators located in the United States during 2021.\nSegment EBIT increased $730 million, or 47%, to $2,290 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,560 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, an increase of $558 million was primarily due to higher Gross profit, lower SG&A and higher Other income (expense) - net, partially offset by foreign exchange losses, as described above.\n\u2022In Merchandising, an increase of $172 million was primarily due to higher Gross profit, lower SG&A and higher Other income (expense) - net, partially offset by foreign exchange losses, as described above.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nAgribusiness segment Net sales increased by $1,127 million, or 4%, to $30,047 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $28,920 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, Net sales increased $638 million principally due to higher sales volumes in our South American, North American, and European and Asian soybean processing businesses, primarily driven by increased meal demand in China and increased oil demand in North America, as well as higher volumes and prices in our Canadian and European softseed processing businesses, driven by demand for renewable diesel.\n\u2022In Merchandising, Net sales increased $489 million primarily due to higher average sales prices and volumes in our global corn and global oil businesses, driven by increased demand in China following an easing of trade restrictions in place for much of 2019, as well as higher volumes in Brazil driven by increased farmer selling in response to depreciation of Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar earlier in the year. The above increases were partially offset by lower volumes in our global wheat business.\nCost of goods sold increased by $420 million, or 2%, to $28,185 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $27,765 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, Cost of goods sold increased by $195 million due to higher sales activity, as described above, as well as unfavorable mark-to-market results in our processing businesses, partially offset by favorable translation impacts on industrial costs as most currencies in which such expenses are denominated depreciated versus the U.S. dollar during 2020, as well as non-recurring prior year property, plant and equipment (PP&E) impairment charges at various facilities associated with portfolio rationalization initiatives.\n\u2022In Merchandising, Cost of goods sold increased by $225 million due to the higher sales activity noted above, partially offset by favorable mark-to-market results and translation impacts on industrial costs as most currencies in which such expenses are denominated depreciated versus the U.S. dollar during 2020, as well as non-recurring prior year PP&E impairment charges at various facilities associated with portfolio rationalization initiatives.\nGross profit increased by $707 million, or 61%, to $1,862 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,155 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, an increase of $443 million was due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, primarily driven by strong demand in our soybean processing businesses across all regions, as described above.\n\u2022In Merchandising, an increase of $264 million was due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, primarily driven by strong demand in our global corn and global oil businesses, as described above.\nSG&A expenses increased $30 million, or 6%, to $520 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $490 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly due to higher variable incentive costs on the back of improved overall company profitability, partially offset by savings associated with ongoing cost initiatives, lower expenses due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, favorable translation impacts as most currencies in which SG&A expenses are\ndenominated depreciated versus the U.S. dollar during 2020, and an $11 million prior year write-off of an indemnification asset associated with the reversal of an uncertain tax position.\nForeign exchange gains (losses) - net increased $186 million, to a gain of $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss of $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Foreign exchange results were primarily driven by gains on U.S. dollar denominated loans receivable in non-U.S. functional currency operations.\nOther income (expenses) - net decreased $23 million, to income of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to income of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower results from our financial services activities during 2020.\nSegment EBIT increased $823 million, or 112%, to $1,560 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $737 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, an increase of $543 million was primarily due to higher Gross profit and increased foreign exchange results, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses, as described above.\n\u2022In Merchandising, an increase of $280 million was primarily due to higher Gross profit and increased foreign exchange results, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses, as described above.\nRefined and Specialty Oils Segment\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes (in thousand metric tons) </td> <td> </td> <td>9,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,632 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,193 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,476) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,859) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,582) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>611 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(355) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(391) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(375) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange losses - net </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests </td> <td> </td> <td>(73) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense) - net </td> <td> </td> <td>239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(121) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Refined and Specialty Oils Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2021 Compared to 2020\nRefined and Specialty Oils segment Net sales increased by $3,733 million, or 39%, to $13,332 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $9,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to significantly higher average selling prices in North America, Europe and Asia, driven by strong demand for renewable diesel and in food services. The above increases were partially offset by lower overall volumes, driven by our South American operations due to stay-at-home orders associated with COVID-19 earlier in the current year, as well as the sale of our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise assets in late 2020.\nCost of goods sold increased by $3,617 million, or 41%, to $12,476 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $8,859 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Cost of goods sold was due to higher raw material commodity prices as discussed above, higher industrial input costs, in particular energy, and a $50 million impairment charge, which includes $15 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, recorded in relation to an oils facility in China. These increases were partially offset by lower overall volumes as described in Net sales above.\nGross profit increased by $116 million, or 16%, to $856 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $740 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to the increase in Net sales in excess of the increase in Cost of goods sold, primarily driven by strong demand for renewable diesel and in food services, as described above.\nSG&A expenses decreased $36 million, or 9%, to $355 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $391 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher bad debt expense recorded in the prior year,\nfavorable currency movements, primarily from the weakening of the Brazilian real, and the allocation of a higher portion of variable incentive costs to Corporate and Other activities in the current year.\nEBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests, an expense when subsidiaries with noncontrolling interests generate earnings before interest and tax, versus income when subsidiaries with noncontrolling interests generate loss before interest and tax, decreased by $71 million, to expense of $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to expense of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The expense for the current year is primarily due to improved results in Bunge Loders Croklaan, including the noncontrolling interest share of the gain on sale of our Rotterdam oils refinery, partially offset by the noncontrolling interest share of an impairment charge on an oils facility in China.\nOther income (expenses) - net increased $144 million to income of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to income of $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Current period income was primarily due to a $219 million gain, which includes the amount attributable to noncontrolling interests, resulting on the sale of our Rotterdam oils refinery, as well as a $19 million gain on the sale of a Mexican oils packaging facility. Prior period income was due to a gain on the sale of our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise assets, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nSegment EBIT increased by $226 million, or 51%, to $666 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $440 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher Gross profit and Other income (expenses) - net, and lower SG&A, partially offset by higher EBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests, as described above.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nRefined and Specialty Oils segment Net sales increased by $406 million, or 4%, to $9,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $9,193 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to higher average selling prices in all regions, and higher sales volumes to food processor customers driven by increased at-home consumption associated with COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, partially offset by lower food services volumes, again due to COVID-19. The year ended December 31, 2020 also benefited from $47 million of indirect tax credits related to the favorable resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax claim.\nCost of goods sold increased by $277 million, or 3%, to $8,859 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $8,582 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in Cost of goods sold was due to higher Net sales, partially offset by favorable translation impacts, unfavorable mark-to-market results in 2019, and approximately $40 million of non-recurring PP&E impairment charges at various facilities associated with portfolio rationalization initiatives during 2019.\nGross profit increased by $129 million, or 21%, to $740 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $611 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, primarily related to food processor margin expansion resulting from increased at-home consumption associated with COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, as described above.\nSG&A expenses increased $16 million, or 4%, to $391 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $375 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher variable incentive costs on the back of improved overall company profitability and increased bad debt expense, partially offset by favorable translation impacts and lower travel costs associated with COVID-19 travel restrictions.\nOther income (expenses) - net increased $216 million, or 179%, to income of $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to expense of $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to a gain on the sale of our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise assets, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2020, and a 2019 goodwill impairment charge of $108 million, which includes $32 million attributable to noncontrolling interests associated with our Bunge Loders Croklaan joint venture.\nSegment EBIT increased by $319 million, or 264%, to $440 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The increase was primarily due to higher volumes and average sales prices in our South American and Mexican wheat milling businesses and higher average sales prices in our North American corn milling business, partially offset by lower volumes in North America due to the sale of our rice milling business in the prior year.\nCost of goods sold increased by $455 million, or 32%, to $1,882 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,427 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the increased sales activity noted above, higher industrial costs, in particular energy, and a non-recurring impairment charge of $170 million related to the classification of our Mexican wheat milling business as held-for-sale, as described further in Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes in North America resulting from the prior year sale of our rice business and favorable current year mark-to-market results.\nGross profit decreased by $162 million, or 86%, to $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $189 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in Cost of goods sold in excess of the increase in Net sales, mostly due to a non-recurring impairment charge of $170 million related to the classification of our Mexican wheat milling business as held-for-sale, as described above.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $4 million, or 4%, to $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The improved result is primarily due to our corporate venture capital unit (Bunge Ventures) activities, which benefited from a net mark-to-market gain on the initial public offering of two of its investments during the current year period, as well as a bad debt expense and related legal provision in relation to an historical account receivable balance deemed uncollectible in the prior year period, partially offset by higher variable incentive costs in the current year due in part to allocating a larger portion of variable incentive costs from the segments to Corporate and Other activities in the current year.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nCorporate and Other EBIT decreased $123 million, or 50%, to a loss of $371 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss of $248 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to higher variable incentive costs associated with improved company profitability during 2020, $66 million in bad debt expense in relation to a disputed account receivable balance stemming from an historical account receivable balance deemed uncollectible, and positive mark-to-market results on one of our corporate venture capital unit investments in 2019, partially offset by non-recurring impairment charges and related employee severance costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters in 2019, and lower travel costs in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions.\nNon-core Segment\nSugar and Bioenergy Segment\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes (in thousand metric tons) </td> <td> </td> <td>375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,836 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>(264) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(139) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,692) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,404) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange losses - net </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(89) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense) - net </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from affiliates </td> <td> </td> <td>106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Sugar and Bioenergy Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,597) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2021 Compared to 2020\nSegment EBIT increased $199 million, or 229%, to income of $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from a loss of $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is due to more favorable results from our investment in BP Bunge Bioenergia, driven by higher sugar and ethanol volumes and higher average sugar and ethanol sales prices in the current period, as well as a significant prior year foreign exchange loss on U.S. dollar denominated debt of the joint venture due to a large depreciation in the Brazilian real during 2020.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nSegment EBIT increased by $1,510 million, or 95% to a loss of $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss of $1,597 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Acquisitions and long-lived assets are generally financed with a combination of equity and long-term debt.\nWorking Capital\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>US$ in millions, except current ratio </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade accounts receivable, net </td> <td>2,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,717 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories </td> <td>8,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,172 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current assets(1)\n</td> <td>5,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,940 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,181 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,828 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term debt </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade accounts payable </td> <td>4,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,636 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current operating lease obligations </td> <td>350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>235 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current liabilities(2)\n</td> <td>3,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,278 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current liabilities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,985 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital(3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,196 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current ratio(3)\n</td> <td>1.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Comprises Assets held for sale and Other current assets\n(2)Comprises Liabilities held for sale and Other current liabilities\n(3)Working capital is defined as Total current assets less Total current liabilities; Current ratio represents Total current assets divided by Total current liabilities\nWorking capital was $7,136 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $1,940 million, or 37%, from working capital of $5,196 million at December 31, 2020.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents were $902 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $550 million from $352 million at December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of improved operating results. Cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy, the objectives of which are to preserve the principal value of our cash assets, maintain a high degree of liquidity and deliver competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions. Cash balances are invested in short-term deposits with highly rated financial institutions and in U.S. government securities.\nTrade accounts receivable, net - Trade accounts receivable, net were $2,112 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $395 million from $1,717 million at December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to increased Net sales in the current year driven by factors described in the Segment Overview & Results of Operations section above.\nInventories - Inventories were $8,431 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $1,259 million from $7,172 million at December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily related to higher average commodity prices at the end of the current year relative to the prior year.\nRMI comprises agricultural commodity inventories, including soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, and wheat that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms. Total RMI reported at fair value were $6,869 million and $5,961 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively (see Note 5- Inventories, to our consolidated financial statements).\nOther current assets - Other current assets, including Assets held for sale, were $5,015 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1,925 million from $6,940 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to decreased unrealized gains on derivative contracts, lower margin deposits, and completion of the sale of our Rotterdam oils facility and United States\ninterior grain assets during the year ended December 31, 2021, which were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2020. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Deferred purchase price receivable (see Note 4- Trade Accounts Receivable and Trade Receivable Securitization Program, to our consolidated financial statements) as well as the reclassification of certain assets associated with our Mexico wheat milling business as held for sale during the current year (see Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions, to our consolidated financial statements).\nShort-term debt - Short-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, was $1,177 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1,659 million from $2,836 million at December 31, 2020. The lower short-term debt level at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 is primarily driven by a $1 billion long-term bond issuance in the second quarter of 2021 (see Note 18- Long-term Debt, to our consolidated financial statements), from which a portion of the proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt, in addition to increased cash from operations used to pay down debt in the current year.\nTrade accounts payable - Trade accounts payable were $4,250 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $1,614 million from $2,636 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in Trade accounts payable was primarily due to higher average inventory purchase prices during the current year as well as the timing of payments.\nOther current liabilities - Other current liabilities, including Liabilities held for sale, were $3,547 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1,731 million from $5,278 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to decreased unrealized losses on derivative contracts, the sale of our United States interior grain assets that were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2020, and a payment to acquire the noncontrolling equity interests in our Z.T. Kruszwica S.A. subsidiary in Europe during the year ended December 31, 2021 (see Note 13- Other Current Liabilities, to our consolidated financial statements). The Liabilities held for sale balance as of December 31, 2021 relates to the classification of our Mexico wheat milling business as held for sale during the current year (see Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions, to our consolidated financial statements).\nDebt\nFinancing Arrangements and Outstanding Indebtedness-We conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure that provides the company with efficient access to debt and capital markets. This structure includes a master trust, the primary assets of which comprise intercompany loans made to Bunge Limited and its subsidiaries. Certain of Bunge Limited's 100% owned finance subsidiaries, Bunge Limited Finance Corp., Bunge Finance Europe B.V. and Bunge Asset Funding Corp., fund the master trust with short and long-term debt obtained from third parties, including through our commercial paper program and certain credit facilities, as well as the issuance of senior notes. Borrowings by these finance subsidiaries carry full, unconditional guarantees by Bunge Limited.\nRevolving Credit Facilities-At December 31, 2021, we had $5,565 million of aggregate committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program and various revolving bilateral and syndicated credit facilities, all of which was unused and available. The following table summarizes these facilities for the years presented:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Committed\nCapacity (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Borrowings\nOutstanding </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Paper Program and Revolving Credit Facilities (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Maturities </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper </td> <td> </td> <td>2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>549 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1 Billion 364-day Revolving Credit Agreement (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1.75 Billion 2024 Revolving Credit Facility (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>554 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1.35 Billion 5-year Revolving Credit Agreement (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$865 Million 2026 Revolving Credit Facility (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revolving credit facilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>944 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,493 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)See Note 17- Short-term Debt and Credit Facilities for further information on these programs.\n(2)The $1 Billion 364-day Revolving Credit Agreement replaced the $1.25 Billion 364-day Revolving Credit Agreement that was in place as of December 31, 2020 and set to mature on October 21, 2021.\n(3)The $1.75 Billion 2024 Revolving Credit Facility replaced the $1.75 Billion 2022 Revolving Credit Facility that was in place as of December 31, 2020 and set to mature on December 12, 2022.\n(4)The $1.35 Billion Credit Agreement replaced the $1.1 billion five-year syndicated revolving credit agreement that was in place as of December 31, 2020 and set to mature on December 14, 2023.\n(5)The $865 Million 2026 Facility replaced the $865 million revolving credit facility that was in place as of December 31, 2020 and set to mature on September 6, 2022.\n(6)Total committed capacity for our commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities excludes the committed capacity of our $250 million delayed draw term loan required to be drawn by October 29, 2022 (see Note 18- Long-term Debt).\nShort and long-term debt-Our short and long-term debt decreased by $1,324 million at December 31, 2021 from December 31, 2020, primarily due to cash inflows from operations, including net proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables. These cash inflows helped to reduce the debt required to fund the increased working capital requirements throughout the year. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our average short and long-term debt outstanding was approximately $7,181 million compared to approximately $6,100 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our long-term debt outstanding balance, including the current-portion of long-term debt, was $5,291 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $4,460 million at December 31, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes our short-term debt activity at December 31, 2021.\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Outstanding\nBalance at\nDecember 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nInterest\nRate at\nDecember 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Highest\nBalance\nOutstanding\nDuring\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nBalance\nDuring\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nInterest\nRate\nDuring\n2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank Borrowings(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Paper </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.90 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes $566 million of local currency bank borrowings in certain European, South American and Asia-Pacific countries at a weighted average interest rate of 23.14% as of December 31, 2021.\nFrom time to time, through our financing subsidiaries, we enter into bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary based on our financing requirements. At December 31, 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding under these bilateral short-term credit lines. In addition, Bunge's operating companies had $673 million and $785 million in short-term borrowings outstanding from local bank lines of credit at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, to support working capital requirements.\nOn October 29, 2021, we entered into an unsecured $250 million delayed draw term loan (the \"$250 Million Delayed Draw Term Loan\") with a group of lenders that is required to be drawn by October 29, 2022. The $250 Million Delayed Draw Term Loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin, as defined in the $250 Million Delayed Draw Term Loan agreement. The $250 Million Delayed Draw Term Loan matures on October 29, 2028 and was not drawn as of December 31, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes our short and long-term debt:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt: (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,828 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total short-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>1,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,836 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan due 2024 - three-month Yen LIBOR plus 0.75% (Tranche A) (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan due 2024 - three-month LIBOR plus 1.30% (Tranche B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.00% Senior Notes due 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.85% Senior Notes due 2023 - Euro </td> <td> </td> <td>906 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>982 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.35% Senior Notes due 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>597 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.63% Senior Notes due 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>595 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.25% Senior Notes due 2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>696 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.75% Senior Notes due 2027 </td> <td> </td> <td>596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>595 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.75% Senior Notes due 2031(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Subtotal </td> <td> </td> <td>5,291 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,460 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Current portion of long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>(504) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,452 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes secured debt of $43 million and $1 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n(2) Includes $566 million and $558 million of local currency borrowings in certain European, South American, and Asia-Pacific countries at a weighted average interest rate of 23.14% and 24.54% as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n(3) See Note 18- Long-term Debt for further information on the 2.75% Senior Notes due 2031.\n(4) Includes secured debt of $50 million and $5 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n(5) Effective January 1, 2022, the three-month Yen LIBOR rate was discontinued and replaced by the Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (\"TONAR\" or \"TONA\").\nCredit Ratings-Bunge's debt ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Short-term\nDebt(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Long-term\nDebt </td> <td> </td> <td>Outlook </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's </td> <td>A-1 </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's </td> <td>P-1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Short-term rating applies only to Bunge Asset Funding Corp., the issuer under our commercial paper program.\nOur debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt. However, credit rating downgrades would increase borrowing costs under our credit facilities and, depending on their severity, could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on competitive terms. A significant increase in our borrowing costs could impair our ability to compete effectively in our business relative to competitors with higher credit ratings.\nOur credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants, including minimum net worth, minimum current ratio, maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and limitations on secured indebtedness. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2021.\nTrade Receivable Securitization Program\nThe Company, and certain of its subsidiaries participate in a trade receivable securitization program (the \"Program\") with a financial institution, as administrative agent, and certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the \"Purchasers\") that provides for funding of up to $925 million against receivables sold into the Program. The Program, which provides us with an additional source of liquidity, terminates on May 17, 2024, unless extended for an additional period in accordance with the terms of the receivables transfer agreement.\nOur risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables under the program is limited to the deferred purchase price receivable (the \"DPP\"), which at December 31, 2021 and 2020 had a fair value of $496 million and $177 million, respectively, and is included in Other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 4- Trade Accounts Receivable and Trade Receivable Securitization Program to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The DPP will be repaid in cash as receivables are collected, generally within 30 days. Delinquencies and credit losses on trade receivables sold under the Program during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were insignificant.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nWe may use interest rate swaps as hedging instruments and record the swaps at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings. Additionally, the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in fair value due to changes in benchmark interest rates. See Note 16- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to our consolidated financial statements.\nEquity\nTotal equity is set forth in the following table:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible perpetual preference shares </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>690 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common shares </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional paid-in capital </td> <td> </td> <td>5,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,408 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retained earnings </td> <td> </td> <td>8,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,236 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated other comprehensive loss </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,471) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,246) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury shares, at cost (2021-16,726,697 and 2020-15,428,313)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(1,120) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,020) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Bunge shareholders' equity </td> <td> </td> <td>7,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,069 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests </td> <td> </td> <td>156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total equity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,825 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Bunge shareholders' equity was $7,669 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $6,069 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in Bunge shareholders' equity during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to $2,078 million of Net income attributable to Bunge and $122 million from the issuance of common shares under our share based compensation programs, partially offset by $225 million of Other comprehensive loss, primarily driven by currency translation adjustments, $294 million and $34 million of declared dividends to common and preferred shareholders, respectively, and $100 million of common share repurchases.\nNoncontrolling interest increased to $156 million at December 31, 2021 from $136 million at December 31, 2020 primarily due to Net income attributable to our noncontrolling interest entities, offset by dividends paid to non-controlling interest holders.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had 6,899,683 4.875% cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of $690 million. Each convertible perpetual preference share has an initial liquidation preference of $100, per share plus accumulated unpaid dividends up to a maximum of an additional $25 per share. The convertible perpetual preference shares carry an annual dividend of $4.875 per share payable quarterly. As a result of adjustments made to the initial conversion price because cash dividends paid on Bunge Limited's common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds, each convertible perpetual preference share is convertible, at the holder's option, at any time into 1.2799 Bunge Limited common shares, based on the conversion price of $78.1322 per share, subject to certain additional anti-dilution adjustments (which represents 8,830,904 Bunge Limited common shares at December 31, 2021). At any time, if the closing price of our common shares equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading days (including the last trading day of such period), we may elect to cause the convertible perpetual preference\nshares to be automatically converted into Bunge Limited common shares at the then-prevailing conversion price. The convertible perpetual preference shares are not redeemable by us at any time.\nShare repurchase program - In May 2015, we established a program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our issued and outstanding common shares. The program has no expiration date. Bunge repurchased 1,298,384 common shares under this program during the year ended December 31, 2021, for $100 million, and 2,546,000 common shares under this program during the year ended December 31, 2020, for $100 million. Total repurchases under the program from its inception in May 2015 through December 31, 2021 were 8,551,824 shares for $500 million.\nDuring October 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our issued and outstanding common shares. The program has no expiration date, and there have been no repurchases under this program as of December 31, 2021.\nCash Flows\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>US$ in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used for operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,894) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,536) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(808) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>5,113 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,503 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used for) provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,632) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(771) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>(63) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(71) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur cash flows from operations vary depending on, among other items, the market prices and timing of the purchase and sale of our inventories. Generally, during periods when commodity prices are rising, our Agribusiness operations require increased use of cash to support working capital to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange traded futures that we use to minimize price risk related to the purchase and sale of our inventories.\n2021 Compared to 2020\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash increased $524 million, compared to a decrease of $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOperating: Cash used for operating activities was $2,894 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $642 million compared to cash used for operating activities of $3,536 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to higher Net income and lower cash required to fund working capital, partially offset by increased Beneficial interest in securitized trade receivables driven by increased sales during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>US$ in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used for operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,894) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,536) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net proceeds from beneficial interest in securitized trade receivables </td> <td> </td> <td>5,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,943 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used for) operating activities, adjusted </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,593) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities, adjusted for proceeds from beneficial interest in securitized trade receivables was $2,163 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to cash used for operating activities of $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily due to higher Net income, net of non-cash gains and losses, during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCertain of our non-U.S. operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with U.S. dollar-denominated debt, while currency risk is hedged with U.S. dollar-denominated assets. The functional currency of our operating subsidiaries is generally the local currency. The financial statements of our subsidiaries are calculated in the functional currency, and when the local currency is the functional currency, translated into U.S. dollars. U.S. dollar-denominated loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. Also, certain of our U.S. dollar functional operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. are partially funded with local currency borrowings, while the currency risk is hedged with local\ncurrency denominated assets. Local currency loans in U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries outside the U.S. are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the applicable balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange (losses) gains - net. For the year ended December 31, 2021 we recorded a foreign currency loss on net debt of $78 million versus a foreign currency gain on net debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $206 million, which were included as adjustments to reconcile Net income to Cash used for operating activities in the line item \"Foreign exchange (gain) loss on net debt\" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. This adjustment is required as the gains and losses are non-cash items that arise from financing activities and therefore will have no impact on cash flows from operations.\nInvesting: Cash provided by investing activities was $5,113 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1,813 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $3,300 million. The increase was primarily due to higher net proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables as well as proceeds from the sales of our United States interior grain elevators and oils facilities in Rotterdam and in Mexico, partially offset by increased net payments for investments for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables was $5,057 million. We also generated proceeds from the divestiture of businesses and disposal of property, plant and equipment of $647 million driven by proceeds from the sales of our United States interior grain elevators and oils facilities in Rotterdam and in Mexico. In addition, we received proceeds from investments of $171 million, primarily promissory notes related to financial services investments, which were more than offset by payments of $308 million for such investments. We also made payments for capital expenditures of $399 million related to capital projects at various facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables was $1,943 million. We also generated proceeds from the divestiture of businesses and disposal of property, plant and equipment of $194 million driven by proceeds from sales of our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise business and a U.S. rice mill. In addition, we received proceeds from investments of $305 million, primarily from promissory notes related to financial services investments, which were more than offset by payments of $337 million for such investments. We also made payments for capital expenditures of $365 million related to capital projects at various facilities.\nFinancing: Cash used for financing activities was $1,632 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $3,395 million, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1,763 million for the year ended December 31, 2020,\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net cash repayments from short-term and long-term debt of $1,097 million, primarily driven by net repayments of Short-term debt, partially offset by proceeds from Long-term debt resulting from our $1 Billion bond issuance in May 2021. Short-term debt is primarily used to fund seasonal working capital requirements, mostly comprising RMI, which can fluctuate based on funding requirements. Additionally, we paid $147 million to acquire the noncontrolling equity interest of our Polish subsidiary, Z.T. Kruszwica S.A. (see Note 13- Other Current Liabilities, to our consolidated financial statements), paid dividends of $323 million to our common shareholders and holders of our convertible preference shares, paid $76 million in dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders of certain of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries, primarily Loders, and repurchased $100 million of common shares. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash proceeds from short-term and long-term debt were $2,202 million, primarily used to fund seasonal working capital requirements, mostly comprising RMI. We also paid dividends of $316 million to our common shareholders and holders of our convertible preference shares and repurchased $100 million of common shares.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nIn 2020, our cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased by $59 million, compared to a decrease of $71 million in 2019.\nOperating: Cash used for operating activities was $3,536 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2,728 million compared to cash used for operating activities of $808 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to higher working capital funding requirements, primarily RMI and proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables, as a result of higher average commodity prices, partially offset by higher net income during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>US$ in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used for) operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,536) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(808) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net proceeds from beneficial interest in securitized trade receivables </td> <td> </td> <td>1,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,312 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used for) operating activities, adjusted </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,593) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash used for operating activities, adjusted for proceeds from beneficial interest in securitized trade receivables was $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $504 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in cash provided by (used for) operating activities is due to higher working capital funding requirements, primarily RMI, partially offset by higher net income during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCertain of our non-U.S. operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with U.S. dollar-denominated debt, while currency risk is hedged with U.S. dollar-denominated assets. The functional currency of our operating subsidiaries is generally the local currency. The financial statements of our subsidiaries are calculated in the functional currency, and when the local currency is the functional currency, translated into U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar-denominated loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. Also, certain of our U.S. dollar functional operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. are partially funded with local currency borrowings, while the currency risk is hedged with local currency denominated assets. Local currency loans in U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries outside the U.S. are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the applicable balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains or losses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a foreign currency gain on net debt of $206 million versus a foreign currency loss on net debt for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $139 million, which were included as adjustments to reconcile Net income to Cash used for operating activities in the line item \"Foreign exchange (gain) loss on net debt\" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. This adjustment is required as these losses are non-cash items that arise from financing activities and therefore will have no impact on cash flows from operations.\nInvesting: Cash provided by investing activities was $1,813 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,503 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $310 million. The increase was primarily due to higher proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables, lower capital expenditures, and higher cash inflows from settlements of net investment hedges, offset by lower net proceeds from investments and the divestiture of businesses and property, plant and equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables was $1,943 million. In addition, we received proceeds from investments of $305 million, primarily promissory notes related to financial services investments, which were more than offset by payments of $337 million for such investments. We also made payments for capital expenditures of $365 million related to capital projects at various facilities and received $65 million in proceeds from the settlement of net investment hedges of certain of our foreign operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables was $1,312 million. In addition, we received proceeds from investments of $449 million, primarily from promissory notes related to financial services investments, partially offset by payments of $393 million made for such investments. We also made payments for capital expenditures of $524 million, which primarily related to the replanting of sugarcane in our Brazilian sugar and biofuels business that was contributed to the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture in late 2019, as well as other capital projects at various facilities.\nFinancing: Cash provided by financing activities was $1,763 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2,534 million, compared to cash used by financing activities of $771 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net cash proceeds from short-term and long-term debt of $2,202 million, primarily used to fund seasonal working capital requirements, mostly comprising RMI. We also paid dividends of $316 million to our common shareholders and holders of our convertible preference shares, and we repurchased $100 million of common shares. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash repayments of short-term and long-term debt were $438 million, primarily due to lower overall debt needs following the transfer of our industrial sugar business in Brazil to the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture. In addition, we paid dividends of $317 million to our common shareholders and holders of our convertible preference shares.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur cash payments made for capital expenditures were $399 million, $365 million and $524 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We intend to make capital expenditures in the range of $650 million to $750 million in 2022. Our priorities for 2022 are to maintain the cash generating capacity of our assets through non-discretionary projects, such as maintenance, safety and compliance, as well as discretionary investments in growth and productivity projects, focusing on our strategy to strengthen our oilseeds platform, increase participation in biofuels and plant-based proteins, and grow our value-added oils business. These discretionary and non-discretionary capital investments will also help us achieve certain of our environmental and sustainability related objectives. We intend to fund these capital expenditures primarily with cash flows from operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nGuarantees\nWe have issued or were party to the following guarantees at December 31, 2021:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td>Maximum Potential\nFuture Payments </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconsolidated affiliates guarantee (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>244 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residual value guarantee (2)\n</td> <td>271 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other guarantees </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>522 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)We have issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of our unconsolidated affiliates. The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings which have maturity dates through 2034. There are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. In addition, one of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the obligations of two of its affiliates, and in connection therewith, has secured its guarantee obligations through a pledge of one of its affiliate's shares plus loans receivable from the affiliate to the financial institutions in the event that the guaranteed obligations are enforced. Based on the amounts drawn under such debt facilities at December 31, 2021, our potential liability was $234 million, and we have recorded a $7 million obligation related to these guarantees.\n(2)We have issued guarantees to certain financial institutions that are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars and barges. These guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at conclusion of the lease term. These leases expire at various dates from 2022 through 2028. At December 31, 2021, no obligation has been recorded related to these guarantees. Any obligation recorded would be recognized in Current operating lease obligations or Non-current operating lease obligations (see Note 27- Leases, to our consolidated financial statements).\nWe have provided a guaranty to the Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture as Trustee for Bunge North America, Inc. (\"BNA\"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, which guarantees all amounts due and owing by BNA, to grain producers and/or depositors in the State of Illinois who have delivered commodities to BNA's Illinois facilities.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations and their expected maturities at December 31, 2021, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods indicated.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td>Total </td> <td>2022 </td> <td>2023 - 2024 </td> <td>2025 - 2026 </td> <td>2027 and thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>673 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>673 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>5,316 </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,904 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,301 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable interest rate obligations </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest obligations on fixed rate debt </td> <td>677 </td> <td> </td> <td>155 </td> <td> </td> <td>221 </td> <td> </td> <td>155 </td> <td> </td> <td>146 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancelable lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>930 </td> <td> </td> <td>372 </td> <td> </td> <td>354 </td> <td> </td> <td>126 </td> <td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital commitments </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freight supply agreements(3)\n</td> <td>231 </td> <td> </td> <td>231 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory purchase commitments </td> <td>426 </td> <td> </td> <td>409 </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power supply purchase commitments </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commitments and obligations(4)\n</td> <td>215 </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations(5)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,649 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,628 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,568 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,610 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,843 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes components of long-term debt attributable to unamortized premiums of $26 million and excludes components of long-term debt attributable to fair value hedge accounting of $1 million.\n(2)Represents future minimum payments under non-cancelable leases with initial terms of one year or more. Minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease income receipts of $31 million due in future periods under non-cancelable subleases.\n(3)Represents purchase commitments for time on ocean freight vessels and railroad freight lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities. The ocean freight service agreements are short term contracts with a duration of less than a year. Ocean freight service agreements with terms in excess of one year are included in non-cancelable lease obligations. The railroad freight service agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used. The costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products. However, changes in the market value of such freight services compared to the rates at which we have contracted them may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities.\n(4)Represents other purchase commitments and obligations, such as take-or-pay contracts, throughput contracts, and debt commitment fees.\n(5)Does not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions. As of December 31, 2021, Bunge had uncertain income tax liabilities of $81 million, including interest and penalties. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table. See Note 14- Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe expect to contribute $21 million to our defined benefit pension plans and $4 million to our postretirement benefit plans in 2022.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make substantial judgment or estimation in their application that may significantly affect reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nOffsetting\nIn the normal course of its operations we routinely enter into transactions resulting in the recognition of assets and liabilities stemming from unconditional obligations, for example trade receivables and trade payables, or conditional obligations, for example unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts at fair value, with the same counterparty. We generally record all such assets and liabilities on a gross basis, even when they are subject to master netting agreements.\nHowever, we also engage in various trade structured finance activities to leverage the value of our global trade flows. These activities include programs under which we generally obtain U.S. dollar-denominated letters of credit (\"LCs\") from financial institutions, each based on an underlying commodity trade flow, time deposits denominated in either the local currency of the financial institutions' counterparties or in U.S. dollars, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts. Trade related payables are set-off against receivables under such arrangements when all related assets and liabilities are subject to legally enforceable set-off agreements and the criteria of ASC 210-20, Offsetting, has been met. Cash inflows are offset by the related cash outflows resulting from placement of the time deposits and repayment of the LCs. All cash flows related to the programs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nTranslation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. As such, amounts included in the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and changes in equity are translated using average exchange rates during each period. Assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates and resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. However, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, if a foreign entity's economy is determined to be highly inflationary, then such foreign entity's financial statements are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency.\nForeign Currency Transactions\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net unless the remeasurement gain or loss relates to an intercompany transaction that is of a long-term investment nature and for which settlement is neither planned nor anticipated in the foreseeable future, in which case the remeasurement gain or loss is reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets.\nInventories and Derivatives\nOur RMI, forward RMI purchase and sale contracts, and exchange-traded futures and options are primarily valued at fair value. RMI are freely-traded, have quoted market prices, may be sold without significant additional processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. We estimate the fair values of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts on these inventories based on commodity futures exchange quotations, broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter (\"OTC\") markets with appropriate adjustments for differences in local markets where our inventories are located. Certain inventories may utilize significant unobservable data related to local market adjustments to determine fair value. The significant unobservable inputs for RMI and physically-settled forward purchase and sale contracts relate to certain management estimates regarding transportation costs and other local market or location-related adjustments, primarily freight-related adjustments in the interior of Brazil and the lack of market corroborated information in Canada. In both situations, we use proprietary information such as purchase and sale contracts and contracted prices to value freight, premiums, and discounts in our contracts. Changes in the fair values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of Cost of goods sold. If we used different methods or factors to estimate fair values, amounts reported as Inventories and Unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and Cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income, respectively, could differ. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as Inventories, Unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts, and Cost of goods sold could differ.\nAllowances for Uncollectible Accounts\nTrade Accounts Receivable-Trade accounts receivable are stated at historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. We establish allowances for uncollectible trade accounts receivable based on lifetime expected credit losses using an aging schedule for each pool of trade accounts receivable. Pools are determined based on risk characteristics such as the type of customer and geography. A default rate is derived using a provision matrix based on Bunge's historical receivables data. The default rate is then applied to the pool to determine the allowance for expected credit losses. Given the short term nature of our trade accounts receivable, the default rate is only adjusted if significant changes in the credit profile of the portfolio are identified (e.g., poor crop years, credit issues at the country level, systematic risk), resulting in historic loss rates that are not representative of forecasted losses. Uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when we have determined that collection of the balance is unlikely.\nSpecifically, in establishing appropriate default rates as of December 31, 2021, we took into consideration expected impacts on our customers and other debtors in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, which did not result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe record and report accrued interest receivable within the same line item as the related receivable. The allowance for expected credit losses is estimated on the amortized cost basis of the trade accounts receivable, including accrued interest receivable. We recognize credit loss expense when establishing an allowance for accrued interest receivable.\nSecured Advances to Suppliers-Secured advances to suppliers are stated at historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. Secured advances to suppliers are expected to be settled through delivery of non-cash assets and as such, allowances are established when collection is not probable. We establish an allowance for secured advances to suppliers, generally farmers and resellers of grain, based on historical experience, farming economics and other market conditions as well as specific customer collection issues. Uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount below the outstanding historical balance or when we have determined that collection is unlikely.\nSecured advances to suppliers bear interest at contractual rates that reflect current market interest rates at the time of the transaction. There are no deferred fees or costs associated with these receivables. As a result, there are no imputed interest amounts to be amortized under the interest method. Interest income is calculated based on the terms of the individual agreements and is recognized on an accrual basis.\nWe follow accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses, which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels, defined as portfolio segments and classes. Under this guidance, secured advances to suppliers are considered impaired, based on current information and events, if we\ndetermine it probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected. Recognition of interest income is suspended once the borrower defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. No additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, at which time amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income.\nGoodwill\nWhen we acquire a business, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market participants, projected growth rates, the amounts and timing of future cash flows, and the discount rates applied to the cash flows. Determining the useful life of an asset also requires significant judgment.\nOur goodwill balance is not amortized to expense. Instead, it is tested for impairment at least annually. We generally perform our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter. If events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment analyses, we perform an impairment analysis at that date. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant asset. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) determine our reporting units; (2) allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (3) determine the carrying value, or book value, of our reporting units; (4) estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model and/or using market multiples; (5) compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value; and (6) if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment charge for such amount, but not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis, including the identification of our reporting units, identification and allocation of the assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units, and determination of fair value. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic impairment analysis, we make estimates and significant judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit aligned with management's strategic business plans. Changes in judgment related to these assumptions and estimates could result in goodwill impairment charges. We believe the assumptions and estimates used are appropriate based on the information currently available to management. Estimates based on market earnings multiples of peer companies identified for the reporting unit may also be used, where available. Critical estimates in the determination of fair value under the income approach include, but are not limited to, assumptions about variables such as commodity prices, crop throughput and production volumes, profitability, future capital expenditures and discount rates, all of which are subject to a high degree of judgment.\nDuring the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined the estimated fair values of each of our goodwill reporting units exceeded each of their carrying values. See Note 8- Goodwill, to our consolidated financial statements. Please refer to Note 10- Impairments to our consolidated financial statements for details of goodwill impairment charges recorded in the three years ended December 31, 2021.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. Property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life on a straight line basis. When facts and circumstances indicate the carrying values of these assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the undiscounted projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets from their use and ultimate disposal. If the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss in the amount that carrying value exceeds fair value. Impairment is recognized as a charge against results of operations. Our judgments related to the expected useful lives of these assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. As we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of these assets, changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges. Please refer to Note 10- Impairments to our consolidated financial statements for details of property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible asset impairment charges recorded in the three years ended December 31, 2021.\nContingencies\nWe are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits, primarily non-income tax and labor claims in Brazil and non-income tax claims in Argentina, and we make provisions for potential liabilities arising from such claims when we deem them probable and reasonably estimable. These estimates of probable loss have been developed in consultation with in-house and outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.\nFuture results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings. For more information on tax and labor claims in Brazil, see \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and Note 21- Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize. We consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the amount of the valuation allowances. If we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount, we decrease the valuation allowance, thereby decreasing income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset, we increase the valuation allowance, thereby increasing income tax expense.\nWe apply a \"more likely than not\" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. The calculation of our uncertain tax positions involves complexities in the application of intricate tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Future changes in judgment related to the ultimate resolution of unrecognized tax benefits will affect the earnings in the quarter of such change. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had recorded uncertain tax positions of $81 million and $52 million, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. For additional information on income taxes, please refer to Note 14- Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecoverable Taxes\nWe evaluate the collectability of our recoverable taxes and record allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful. Recoverable taxes include value-added taxes paid upon the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, raw materials and taxable services, as well as other transactional taxes, which can be recovered in cash or as compensation against income taxes, or other taxes we may owe, primarily in Brazil and Europe. Management's assumption about the collectability of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes. The balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories, purchases of new inventories, percentages of export sales, seasonality, changes in applicable tax rates, cash payments by the applicable government agencies and the offset of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments, where permissible. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowance for recoverable taxes was $44 million and $58 million, respectively. We continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and in cases where we determine that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated

"item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following should be read in conjunction with \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating Results\nFactors Affecting Operating Results\nBunge Limited, a Bermuda company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global agribusiness and food company with integrated operations that stretch from farmer to consumer. The commodity nature of the Company's principal products, as well as regional and global supply and demand variations that occur as an inherent part of the business, make volumes an important operating measure. Accordingly, information is included in \"Segment Results\" that summarizes certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment. The common unit of measure for all reported volumes is metric tons. A description of reported volumes for each reportable segment has also been included in the discussion of key factors affecting results of operations in each of our business segments as discussed below.\nAgribusiness\nIn the Agribusiness segment, we purchase, store, transport, process and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products. Profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy, transportation, and logistics services. Profitability in our processing operations is also impacted by volumes procured, processed and sold and by capacity utilization rates. Availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors, including weather, farmer planting and selling decisions, plant diseases, governmental policies, and agricultural sector economic conditions. Reported volumes in this segment primarily reflect (i) grains and oilseeds originated from farmers, cooperatives or other aggregators and from which \"origination margins\" are earned; (ii) oilseeds processed in our oilseed processing facilities and from which \"crushing margins\" are earned, representing the margin from the industrial separation of the oilseed into its protein meal and vegetable oil components, both of which are separate commodity products; and (iii) third party sales of grains, oilseeds and related commodity products merchandised through our distribution businesses and from which \"distribution margins\" are earned. The foregoing subsegment volumes may overlap as they produce separate margin capture opportunities. For example, oilseeds procured in our South American grain origination activities may be processed in our oilseed processing facilities in Asia-Pacific and will be reflected at both points within the segment. As such, these reported volumes do not represent solely volumes of net sales to third-parties, but rather where margin is earned, appropriately reflecting their contribution to our global network's capacity utilization and profitability.\nDemand for our purchased and processed Agribusiness products is affected by many factors, including global and regional economic conditions, changes in per capita income, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, particularly pork and poultry, population growth rates, relative prices of substitute agricultural products, outbreaks of disease associated with livestock and poultry, and demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products.\nWe expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global supply and demand for our Agribusiness products for the foreseeable future. We also expect that, from time to time, imbalances will likely exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions, which impacts our decisions regarding whether, when and where to purchase, store, transport, process or sell these commodities, including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity.\nAdditionally, price fluctuations and availability of commodities may cause fluctuations in our working capital, such as inventories, accounts receivable and borrowings over the course of a given year. For example, increased availability of commodities at harvest times often causes fluctuations in our inventories and borrowings. Increases in agricultural commodity prices will also generally cause our cash flow requirements to increase as our operations require increased use of cash to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange-traded futures that we use to hedge our physical inventories.\nRefined and Specialty Oils\nIn the Refined and Specialty Oils segment, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials such as crude vegetable oils, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita income, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets. Raw material inputs to our production processes in the Refined and Specialty Oils segment are largely sourced at market prices from our Agribusiness segment. Reported volumes in this segment reflect third-party sales of our finished products and, as such, include the sales of products\nderived from raw materials sourced from the Agribusiness segment as well as from third-parties. The unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials, which are their primary inputs.\nMilling\nIn the Milling segment, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials such as grains, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita income, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets. Raw material inputs to our production processes in the Milling segment are largely sourced at market prices from our Agribusiness segment. Reported volumes in these segments reflect third-party sales of our finished products and, as such, include the sales of products derived from raw materials sourced from the Agribusiness segment as well as from third-parties. The unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials, which are their primary inputs.\nSugar and Bioenergy\nOur Sugar and Bioenergy segment primarily comprises our 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, the joint venture formed in December 2019 by the combination of our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations with the Brazilian biofuels business of BP. Until December 2019, our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations formed the majority of our Sugar and Bioenergy segment through which we produced and sold sugar and ethanol derived from sugarcane, as well as energy derived from the sugar and ethanol production process. BP Bunge Bioenergia operates on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North and Midwest regions of Brazil. Following the joint venture's formation we no longer consolidate our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations in our consolidated financial statements and instead account for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our reported Sugar and Bioenergy results for 2021 and 2020 include our share of the net earnings in BP Bunge Bioenergia, whereas our Sugar and Bioenergy results for 2019 reflect our former 100% ownership interest in the Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations contributed to the joint venture. Although we are committed to supporting the growth and development of BP Bunge Bioenergia, our long-term goal is to seek strategic opportunities for our investment in the joint venture.\nProfitability in this segment is affected by the profitability of the joint venture and, therefore the value of our investment and the amount and timing of distributions we receive, if any. In turn, the profitability of the joint venture is affected by the availability and quality of sugarcane, which impacts capacity utilization rates and the amount of sugar that can be extracted from the sugarcane, and by market prices of sugar and ethanol. The availability and quality of sugarcane is affected by many factors, including weather, geographical factors such as soil quality and topography, and agricultural practices. Once planted, sugarcane may be harvested for several continuous years, but the yield decreases with each subsequent harvest. As a result, the current optimum economic cycle is generally five to seven consecutive harvests, depending on location. The joint venture owns and/or has partnership agreements to manage farmland on which it grows and harvests sugarcane and also purchases sugarcane from third parties. Prices of sugarcane in Brazil are established by Consecana, the state of S\u00e3o Paulo sugarcane, sugar and ethanol council, and are based on the sucrose content of the cane and the market prices of sugar and ethanol. Demand for the joint venture's products is affected by such factors as changes in global or regional economic conditions, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, population growth rates, changes in per capita income and demand for and governmental support of renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities, including sugarcane.\nIn addition to these industry related factors which impact our business areas, our results of operations in all business areas and segments are affected by the following factors:\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nDue to the global nature of our operations, our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. Both translation of our foreign subsidiaries' financial statements and foreign currency transactions can affect our results. On a monthly basis, for subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar, subsidiary statements of income and cash flows must be translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted-average exchange rates in each monthly period. As a result, fluctuations of local currencies compared to the U.S. dollar during each monthly period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each reported period (per quarter and year-to-date) and also affect comparisons between those reported periods. Subsidiary balance sheets are translated using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nAdditionally, we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity. These amounts are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates as\nof the balance sheet date, with the resulting gains or losses included in the entity's statement of income and, therefore, in our consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net.\nWe primarily use a combination of equity and intercompany loans to finance our subsidiaries. Intercompany loans that are of a long-term investment nature with no intention of repayment in the foreseeable future are considered permanently invested and as such are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses on such permanently invested intercompany loans are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets. In contrast, foreign currency translation gains or losses on intercompany loans that are not of a permanent nature are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a Bermuda exempted company, we are not subject to income taxes in our jurisdiction of incorporation. However, our subsidiaries, which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions, are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from 0% to 35%. The jurisdictions that significantly impact our effective tax rate are Brazil, the United States, Argentina, Switzerland and Bermuda. Determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nTotal segment earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") is an operating performance measure used by Bunge's management to evaluate segment operating activities. Bunge also uses Core Segment EBIT, Non-core Segment EBIT and Total Segment EBIT to evaluate the operating performance of Bunge's Core reportable segments, Non-core reportable segments, and total reportable segments together with Corporate and Other. Core Segment EBIT is the aggregate of the EBIT of each of Bunge's Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments. Non-core Segment EBIT is the EBIT of Bunge's Sugar & Bioenergy segment. Total Segment EBIT is the aggregate of the EBIT of Bunge's Core and Non-core reportable segments, together with Corporate and Other. Bunge's management believes Core Segment EBIT, Non-core Segment EBIT and Total Segment EBIT are useful measures of operating profitability since the measures allow for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to financing methods or capital structure. In addition, EBIT is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in Bunge's industry. Total Segment EBIT is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Further, Total Segment EBIT excludes EBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests and is not a measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net income (loss) or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP. See the reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT below.\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities, adjusted is calculated by including the Net proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables with Cash provided by (used for) operating activities. Cash provided by (used for) operating activities, adjusted is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace Cash provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Our management believes presentation of this measure allows investors to view our cash generating performance using the same measure that management uses in evaluating financial and business performance and trends.\n2021 Overview\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Bunge - For the year ended December 31, 2021, Net income attributable to Bunge was $2,078 million, an increase of $933 million compared to a Net income attributable to Bunge of $1,145 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to higher Segment EBIT in our Core and Non-core segments, as further discussed in the Segment Overview and Results of Operations section below.\nEarnings Per Common Share - Diluted - For the year ended December 31, 2021, Net income attributable to Bunge common shareholders, diluted, was $13.64 per share, an increase of $5.93 per share, compared to $7.71 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEBIT - For the year ended December 31, 2021, Total Segment EBIT was $2,661 million, an increase of $1,028 million compared to EBIT of $1,633 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Total Segment EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to higher Segment EBIT in our Core and Non-core segments, as further discussed in the Segment Overview and Results of Operations section below, and which also provides a reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit - Income tax expense was $398 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to income tax expense of $248 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in income tax expense\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to higher pretax income, resulting from higher EBIT in our Core and Non-core segments, as noted above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - At December 31, 2021, working capital, which equals total current assets less total current liabilities, was $7,136 million, an increase of $1,940 million, compared to working capital of $5,196 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in working capital is primarily due to higher commodity prices, including related increases in readily marketable inventories (\"RMI\") purchases, and lower short-term debt levels driven by a $1 billion long-term bond issuance in the second quarter of 2021 (see Note 18- Long-term Debt, to our consolidated financial statements), from which a portion of the proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt.\nSegment Overview and Results of Operations\nEffective January 1, 2021, we changed our reporting segments to align with our new value chain operational structure, as discussed in Note 28- Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements. Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts within the reporting segments have been made to conform to current presentation.\nOur operations are now organized, managed and classified into four reportable segments, organized based upon their similar economic characteristics, nature of products and services offered, production processes, types and classes of customer, and distribution methods. We further organize these reportable segments into Core operations and Non-core operations. Core operations comprise our Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments. Non-core operations comprise our Sugar & Bioenergy segment, which itself primarily comprises our 50% interest in the net earnings of BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture with BP p.l.c. (\"BP\").\nOur remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Corporate and Other. Corporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to our individual reporting segments because the operating performance of each reporting segment is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance program, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities.\nA reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT follows:\n\nCore Segments\nAgribusiness Segment\n\n2021 Compared to 2020\nAgribusiness segment Net sales increased by $13,589 million, or 45%, to $43,636 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $30,047 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, Net sales increased $7,125 million primarily due to significantly higher average sales prices in our soybean processing businesses in all regions, driven by higher commodity prices, and significantly higher average sales prices in our European softseed processing business. The above increases were partially offset by slightly lower volumes in most key regions.\n\u2022In Merchandising, Net sales increased $6,464 million due to significantly higher average sales prices, primarily in our global corn, global oil and global wheat businesses, driven by higher commodity prices, and higher sales in our ocean freight business driven by increased global freight demand and related sales prices.\nCost of goods sold increased by $12,948 million, or 46%, to $41,133 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $28,185 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, Cost of goods sold increased by $6,492 million due to higher global commodity prices and related sales as noted above, as well as increased industrial input costs driven by inflation, in particular energy, partially offset by favorable mark-to-market results in our global soybean processing businesses.\n\u2022In Merchandising, Cost of goods sold increased by $6,456 million due to higher global commodity prices and related sales as noted above, as well as increased industrial input costs driven by inflation, in particular energy, and unfavorable mark-to-market results, primarily in our ocean freight business.\nGross profit increased by $641 million, or 34%, to $2,503 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,862 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, an increase of $633 million was due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, as a result of strong oil and meal demand leading to higher sales prices, coupled with favorable mark-to-market results, as described above.\n\u2022In Merchandising, an increase of $8 million was due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, as higher average sales prices were partially offset by unfavorable mark-to-market results, as described above.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses decreased $88 million, or 17%, to $432 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $520 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a higher portion of variable incentive costs being allocated to Corporate and Other activities in the current year, as well as favorable currency movements, primarily from the weakening of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real.\nForeign exchange gains (losses) - net decreased $174 million, to a loss of $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a gain of $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Foreign exchange results were primarily driven by losses on U.S. dollar denominated loans payable in non-U.S. functional currency operations.\nOther income (expenses) - net increased $173 million, to income of $215 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to income of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to a $158 million gain resulting from the sale of certain interior grain elevators located in the United States during 2021.\nSegment EBIT increased $730 million, or 47%, to $2,290 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,560 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, an increase of $558 million was primarily due to higher Gross profit, lower SG&A and higher Other income (expense) - net, partially offset by foreign exchange losses, as described above.\n\u2022In Merchandising, an increase of $172 million was primarily due to higher Gross profit, lower SG&A and higher Other income (expense) - net, partially offset by foreign exchange losses, as described above.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nAgribusiness segment Net sales increased by $1,127 million, or 4%, to $30,047 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $28,920 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, Net sales increased $638 million principally due to higher sales volumes in our South American, North American, and European and Asian soybean processing businesses, primarily driven by increased meal demand in China and increased oil demand in North America, as well as higher volumes and prices in our Canadian and European softseed processing businesses, driven by demand for renewable diesel.\n\u2022In Merchandising, Net sales increased $489 million primarily due to higher average sales prices and volumes in our global corn and global oil businesses, driven by increased demand in China following an easing of trade restrictions in place for much of 2019, as well as higher volumes in Brazil driven by increased farmer selling in response to depreciation of Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar earlier in the year. The above increases were partially offset by lower volumes in our global wheat business.\nCost of goods sold increased by $420 million, or 2%, to $28,185 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $27,765 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, Cost of goods sold increased by $195 million due to higher sales activity, as described above, as well as unfavorable mark-to-market results in our processing businesses, partially offset by favorable translation impacts on industrial costs as most currencies in which such expenses are denominated depreciated versus the U.S. dollar during 2020, as well as non-recurring prior year property, plant and equipment (PP&E) impairment charges at various facilities associated with portfolio rationalization initiatives.\n\u2022In Merchandising, Cost of goods sold increased by $225 million due to the higher sales activity noted above, partially offset by favorable mark-to-market results and translation impacts on industrial costs as most currencies in which such expenses are denominated depreciated versus the U.S. dollar during 2020, as well as non-recurring prior year PP&E impairment charges at various facilities associated with portfolio rationalization initiatives.\nGross profit increased by $707 million, or 61%, to $1,862 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,155 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, an increase of $443 million was due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, primarily driven by strong demand in our soybean processing businesses across all regions, as described above.\n\u2022In Merchandising, an increase of $264 million was due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, primarily driven by strong demand in our global corn and global oil businesses, as described above.\nSG&A expenses increased $30 million, or 6%, to $520 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $490 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly due to higher variable incentive costs on the back of improved overall company profitability, partially offset by savings associated with ongoing cost initiatives, lower expenses due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, favorable translation impacts as most currencies in which SG&A expenses are\ndenominated depreciated versus the U.S. dollar during 2020, and an $11 million prior year write-off of an indemnification asset associated with the reversal of an uncertain tax position.\nForeign exchange gains (losses) - net increased $186 million, to a gain of $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss of $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Foreign exchange results were primarily driven by gains on U.S. dollar denominated loans receivable in non-U.S. functional currency operations.\nOther income (expenses) - net decreased $23 million, to income of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to income of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower results from our financial services activities during 2020.\nSegment EBIT increased $823 million, or 112%, to $1,560 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $737 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, an increase of $543 million was primarily due to higher Gross profit and increased foreign exchange results, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses, as described above.\n\u2022In Merchandising, an increase of $280 million was primarily due to higher Gross profit and increased foreign exchange results, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses, as described above.\nRefined and Specialty Oils Segment\n\n2021 Compared to 2020\nRefined and Specialty Oils segment Net sales increased by $3,733 million, or 39%, to $13,332 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $9,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to significantly higher average selling prices in North America, Europe and Asia, driven by strong demand for renewable diesel and in food services. The above increases were partially offset by lower overall volumes, driven by our South American operations due to stay-at-home orders associated with COVID-19 earlier in the current year, as well as the sale of our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise assets in late 2020.\nCost of goods sold increased by $3,617 million, or 41%, to $12,476 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $8,859 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Cost of goods sold was due to higher raw material commodity prices as discussed above, higher industrial input costs, in particular energy, and a $50 million impairment charge, which includes $15 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, recorded in relation to an oils facility in China. These increases were partially offset by lower overall volumes as described in Net sales above.\nGross profit increased by $116 million, or 16%, to $856 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $740 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to the increase in Net sales in excess of the increase in Cost of goods sold, primarily driven by strong demand for renewable diesel and in food services, as described above.\nSG&A expenses decreased $36 million, or 9%, to $355 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $391 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher bad debt expense recorded in the prior year,\nfavorable currency movements, primarily from the weakening of the Brazilian real, and the allocation of a higher portion of variable incentive costs to Corporate and Other activities in the current year.\nEBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests, an expense when subsidiaries with noncontrolling interests generate earnings before interest and tax, versus income when subsidiaries with noncontrolling interests generate loss before interest and tax, decreased by $71 million, to expense of $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to expense of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The expense for the current year is primarily due to improved results in Bunge Loders Croklaan, including the noncontrolling interest share of the gain on sale of our Rotterdam oils refinery, partially offset by the noncontrolling interest share of an impairment charge on an oils facility in China.\nOther income (expenses) - net increased $144 million to income of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to income of $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Current period income was primarily due to a $219 million gain, which includes the amount attributable to noncontrolling interests, resulting on the sale of our Rotterdam oils refinery, as well as a $19 million gain on the sale of a Mexican oils packaging facility. Prior period income was due to a gain on the sale of our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise assets, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nSegment EBIT increased by $226 million, or 51%, to $666 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $440 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher Gross profit and Other income (expenses) - net, and lower SG&A, partially offset by higher EBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests, as described above.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nRefined and Specialty Oils segment Net sales increased by $406 million, or 4%, to $9,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $9,193 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to higher average selling prices in all regions, and higher sales volumes to food processor customers driven by increased at-home consumption associated with COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, partially offset by lower food services volumes, again due to COVID-19. The year ended December 31, 2020 also benefited from $47 million of indirect tax credits related to the favorable resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax claim.\nCost of goods sold increased by $277 million, or 3%, to $8,859 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $8,582 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in Cost of goods sold was due to higher Net sales, partially offset by favorable translation impacts, unfavorable mark-to-market results in 2019, and approximately $40 million of non-recurring PP&E impairment charges at various facilities associated with portfolio rationalization initiatives during 2019.\nGross profit increased by $129 million, or 21%, to $740 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $611 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, primarily related to food processor margin expansion resulting from increased at-home consumption associated with COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, as described above.\nSG&A expenses increased $16 million, or 4%, to $391 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $375 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher variable incentive costs on the back of improved overall company profitability and increased bad debt expense, partially offset by favorable translation impacts and lower travel costs associated with COVID-19 travel restrictions.\nOther income (expenses) - net increased $216 million, or 179%, to income of $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to expense of $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to a gain on the sale of our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise assets, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2020, and a 2019 goodwill impairment charge of $108 million, which includes $32 million attributable to noncontrolling interests associated with our Bunge Loders Croklaan joint venture.\nSegment EBIT increased by $319 million, or 264%, to $440 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher Gross profit and Other income (expenses) - net, as described above.\nMilling Segment\n\n2021 Compared to 2020\nMilling segment Net sales increased by $293 million, or 18%, to $1,909 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,616 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes and average sales prices in our South American and Mexican wheat milling businesses and higher average sales prices in our North American corn milling business, partially offset by lower volumes in North America due to the sale of our rice milling business in the prior year.\nCost of goods sold increased by $455 million, or 32%, to $1,882 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,427 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the increased sales activity noted above, higher industrial costs, in particular energy, and a non-recurring impairment charge of $170 million related to the classification of our Mexican wheat milling business as held-for-sale, as described further in Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes in North America resulting from the prior year sale of our rice business and favorable current year mark-to-market results.\nGross profit decreased by $162 million, or 86%, to $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $189 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in Cost of goods sold in excess of the increase in Net sales, mostly due to a non-recurring impairment charge of $170 million related to the classification of our Mexican wheat milling business as held-for-sale, as described above.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $4 million, or 4%, to $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a higher portion of variable incentive costs being allocated to Corporate and Other.\nSegment EBIT decreased by $165 million, or 181%, to a loss before interest and taxes of $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to earnings before interest and taxes of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower Gross profit, mostly driven by a non-recurring impairment charge of $170 million related to the classification of our Mexican wheat milling business as held-for-sale, as described above.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nMilling segment Net sales decreased by $123 million, or 7%, to $1,616 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,739 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower average sales prices in Brazil and Mexico, and lower sales prices in our U.S. corn milling business, which more than offset higher volumes.\nCost of goods sold decreased by $128 million, or 8%, to $1,427 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,555 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to lower Net sales, as described above, favorable translation impacts on industrial costs following depreciation of the Brazilian real and Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar in 2020, and approximately $28 million of non-recurring impairment charges associated with our U.S. extrusion business and portfolio rationalization initiatives in 2019.\nGross profit increased by $5 million, or 3%, to $189 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to a decrease in Cost of goods sold in excess of the decrease in Net sales, as described above.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $14 million, or 12%, to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $114 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as favorable translation impacts and lower travel costs associated with COVID-19 restrictions were partially offset by higher variable compensation costs associated with improved company profitability.\nOther income (expenses) - net decreased $23 million, to expense of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to income of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to a $19 million gain on the sale of two facilities in Brazil during 2019.\nSegment EBIT decreased $5 million, or 5%, to $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower Other income (expense) - net, partially offset by lower SG&A and higher Gross profit, as described above.\nCorporate and Other\n\n2021 Compared to 2020\nCorporate and Other EBIT improved $38 million, or 10%, to a loss of $333 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a loss of $371 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The improved result is primarily due to our corporate venture capital unit (Bunge Ventures) activities, which benefited from a net mark-to-market gain on the initial public offering of two of its investments during the current year period, as well as a bad debt expense and related legal provision in relation to an historical account receivable balance deemed uncollectible in the prior year period, partially offset by higher variable incentive costs in the current year due in part to allocating a larger portion of variable incentive costs from the segments to Corporate and Other activities in the current year.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nCorporate and Other EBIT decreased $123 million, or 50%, to a loss of $371 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss of $248 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to higher variable incentive costs associated with improved company profitability during 2020, $66 million in bad debt expense in relation to a disputed account receivable balance stemming from an historical account receivable balance deemed uncollectible, and positive mark-to-market results on one of our corporate venture capital unit investments in 2019, partially offset by non-recurring impairment charges and related employee severance costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters in 2019, and lower travel costs in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions.\nNon-core Segment\nSugar and Bioenergy Segment\n\n2021 Compared to 2020\nSegment EBIT increased $199 million, or 229%, to income of $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from a loss of $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is due to more favorable results from our investment in BP Bunge Bioenergia, driven by higher sugar and ethanol volumes and higher average sugar and ethanol sales prices in the current period, as well as a significant prior year foreign exchange loss on U.S. dollar denominated debt of the joint venture due to a large depreciation in the Brazilian real during 2020.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nSegment EBIT increased by $1,510 million, or 95% to a loss of $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss of $1,597 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to $1,673 million in non-recurring charges incurred in 2019 associated with the contribution of our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations, comprising the majority of our Sugar and Bioenergy segment, to the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nInterest-A summary of consolidated interest income and expense follows:\n\n2021 Compared to 2020\nInterest income increased $26 million to $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense decreased $22 million to $243 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $265 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower variable interest rates, as well as increased Interest income primarily driven by the positive resolution of an historical value-added tax matter, during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nInterest income decreased $9 million to $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense decreased $74 million to $265 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $339 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net decrease was the result of lower average interest rates on outstanding debt during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur main financial objectives are to prudently manage financial risks, ensure consistent access to liquidity and minimize cost of capital in order to efficiently finance our business and maintain balance sheet strength. We generally finance our ongoing operations with cash flows generated from operations, issuances of commercial paper, borrowings under various bilateral and syndicated revolving credit facilities, term loans and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. Acquisitions and long-lived assets are generally financed with a combination of equity and long-term debt.\nWorking Capital\n\n(1)Comprises Assets held for sale and Other current assets\n(2)Comprises Liabilities held for sale and Other current liabilities\n(3)Working capital is defined as Total current assets less Total current liabilities; Current ratio represents Total current assets divided by Total current liabilities\nWorking capital was $7,136 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $1,940 million, or 37%, from working capital of $5,196 million at December 31, 2020.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents were $902 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $550 million from $352 million at December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of improved operating results. Cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy, the objectives of which are to preserve the principal value of our cash assets, maintain a high degree of liquidity and deliver competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions. Cash balances are invested in short-term deposits with highly rated financial institutions and in U.S. government securities.\nTrade accounts receivable, net - Trade accounts receivable, net were $2,112 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $395 million from $1,717 million at December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to increased Net sales in the current year driven by factors described in the Segment Overview & Results of Operations section above.\nInventories - Inventories were $8,431 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $1,259 million from $7,172 million at December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily related to higher average commodity prices at the end of the current year relative to the prior year.\nRMI comprises agricultural commodity inventories, including soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, and wheat that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms. Total RMI reported at fair value were $6,869 million and $5,961 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively (see Note 5- Inventories, to our consolidated financial statements).\nOther current assets - Other current assets, including Assets held for sale, were $5,015 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1,925 million from $6,940 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to decreased unrealized gains on derivative contracts, lower margin deposits, and completion of the sale of our Rotterdam oils facility and United States\ninterior grain assets during the year ended December 31, 2021, which were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2020. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Deferred purchase price receivable (see Note 4- Trade Accounts Receivable and Trade Receivable Securitization Program, to our consolidated financial statements) as well as the reclassification of certain assets associated with our Mexico wheat milling business as held for sale during the current year (see Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions, to our consolidated financial statements).\nShort-term debt - Short-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, was $1,177 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1,659 million from $2,836 million at December 31, 2020. The lower short-term debt level at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 is primarily driven by a $1 billion long-term bond issuance in the second quarter of 2021 (see Note 18- Long-term Debt, to our consolidated financial statements), from which a portion of the proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt, in addition to increased cash from operations used to pay down debt in the current year.\nTrade accounts payable - Trade accounts payable were $4,250 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $1,614 million from $2,636 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in Trade accounts payable was primarily due to higher average inventory purchase prices during the current year as well as the timing of payments.\nOther current liabilities - Other current liabilities, including Liabilities held for sale, were $3,547 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1,731 million from $5,278 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to decreased unrealized losses on derivative contracts, the sale of our United States interior grain assets that were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2020, and a payment to acquire the noncontrolling equity interests in our Z.T. Kruszwica S.A. subsidiary in Europe during the year ended December 31, 2021 (see Note 13- Other Current Liabilities, to our consolidated financial statements). The Liabilities held for sale balance as of December 31, 2021 relates to the classification of our Mexico wheat milling business as held for sale during the current year (see Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions, to our consolidated financial statements).\nDebt\nFinancing Arrangements and Outstanding Indebtedness-We conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure that provides the company with efficient access to debt and capital markets. This structure includes a master trust, the primary assets of which comprise intercompany loans made to Bunge Limited and its subsidiaries. Certain of Bunge Limited's 100% owned finance subsidiaries, Bunge Limited Finance Corp., Bunge Finance Europe B.V. and Bunge Asset Funding Corp., fund the master trust with short and long-term debt obtained from third parties, including through our commercial paper program and certain credit facilities, as well as the issuance of senior notes. Borrowings by these finance subsidiaries carry full, unconditional guarantees by Bunge Limited.\nRevolving Credit Facilities-At December 31, 2021, we had $5,565 million of aggregate committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program and various revolving bilateral and syndicated credit facilities, all of which was unused and available. The following table summarizes these facilities for the years presented:\n ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following should be read in conjunction with \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating Results\nFactors Affecting Operating Results\nBunge Limited, a Bermuda company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global agribusiness and food company with integrated operations that stretch from farmer to consumer. The commodity nature of the Company's principal products, as well as regional and global supply and demand variations that occur as an inherent part of the business, make volumes an important operating measure. Accordingly, information is included in \"Segment Results\" that summarizes certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment. The common unit of measure for all reported volumes is metric tons. A description of reported volumes for each reportable segment has also been included in the discussion of key factors affecting results of operations in each of our business segments as discussed below.\nAgribusiness\nIn the Agribusiness segment, we purchase, store, transport, process and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products. Profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy, transportation, and logistics services. Profitability in our processing operations is also impacted by volumes procured, processed and sold and by capacity utilization rates. Availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors, including weather, farmer planting and selling decisions, plant diseases, governmental policies, and agricultural sector economic conditions. Reported volumes in this segment primarily reflect (i) grains and oilseeds originated from farmers, cooperatives or other aggregators and from which \"origination margins\" are earned; (ii) oilseeds processed in our oilseed processing facilities and from which \"crushing margins\" are earned, representing the margin from the industrial separation of the oilseed into its protein meal and vegetable oil components, both of which are separate commodity products; and (iii) third party sales of grains, oilseeds and related commodity products merchandised through our distribution businesses and from which \"distribution margins\" are earned. The foregoing subsegment volumes may overlap as they produce separate margin capture opportunities. For example, oilseeds procured in our South American grain origination activities may be processed in our oilseed processing facilities in Asia-Pacific and will be reflected at both points within the segment. As such, these reported volumes do not represent solely volumes of net sales to third-parties, but rather where margin is earned, appropriately reflecting their contribution to our global network's capacity utilization and profitability.\nDemand for our purchased and processed Agribusiness products is affected by many factors, including global and regional economic conditions, changes in per capita income, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, particularly pork and poultry, population growth rates, relative prices of substitute agricultural products, outbreaks of disease associated with livestock and poultry, and demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products.\nWe expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global supply and demand for our Agribusiness products for the foreseeable future. We also expect that, from time to time, imbalances will likely exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions, which impacts our decisions regarding whether, when and where to purchase, store, transport, process or sell these commodities, including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity.\nAdditionally, price fluctuations and availability of commodities may cause fluctuations in our working capital, such as inventories, accounts receivable and borrowings over the course of a given year. For example, increased availability of commodities at harvest times often causes fluctuations in our inventories and borrowings. Increases in agricultural commodity prices will also generally cause our cash flow requirements to increase as our operations require increased use of cash to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange-traded futures that we use to hedge our physical inventories.\nRefined and Specialty Oils\nIn the Refined and Specialty Oils segment, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials such as crude vegetable oils, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita income, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets. Raw material inputs to our production processes in the Refined and Specialty Oils segment are largely sourced at market prices from our Agribusiness segment. Reported volumes in this segment reflect third-party sales of our finished products and, as such, include the sales of products\nderived from raw materials sourced from the Agribusiness segment as well as from third-parties. The unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials, which are their primary inputs.\nMilling\nIn the Milling segment, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials such as grains, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita income, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets. Raw material inputs to our production processes in the Milling segment are largely sourced at market prices from our Agribusiness segment. Reported volumes in these segments reflect third-party sales of our finished products and, as such, include the sales of products derived from raw materials sourced from the Agribusiness segment as well as from third-parties. The unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials, which are their primary inputs.\nSugar and Bioenergy\nOur Sugar and Bioenergy segment primarily comprises our 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, the joint venture formed in December 2019 by the combination of our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations with the Brazilian biofuels business of BP. Until December 2019, our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations formed the majority of our Sugar and Bioenergy segment through which we produced and sold sugar and ethanol derived from sugarcane, as well as energy derived from the sugar and ethanol production process. BP Bunge Bioenergia operates on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North and Midwest regions of Brazil. Following the joint venture's formation we no longer consolidate our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations in our consolidated financial statements and instead account for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our reported Sugar and Bioenergy results for 2021 and 2020 include our share of the net earnings in BP Bunge Bioenergia, whereas our Sugar and Bioenergy results for 2019 reflect our former 100% ownership interest in the Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations contributed to the joint venture. Although we are committed to supporting the growth and development of BP Bunge Bioenergia, our long-term goal is to seek strategic opportunities for our investment in the joint venture.\nProfitability in this segment is affected by the profitability of the joint venture and, therefore the value of our investment and the amount and timing of distributions we receive, if any. In turn, the profitability of the joint venture is affected by the availability and quality of sugarcane, which impacts capacity utilization rates and the amount of sugar that can be extracted from the sugarcane, and by market prices of sugar and ethanol. The availability and quality of sugarcane is affected by many factors, including weather, geographical factors such as soil quality and topography, and agricultural practices. Once planted, sugarcane may be harvested for several continuous years, but the yield decreases with each subsequent harvest. As a result, the current optimum economic cycle is generally five to seven consecutive harvests, depending on location. The joint venture owns and/or has partnership agreements to manage farmland on which it grows and harvests sugarcane and also purchases sugarcane from third parties. Prices of sugarcane in Brazil are established by Consecana, the state of S\u00e3o Paulo sugarcane, sugar and ethanol council, and are based on the sucrose content of the cane and the market prices of sugar and ethanol. Demand for the joint venture's products is affected by such factors as changes in global or regional economic conditions, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, population growth rates, changes in per capita income and demand for and governmental support of renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities, including sugarcane.\nIn addition to these industry related factors which impact our business areas, our results of operations in all business areas and segments are affected by the following factors:\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nDue to the global nature of our operations, our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. Both translation of our foreign subsidiaries' financial statements and foreign currency transactions can affect our results. On a monthly basis, for subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar, subsidiary statements of income and cash flows must be translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted-average exchange rates in each monthly period. As a result, fluctuations of local currencies compared to the U.S. dollar during each monthly period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each reported period (per quarter and year-to-date) and also affect comparisons between those reported periods. Subsidiary balance sheets are translated using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nAdditionally, we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity. These amounts are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates as\nof the balance sheet date, with the resulting gains or losses included in the entity's statement of income and, therefore, in our consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net.\nWe primarily use a combination of equity and intercompany loans to finance our subsidiaries. Intercompany loans that are of a long-term investment nature with no intention of repayment in the foreseeable future are considered permanently invested and as such are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses on such permanently invested intercompany loans are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets. In contrast, foreign currency translation gains or losses on intercompany loans that are not of a permanent nature are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a Bermuda exempted company, we are not subject to income taxes in our jurisdiction of incorporation. However, our subsidiaries, which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions, are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from 0% to 35%. The jurisdictions that significantly impact our effective tax rate are Brazil, the United States, Argentina, Switzerland and Bermuda. Determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nTotal segment earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") is an operating performance measure used by Bunge's management to evaluate segment operating activities. Bunge also uses Core Segment EBIT, Non-core Segment EBIT and Total Segment EBIT to evaluate the operating performance of Bunge's Core reportable segments, Non-core reportable segments, and total reportable segments together with Corporate and Other. Core Segment EBIT is the aggregate of the EBIT of each of Bunge's Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments. Non-core Segment EBIT is the EBIT of Bunge's Sugar & Bioenergy segment. Total Segment EBIT is the aggregate of the EBIT of Bunge's Core and Non-core reportable segments, together with Corporate and Other. Bunge's management believes Core Segment EBIT, Non-core Segment EBIT and Total Segment EBIT are useful measures of operating profitability since the measures allow for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to financing methods or capital structure. In addition, EBIT is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in Bunge's industry. Total Segment EBIT is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Further, Total Segment EBIT excludes EBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests and is not a measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net income (loss) or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP. See the reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT below.\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities, adjusted is calculated by including the Net proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables with Cash provided by (used for) operating activities. Cash provided by (used for) operating activities, adjusted is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace Cash provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Our management believes presentation of this measure allows investors to view our cash generating performance using the same measure that management uses in evaluating financial and business performance and trends.\n2021 Overview\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Bunge - For the year ended December 31, 2021, Net income attributable to Bunge was $2,078 million, an increase of $933 million compared to a Net income attributable to Bunge of $1,145 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to higher Segment EBIT in our Core and Non-core segments, as further discussed in the Segment Overview and Results of Operations section below.\nEarnings Per Common Share - Diluted - For the year ended December 31, 2021, Net income attributable to Bunge common shareholders, diluted, was $13.64 per share, an increase of $5.93 per share, compared to $7.71 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEBIT - For the year ended December 31, 2021, Total Segment EBIT was $2,661 million, an increase of $1,028 million compared to EBIT of $1,633 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Total Segment EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to higher Segment EBIT in our Core and Non-core segments, as further discussed in the Segment Overview and Results of Operations section below, and which also provides a reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit - Income tax expense was $398 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to income tax expense of $248 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in income tax expense\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to higher pretax income, resulting from higher EBIT in our Core and Non-core segments, as noted above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - At December 31, 2021, working capital, which equals total current assets less total current liabilities, was $7,136 million, an increase of $1,940 million, compared to working capital of $5,196 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in working capital is primarily due to higher commodity prices, including related increases in readily marketable inventories (\"RMI\") purchases, and lower short-term debt levels driven by a $1 billion long-term bond issuance in the second quarter of 2021 (see Note 18- Long-term Debt, to our consolidated financial statements), from which a portion of the proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt.\nSegment Overview and Results of Operations\nEffective January 1, 2021, we changed our reporting segments to align with our new value chain operational structure, as discussed in Note 28- Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements. Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts within the reporting segments have been made to conform to current presentation.\nOur operations are now organized, managed and classified into four reportable segments, organized based upon their similar economic characteristics, nature of products and services offered, production processes, types and classes of customer, and distribution methods. We further organize these reportable segments into Core operations and Non-core operations. Core operations comprise our Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments. Non-core operations comprise our Sugar & Bioenergy segment, which itself primarily comprises our 50% interest in the net earnings of BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture with BP p.l.c. (\"BP\").\nOur remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Corporate and Other. Corporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to our individual reporting segments because the operating performance of each reporting segment is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance program, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities.\nA reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT follows:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,280) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>(48) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests' share of interest and tax </td> <td> </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(891) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agribusiness Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>2,290 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>737 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Refined and Specialty Oils Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Milling Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>(74) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>2,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>954 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>(333) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(371) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(248) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sugar and Bioenergy Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,597) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-core Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,597) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(891) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCore Segments\nAgribusiness Segment\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes (in thousand metric tons) </td> <td> </td> <td>142,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139,158 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,920 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,133) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,185) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,765) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>2,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,155 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(432) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(520) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(490) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange (losses) gains -

The increase was due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, Net sales increased $7,125 million primarily due to significantly higher average sales prices in our soybean processing businesses in all regions, driven by higher commodity prices, and significantly higher average sales prices in our European softseed processing business. The above increases were partially offset by slightly lower volumes in most key regions.\n\u2022In Merchandising, Net sales increased $6,464 million due to significantly higher average sales prices, primarily in our global corn, global oil and global wheat businesses, driven by higher commodity prices, and higher sales in our ocean freight business driven by increased global freight demand and related sales prices.\nCost of goods sold increased by $12,948 million, or 46%, to $41,133 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $28,185 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, Cost of goods sold increased by $6,492 million due to higher global commodity prices and related sales as noted above, as well as increased industrial input costs driven by inflation, in particular energy, partially offset by favorable mark-to-market results in our global soybean processing businesses.\n\u2022In Merchandising, Cost of goods sold increased by $6,456 million due to higher global commodity prices and related sales as noted above, as well as increased industrial input costs driven by inflation, in particular energy, and unfavorable mark-to-market results, primarily in our ocean freight business.\nGross profit increased by $641 million, or 34%, to $2,503 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,862 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, an increase of $633 million was due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, as a result of strong oil and meal demand leading to higher sales prices, coupled with favorable mark-to-market results, as described above.\n\u2022In Merchandising, an increase of $8 million was due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, as higher average sales prices were partially offset by unfavorable mark-to-market results, as described above.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses decreased $88 million, or 17%, to $432 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $520 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a higher portion of variable incentive costs being allocated to Corporate and Other activities in the current year, as well as favorable currency movements, primarily from the weakening of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real.\nForeign exchange gains (losses) - net decreased $174 million, to a loss of $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a gain of $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Foreign exchange results were primarily driven by losses on U.S. dollar denominated loans payable in non-U.S. functional currency operations.\nOther income (expenses) - net increased $173 million, to income of $215 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to income of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to a $158 million gain resulting from the sale of certain interior grain elevators located in the United States during 2021.\nSegment EBIT increased $730 million, or 47%, to $2,290 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,560 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, an increase of $558 million was primarily due to higher Gross profit, lower SG&A and higher Other income (expense) - net, partially offset by foreign exchange losses, as described above.\n\u2022In Merchandising, an increase of $172 million was primarily due to higher Gross profit, lower SG&A and higher Other income (expense) - net, partially offset by foreign exchange losses, as described above.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nAgribusiness segment Net sales increased by $1,127 million, or 4%, to $30,047 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $28,920 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, Net sales increased $638 million principally due to higher sales volumes in our South American, North American, and European and Asian soybean processing businesses, primarily driven by increased meal demand in China and increased oil demand in North America, as well as higher volumes and prices in our Canadian and European softseed processing businesses, driven by demand for renewable diesel.\n\u2022In Merchandising, Net sales increased $489 million primarily due to higher average sales prices and volumes in our global corn and global oil businesses, driven by increased demand in China following an easing of trade restrictions in place for much of 2019, as well as higher volumes in Brazil driven by increased farmer selling in response to depreciation of Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar earlier in the year. The above increases were partially offset by lower volumes in our global wheat business.\nCost of goods sold increased by $420 million, or 2%, to $28,185 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $27,765 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, Cost of goods sold increased by $195 million due to higher sales activity, as described above, as well as unfavorable mark-to-market results in our processing businesses, partially offset by favorable translation impacts on industrial costs as most currencies in which such expenses are denominated depreciated versus the U.S. dollar during 2020, as well as non-recurring prior year property, plant and equipment (PP&E) impairment charges at various facilities associated with portfolio rationalization initiatives.\n\u2022In Merchandising, Cost of goods sold increased by $225 million due to the higher sales activity noted above, partially offset by favorable mark-to-market results and translation impacts on industrial costs as most currencies in which such expenses are denominated depreciated versus the U.S. dollar during 2020, as well as non-recurring prior year PP&E impairment charges at various facilities associated with portfolio rationalization initiatives.\nGross profit increased by $707 million, or 61%, to $1,862 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,155 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, an increase of $443 million was due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, primarily driven by strong demand in our soybean processing businesses across all regions, as described above.\n\u2022In Merchandising, an increase of $264 million was due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, primarily driven by strong demand in our global corn and global oil businesses, as described above.\nSG&A expenses increased $30 million, or 6%, to $520 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $490 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly due to higher variable incentive costs on the back of improved overall company profitability, partially offset by savings associated with ongoing cost initiatives, lower expenses due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, favorable translation impacts as most currencies in which SG&A expenses are\ndenominated depreciated versus the U.S. dollar during 2020, and an $11 million prior year write-off of an indemnification asset associated with the reversal of an uncertain tax position.\nForeign exchange gains (losses) - net increased $186 million, to a gain of $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss of $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Foreign exchange results were primarily driven by gains on U.S. dollar denominated loans receivable in non-U.S. functional currency operations.\nOther income (expenses) - net decreased $23 million, to income of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to income of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower results from our financial services activities during 2020.\nSegment EBIT increased $823 million, or 112%, to $1,560 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $737 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022In Processing, an increase of $543 million was primarily due to higher Gross profit and increased foreign exchange results, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses, as described above.\n\u2022In Merchandising, an increase of $280 million was primarily due to higher Gross profit and increased foreign exchange results, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses, as described above.\nRefined and Specialty Oils Segment\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes (in thousand metric tons) </td> <td> </td> <td>9,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,632 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,193 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,476) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,859) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,582) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>611 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(355) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(391) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(375) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange losses - net </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests </td> <td> </td> <td>(73) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense) - net </td> <td> </td> <td>239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(121) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Refined and Specialty Oils Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2021 Compared to 2020\nRefined and Specialty Oils segment Net sales increased by $3,733 million, or 39%, to $13,332 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $9,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to significantly higher average selling prices in North America, Europe and Asia, driven by strong demand for renewable diesel and in food services. The above increases were partially offset by lower overall volumes, driven by our South American operations due to stay-at-home orders associated with COVID-19 earlier in the current year, as well as the sale of our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise assets in late 2020.\nCost of goods sold increased by $3,617 million, or 41%, to $12,476 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $8,859 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Cost of goods sold was due to higher raw material commodity prices as discussed above, higher industrial input costs, in particular energy, and a $50 million impairment charge, which includes $15 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, recorded in relation to an oils facility in China. These increases were partially offset by lower overall volumes as described in Net sales above.\nGross profit increased by $116 million, or 16%, to $856 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $740 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to the increase in Net sales in excess of the increase in Cost of goods sold, primarily driven by strong demand for renewable diesel and in food services, as described above.\nSG&A expenses decreased $36 million, or 9%, to $355 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $391 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher bad debt expense recorded in the prior year,\nfavorable currency movements, primarily from the weakening of the Brazilian real, and the allocation of a higher portion of variable incentive costs to Corporate and Other activities in the current year.\nEBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests, an expense when subsidiaries with noncontrolling interests generate earnings before interest and tax, versus income when subsidiaries with noncontrolling interests generate loss before interest and tax, decreased by $71 million, to expense of $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to expense of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The expense for the current year is primarily due to improved results in Bunge Loders Croklaan, including the noncontrolling interest share of the gain on sale of our Rotterdam oils refinery, partially offset by the noncontrolling interest share of an impairment charge on an oils facility in China.\nOther income (expenses) - net increased $144 million to income of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to income of $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Current period income was primarily due to a $219 million gain, which includes the amount attributable to noncontrolling interests, resulting on the sale of our Rotterdam oils refinery, as well as a $19 million gain on the sale of a Mexican oils packaging facility. Prior period income was due to a gain on the sale of our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise assets, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nSegment EBIT increased by $226 million, or 51%, to $666 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $440 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher Gross profit and Other income (expenses) - net, and lower SG&A, partially offset by higher EBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests, as described above.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nRefined and Specialty Oils segment Net sales increased by $406 million, or 4%, to $9,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $9,193 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to higher average selling prices in all regions, and higher sales volumes to food processor customers driven by increased at-home consumption associated with COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, partially offset by lower food services volumes, again due to COVID-19. The year ended December 31, 2020 also benefited from $47 million of indirect tax credits related to the favorable resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax claim.\nCost of goods sold increased by $277 million, or 3%, to $8,859 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $8,582 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in Cost of goods sold was due to higher Net sales, partially offset by favorable translation impacts, unfavorable mark-to-market results in 2019, and approximately $40 million of non-recurring PP&E impairment charges at various facilities associated with portfolio rationalization initiatives during 2019.\nGross profit increased by $129 million, or 21%, to $740 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $611 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher Net sales in excess of higher Cost of goods sold, primarily related to food processor margin expansion resulting from increased at-home consumption associated with COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, as described above.\nSG&A expenses increased $16 million, or 4%, to $391 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $375 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher variable incentive costs on the back of improved overall company profitability and increased bad debt expense, partially offset by favorable translation impacts and lower travel costs associated with COVID-19 travel restrictions.\nOther income (expenses) - net increased $216 million, or 179%, to income of $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to expense of $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to a gain on the sale of our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise assets, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2020, and a 2019 goodwill impairment charge of $108 million, which includes $32 million attributable to noncontrolling interests associated with our Bunge Loders Croklaan joint venture.\nSegment EBIT increased by $319 million, or 264%, to $440 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The increase was primarily due to higher volumes and average sales prices in our South American and Mexican wheat milling businesses and higher average sales prices in our North American corn milling business, partially offset by lower volumes in North America due to the sale of our rice milling business in the prior year.\nCost of goods sold increased by $455 million, or 32%, to $1,882 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,427 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the increased sales activity noted above, higher industrial costs, in particular energy, and a non-recurring impairment charge of $170 million related to the classification of our Mexican wheat milling business as held-for-sale, as described further in Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes in North America resulting from the prior year sale of our rice business and favorable current year mark-to-market results.\nGross profit decreased by $162 million, or 86%, to $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $189 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in Cost of goods sold in excess of the increase in Net sales, mostly due to a non-recurring impairment charge of $170 million related to the classification of our Mexican wheat milling business as held-for-sale, as described above.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $4 million, or 4%, to $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a higher portion of variable incentive costs being allocated to Corporate and Other.\nSegment EBIT decreased by $165 million, or 181%, to a loss before interest and taxes of $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to earnings before interest and taxes of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower Gross profit, mostly driven by a non-recurring impairment charge of $170 million related to the classification of our Mexican wheat milling business as held-for-sale, as described above.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nMilling segment Net sales decreased by $123 million, or 7%, to $1,616 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,739 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower average sales prices in Brazil and Mexico, and lower sales prices in our U.S. corn milling business, which more than offset higher volumes.\nCost of goods sold decreased by $128 million, or 8%, to $1,427 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,555 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to lower Net sales, as described above, favorable translation impacts on industrial costs following depreciation of the Brazilian real and Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar in 2020, and approximately $28 million of non-recurring impairment charges associated with our U.S. extrusion business and portfolio rationalization initiatives in 2019.\nGross profit increased by $5 million, or 3%, to $189 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to a decrease in Cost of goods sold in excess of the decrease in Net sales, as described above.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $14 million, or 12%, to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $114 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as favorable translation impacts and lower travel costs associated with COVID-19 restrictions were partially offset by higher variable compensation costs associated with improved company profitability.\nOther income (expenses) - net decreased $23 million, to expense of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to income of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to a $19 million gain on the sale of two facilities in Brazil during 2019.\nSegment EBIT decreased $5 million, or 5%, to $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower Other income (expense) - net, partially offset by lower SG&A and higher Gross profit, as described above.\nCorporate and Other\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>(34) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>(29) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(350) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(347) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(335) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange (losses) gains - net </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense) - net </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from affiliates </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Corporate and Other EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(333) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(371) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(248) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2021 Compared to 2020\nCorporate and Other EBIT improved $38 million, or 10%, to a loss of $333 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a loss of $371 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The improved result is primarily due to our corporate venture capital unit (Bunge Ventures) activities, which benefited from a net mark-to-market gain on the initial public offering of two of its investments during the current year period, as well as a bad debt expense and related legal provision in relation to an historical account receivable balance deemed uncollectible in the prior year period, partially offset by higher variable incentive costs in the current year due in part to allocating a larger portion of variable incentive costs from the segments to Corporate and Other activities in the current year.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nCorporate and Other EBIT decreased $123 million, or 50%, to a loss of $371 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss of $248 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to higher variable incentive costs associated with improved company profitability during 2020, $66 million in bad debt expense in relation to a disputed account receivable balance stemming from an historical account receivable balance deemed uncollectible, and positive mark-to-market results on one of our corporate venture capital unit investments in 2019, partially offset by non-recurring impairment charges and related employee severance costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters in 2019, and lower travel costs in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions.\nNon-core Segment\nSugar and Bioenergy Segment\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes (in thousand metric tons) </td> <td> </td> <td>375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,836 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>(264) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(139) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,692) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,404) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange losses - net </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(89) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense) - net </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from affiliates </td> <td> </td> <td>106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Sugar and Bioenergy Segment EBIT </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,597) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2021 Compared to 2020\nSegment EBIT increased $199 million, or 229%, to income of $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from a loss of $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is due to more favorable results from our investment in BP Bunge Bioenergia, driven by higher sugar and ethanol volumes and higher average sugar and ethanol sales prices in the current period, as well as a significant prior year foreign exchange loss on U.S. dollar denominated debt of the joint venture due to a large depreciation in the Brazilian real during 2020.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nSegment EBIT increased by $1,510 million, or 95% to a loss of $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss of $1,597 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to $1,673 million in non-recurring charges incurred in 2019 associated with the contribution of our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations, comprising the majority of our Sugar and Bioenergy segment, to the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nInterest-A summary of consolidated interest income and expense follows:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(US$ in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(243) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(265) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(339) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2021 Compared to 2020\nInterest income increased $26 million to $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense decreased $22 million to $243 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $265 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower variable interest rates, as well as increased Interest income primarily driven by the positive resolution of an historical value-added tax matter, during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nInterest income decreased $9 million to $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense decreased $74 million to $265 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $339 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net decrease was the result of lower average interest rates on outstanding debt during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur main financial objectives are to prudently manage financial risks, ensure consistent access to liquidity and minimize cost of capital in order to efficiently finance our business and maintain balance sheet strength. We generally finance our ongoing operations with cash flows generated from operations, issuances of commercial paper, borrowings under various bilateral and syndicated revolving credit facilities, term loans and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. Acquisitions and long-lived assets are generally financed with a combination of equity and long-term debt.\nWorking Capital\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>US$ in millions, except current ratio </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade accounts receivable, net </td> <td>2,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,717 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories </td> <td>8,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,172 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current assets(1)\n</td> <td>5,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,940 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,181 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,828 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term debt </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade accounts payable </td> <td>4,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,636 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current operating lease obligations </td> <td>350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>235 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current liabilities(2)\n</td> <td>3,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,278 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current liabilities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,985 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital(3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,196 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current ratio(3)\n</td> <td>1.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Comprises Assets held for sale and Other current assets\n(2)Comprises Liabilities held for sale and Other current liabilities\n(3)Working capital is defined as Total current assets less Total current liabilities; Current ratio represents Total current assets divided by Total current liabilities\nWorking capital was $7,136 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $1,940 million, or 37%, from working capital of $5,196 million at December 31, 2020.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents were $902 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $550 million from $352 million at December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of improved operating results. Cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy, the objectives of which are to preserve the principal value of our cash assets, maintain a high degree of liquidity and deliver competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions. Cash balances are invested in short-term deposits with highly rated financial institutions and in U.S. government securities.\nTrade accounts receivable, net - Trade accounts receivable, net were $2,112 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $395 million from $1,717 million at December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to increased Net sales in the current year driven by factors described in the Segment Overview & Results of Operations section above.\nInventories - Inventories were $8,431 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $1,259 million from $7,172 million at December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily related to higher average commodity prices at the end of the current year relative to the prior year.\nRMI comprises agricultural commodity inventories, including soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, and wheat that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms. Total RMI reported at fair value were $6,869 million and $5,961 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively (see Note 5- Inventories, to our consolidated financial statements).\nOther current assets - Other current assets, including Assets held for sale, were $5,015 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1,925 million from $6,940 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to decreased unrealized gains on derivative contracts, lower margin deposits, and completion of the sale of our Rotterdam oils facility and United States\ninterior grain assets during the year ended December 31, 2021, which were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2020. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Deferred purchase price receivable (see Note 4- Trade Accounts Receivable and Trade Receivable Securitization Program, to our consolidated financial statements) as well as the reclassification of certain assets associated with our Mexico wheat milling business as held for sale during the current year (see Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions, to our consolidated financial statements).\nShort-term debt - Short-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, was $1,177 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1,659 million from $2,836 million at December 31, 2020. The lower short-term debt level at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 is primarily driven by a $1 billion long-term bond issuance in the second quarter of 2021 (see Note 18- Long-term Debt, to our consolidated financial statements), from which a portion of the proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt, in addition to increased cash from operations used to pay down debt in the current year.\nTrade accounts payable - Trade accounts payable were $4,250 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $1,614 million from $2,636 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in Trade accounts payable was primarily due to higher average inventory purchase prices during the current year as well as the timing of payments.\nOther current liabilities - Other current liabilities, including Liabilities held for sale, were $3,547 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1,731 million from $5,278 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to decreased unrealized losses on derivative contracts, the sale of our United States interior grain assets that were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2020, and a payment to acquire the noncontrolling equity interests in our Z.T. Kruszwica S.A. subsidiary in Europe during the year ended December 31, 2021 (see Note 13- Other Current Liabilities, to our consolidated financial statements). The Liabilities held for sale balance as of December 31, 2021 relates to the classification of our Mexico wheat milling business as held for sale during the current year (see Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions, to our consolidated financial statements).\nDebt\nFinancing Arrangements and Outstanding Indebtedness-We conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure that provides the company with efficient access to debt and capital markets. This structure includes a master trust, the primary assets of which comprise intercompany loans made to Bunge Limited and its subsidiaries. Certain of Bunge Limited's 100% owned finance subsidiaries, Bunge Limited Finance Corp., Bunge Finance Europe B.V. and Bunge Asset Funding Corp., fund the master trust with short and long-term debt obtained from third parties, including through our commercial paper program and certain credit facilities, as well as the issuance of senior notes. Borrowings by these finance subsidiaries carry full, unconditional guarantees by Bunge Limited.\nRevolving Credit Facilities-At December 31, 2021, we had $5,565 million of aggregate committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program and various revolving bilateral and syndicated credit facilities, all of which was unused and available. The following table summarizes these facilities for the years presented:\n "}
