Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nOur business model continues to be client-focused, utilizing relationship teams to provide our clients with a specific banker contact and support team responsible for all of their banking needs. The purpose of this structure is to provide a consistent and superior level of professional service, and we believe it provides us with a distinct competitive advantage. We consider exceptional client service to be a critical part of our culture, which we refer to as \"ClientFIRST.\"\nAt December 31, 2017, we had total assets of $1.62 billion, a 21.2% increase from total assets of $1.34 billion at December 31, 2016. The largest components of our total assets are loans and securities which were $1.39 billion and $72.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. Comparatively, our loans and securities totaled $1.16 billion and $70.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Our liabilities and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017 totaled $1.47 billion and $149.7 million, respectively, compared to liabilities of $1.23 billion and shareholders' equity of $109.9 million at December 31, 2016. The principal component of our liabilities is deposits which were $1.38 billion and $1.09 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLike most community banks, we derive the majority of our income from interest received on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the difference between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, which is called our net interest spread. In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other charges to our clients.\nOur net income available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $13.0 million, or diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) of $1.76 and $1.94 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. While our net income remained consistent from the prior year, net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a $2.4 million expense due to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset resulting from the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in December 2017. In addition, our net income available to stockholders increased by $2.9 million, or 28.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEconomic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government significantly affect most financial institutions, including the Bank. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as client preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in our market areas.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWe have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies.\nThe judgment and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions we make, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. Management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and has discussed these policies with the Company's Audit Committee.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan loss is management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nWe have an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that assesses the losses inherent in our portfolio. While we attribute portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Our process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristics of our commercial and consumer loan portfolio segments. For each portfolio segment, impairment is measured individually for each impaired loan. Our allowance levels are influenced by loan volume, loan grade or delinquency status, historic loss experience and other economic conditions.\nThe allowance consists of general and specific components.\nCommercial loans are assessed for estimated losses by grading each loan using various risk factors identified through periodic reviews. We apply historic grade-specific loss factors to each loan class. In the development of our statistically derived loan grade loss factors, we observe historical losses over 20 quarters for each loan grade. These loss estimates are adjusted as appropriate based on additional analysis of external loss data or other risks identified from current economic conditions and credit quality trends. For consumer loans, we determine the allowance on a collective basis utilizing historical losses over 20 quarters to represent our best estimate of inherent loss. We pool loans, generally by loan class with similar risk characteristics.\nIncluded in the general component of the allowance for loan losses for both portfolio segments is a margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating general losses in the portfolio. Uncertainties and subjective issues such as changes in the lending policies and procedures, changes in the local/national economy, changes in volume or type of credits, changes in volume/severity or problem loans, quality of loan review and board of director oversight, concentrations of credit, and peer group comparisons are qualitative and environmental factors considered.\nThe specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the value of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and consumer loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The specific component also includes an amount for the estimated impairment on commercial and consumer loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d), whether on accrual or nonaccrual status.\nWhile management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in local economic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are used in relation to our mortgage banking activities and require significant judgment and estimates in determining their fair value. We hold derivative instruments, which consist of rate lock agreements related to expected funding of fixed-rate mortgage loans to customers ( interest rate lock commitments\u201d) and forward commitments to sell mortgage-backed securities and individual fixed-rate mortgage loans ( forward commitments\u201d). Our objective in obtaining the forward commitments is to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the interest rate lock commitments and the mortgage loans that are held for sale. Derivatives related to these commitments are recorded as either a derivative asset or a derivative liability in the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. Both the interest rate lock commitments and the forward commitments are reported at fair value, with adjustments recorded in current period earnings in mortgage banking within the noninterest income section of the consolidated statements of income.\nFair Valuation of Financial Instruments\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Additionally, we may be required to record other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Further, we include in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the valuation methodologies used, and the related impact to income. Additionally, for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, we disclose the estimate of their fair value.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Accounting standards establish a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. The three levels of inputs that are used to classify fair value measurements are as follows:\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Level 1 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 1 instruments generally include securities traded on active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange, as well as securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets. Instruments we classify as Level 1 are instruments that have been priced directly from dealer trading desks and represent actual prices at which such securities have traded within active markets.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Level 2 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques, such as matrix pricing, for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Instruments we classify as Level 2 include securities that are valued based on pricing models that use relevant observable information generated by transactions that have occurred in the market place that involve similar securities.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Level 3 - Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company's estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe attempt to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. When available, we use quoted market prices to measure fair value. Specifically, we use independent pricing services to obtain fair values based on quoted prices. Quoted prices are subject to our internal price verification procedures. If market prices are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that use primarily market-based or independently-sourced market parameters. Most of our financial instruments use either of the foregoing methodologies, collectively Level 1 and Level 2 measurements, to determine fair value adjustments recorded to our financial statements. However, in certain cases, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument.\nThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of an instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value.\nWhen observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management's judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. When significant adjustments are required to available observable inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs. When an active market for a security does not exist, the use of management estimates that incorporate current market participant expectations of future cash flows, and include appropriate risk premiums, is acceptable.\nSignificant judgment may be required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are included in Level 2 or Level 3. If fair value measurement is based upon recent observable market activity of such assets or comparable assets (other than forced or distressed transactions) that occur in sufficient volume and do not require significant adjustment using unobservable inputs, those assets are classified as Level 2. If not, they are classified as Level 3. Making this assessment requires significant judgment.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis\nOur debt securities are classified as securities available for sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, after applicable taxes, are reported in shareholders' equity. We conduct other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) analysis on a quarterly basis or more often if a potential loss-triggering event occurs. The initial indicator of OTTI for debt securities is a decline in market value below the amount recorded for an investment and the severity and duration of the decline. For a debt security for which there has been a decline in the fair value below amortized cost basis, we recognize OTTI if we (1) have the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nReal estate acquired through foreclosure is initially recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less selling costs. Subsequent to the date of acquisition, it is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, adjusted for net selling costs. Fair values of real estate owned are reviewed regularly and write-downs are recorded when it is determined that the carrying value of real estate exceeds the fair value less estimated costs to sell. Costs relating to the development and improvement of such property are capitalized, whereas those costs relating to holding the property are expensed.\nIncome Taxes\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis. When income and expenses are recognized in different periods for financial reporting purposes versus for the purposes of computing income taxes currently payable, deferred taxes are provided on such temporary differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions taken or expected to be taken on its tax returns will more likely than not be sustained upon audit by the taxing authorities and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. The Company has recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possible materially, due to among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax act. The accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nOur level of net interest income is determined by the level of earning assets and the management of our net interest margin. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our net interest income was $50.9 million, $43.0 million, and $38.5 million, respectively. The $7.9 million, or 18.3%, increase in net interest income during 2017 was driven by a $238.3 million increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a $167.3 million increase in our average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in average earning assets is primarily related to an increase in average loans, while the increase in average interest-bearing liabilities is driven by an increase in interest-bearing deposits. During 2016, our net interest income increased $4.5 million, or 11.6%, while average interest-earning assets increased $125.6 million and average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $75.8 million.\nInterest income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $61.2 million, $51.2 million, and $46.0 million, respectively. A significant portion of our interest income relates to our strategy to maintain a large portion of our assets in higher earning loans compared to lower yielding investments and federal funds sold. As such, 96.1% of our interest income related to interest on loans during 2017, 96.3% during 2016 and 96.3% during 2015. Also, included in interest income on loans was $950,000, $816,000 and $1.1 million related to the net amortization of loan fees and capitalized loan origination costs for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest expense was $10.3 million, $8.2 million, and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Interest expense on deposits for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 represented 71.4%, 48.1%, and 47.8% of total interest expense, respectively, while interest expense on borrowings represented 28.6%, 51.9%, and 52.2% of total interest expense, respectively. The increase in interest expense on deposits during 2017 occurred as a result of a $290.0 million increase in our deposit balances which assisted in replacing $48.0 million of FHLB advances and other borrowings, as they matured during the year.\nWe have included a number of tables to assist in our description of various measures of our financial performance. For example, the Average Balances, Income and Expenses, Yields and Rates\u201d table shows the average balance of each category of our assets and liabilities as well as the yield we earned or the rate we paid with respect to each category during 2017, 2016, and 2015. Similarly, the Rate/Volume Analysis\u201d table demonstrates the effect of changing interest rates and changing volume of assets and liabilities on our financial condition during the periods shown. We also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates, and we have included tables to illustrate our interest rate sensitivity with respect to interest-earning and interest-bearing accounts.\nThe following table sets forth information related to our average balance sheet, average yields on assets, and average costs of liabilities at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. We derived these yields or costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. We derived average balances from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated. During the same periods, we had no securities purchased with agreements to resell. All investments were owned at an original maturity of over one year. Nonaccrual loans are included in earning assets in the following tables. Loan yields have been reduced to reflect the negative impact on our earnings of loans on nonaccrual status. The net of capitalized loan costs and fees are amortized into interest income on loans.\nAverage Balances, Income and Expenses, Yields and Rates\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The main driver of the six basis point decrease in net interest margin during the 2017 period was a 24 basis point increase in the cost of our interest-bearing deposits, primarily money market and time deposits. During 2016, our net interest margin remained consistent when compared to the year ended 2015, although the yield on our interest earning assets declined by two basis points, driven by a seven basis point decline in loan yield. In addition, the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities increased one basis point during the 2016 period due primarily to an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings.\nOur average interest-earning assets increased by $238.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, while the related yield on our interest-earning assets decreased by two basis points. The increase in average interest earning assets was driven by a $205.4 million increase in average loan balances during 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, our average federal funds sold balances increased by $38.6 million during the 2017 period while our average investment balances decreased by $5.6 million. The two basis point decline in yield during the 2017 period was driven by the increase in average federal funds sold at yields much lower than the remainder of our interest earning assets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our average interest-earning assets increased by $125.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, while the yield on our interest-earning assets decreased by two basis points during the 2016 period. Our average loan balances increased by $124.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015, while our loan yield decreased by seven basis points during the same period. In addition, our average federal funds sold balances decreased by $16.0 million during the 2016 period. The decline in the yield on our interest-earning assets during 2016 was driven primarily by reduced yields on our loan portfolio, combined with a higher level of federal funds sold which have a lower yield than the rest of our interest-earning assets.\nOur average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $167.3 million during 2017 as compared to 2016, while the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by six basis points. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was driven by a $201.7 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits during the 2017 period, while the cost related to our deposits increased 24 basis points when compared with the prior year. In addition, our average FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased by $34.4 million during the year, partially offsetting the increase in cost of our interest-bearing deposits as these borrowings were at rates much higher than those of our interest-bearing deposits. During 2016, our average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $75.8 million as compared to 2015, while the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by one basis point during the 2016 period.\nOur net interest spread was 3.35% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.43% for the same period in 2016 and 3.46% for 2015. The net interest spread is the difference between the yield we earn on our interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. The two basis point reduction in yield on our interest-earning assets and the six basis point increase in the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, resulted in an eight basis point decrease in our net interest spread for the 2017 period.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nNet interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume. The following tables set forth the effect which the varying levels of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the applicable rates have had on changes in net interest income for

component of our income, was $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $7.9 million increase from net interest income of $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income is due to a $10.0 million increase in interest income partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in interest expense. During 2017, our average interest-earning assets increased $238.3 million as compared to 2016, resulting in $9.5 million of additional interest income, while higher rates on our interest-earning assets also increased interest income by $316,000 from the prior year. Overall, our average interest-bearing deposits increased by $201.7 million while our average FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased by $34.4 million. While the growth in interest-bearing deposits resulted in additional interest expense, the reduction in FHLB advances and other borrowings reduced our interest expense, resulting in a net decrease in interest expense of $483,000. However, higher rates on all of our interest-bearing liabilities increased interest expense by $2.2 million from the prior year.\nDuring 2016, our average interest-earning assets increased $125.6 million as compared to 2015, resulting in $5.9 million of additional interest income; however, lower rates on our interest-earning assets reduced interest income by $616,000 from the prior year. In addition, interest-bearing liabilities increased by $75.8 million during 2016, resulting in $444,000 of additional interest expense. In addition, higher rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increased interest expense by $259,000 from the prior year.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe have established an allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses charged as an expense on our statements of income. We review our loan portfolio periodically to evaluate our outstanding loans and to measure both the performance of the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Please see the discussion below under Results of Operations - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for a description of the factors we consider in determining the amount of the provision we expense each period to maintain this allowance.\nFollowing is a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses.\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance, beginning of period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,752 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan charge-offs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,638 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,648 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,508 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan recoveries </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loan charge-offs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,332 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,074 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,323 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance, end of period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,629 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a noncash expense related to the provision for loan losses of $2.0 million, bringing the allowance for loan losses to $15.5 million, or 1.12% of gross loans, as of December 31, 2017. In comparison, we added $2.3 million and $3.2 million to the provision for loan losses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting in an allowance for loan losses of $14.9 million, or 1.28% of gross loans, as of December 31, 2016, and an allowance for loan losses of $13.6 million, or 1.36% of gross loans, as of December 31, 2015. The lesser provision expense of $2.0 million during 2017 relates primarily to the continued improvement in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our net charge-offs were $1.3 million, representing 0.10% of average loans, and consisted of $1.6 million in loans charged-off, partially offset by $306,000 of recoveries on loans previously charged-off. In addition, nonperforming assets remained at 0.46% of total assets while our level of classified assets declined to 9.7% at December 31, 2017 from 13.2% at December 31, 2016. Factors such as these are also considered in determining the amount of loan loss provision necessary to maintain our allowance for loan losses at an adequate level. The continued improvement in these credit quality factors is the primary driver of the reduction in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of our total loans.\nWe reported net charge-offs of $1.1 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, including recoveries of $574,000 and $185,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net charge-offs of $1.1 million and $1.3 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively, represented 0.10% and 0.14% of the average outstanding loan portfolios for the respective years.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following tables set forth information related to our noninterest income.\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mortgage banking income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,152 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,837 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,963 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Service fees on deposit accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,168 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,002 </td> <td> </td> <td>893 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income from bank owned life insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>811 </td> <td> </td> <td>736 </td> <td> </td> <td>685 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sale of investment securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td>431 </td> <td> </td> <td>297 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,202 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,840 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,578 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,337 </td> <td> </td> <td>10,846 </td> <td> </td> <td>8,416 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income was $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $1.5 million, or 13.9%, decrease compared to noninterest income of $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The efficiency ratio represents the percentage of one dollar of expense required to be incurred to earn a full dollar of revenue and is computed by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. The slightly improved efficiency ratio during 2017 relates primarily to the increase in net interest income due to significant loan growth and increased loan yields.\nIncome tax expense was $10.6 million, $7.3 million and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Average loans for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Before allowance for loan losses, total loans outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.\nThe principal component of our loan portfolio is loans secured by real estate mortgages. As of December 31, 2017, our loan portfolio included $1.1 billion, or 82.1%, of real estate loans. As of December 31, 2016, loans secured by real estate made up 81.1% of our loan portfolio and totaled $943.5 million. Most of our real estate loans are secured by residential or commercial property. We obtain a security interest in real estate, in addition to any other available collateral. This collateral is taken to increase the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan. Generally, we limit the loan-to-value ratio on loans to coincide with the appropriate regulatory guidelines. We attempt to maintain a relatively diversified loan portfolio to help reduce the risk inherent in concentration in certain types of collateral and business types. We do not generally originate traditional long term residential mortgages to hold in our loan portfolio, but we do issue traditional second mortgage residential real estate loans and home equity lines of credit. Home equity lines of credit totaled $156.1 million as of December 31, 2017, of which approximately 40% were in a first lien position, while the remaining balance was second liens, compared to $137.1 million as of December 31, 2016, of which approximately 39% were in first lien positions and the remaining balance was in second liens. The average loan had a balance of approximately $89,000 and a loan to value of approximately 71% as of December 31, 2017, compared to an average loan balance of $91,000 and a loan to value of approximately 73% as of December 31, 2016. Further, 0.8% and 0.3% of our total home equity lines of credit were over 30 days past due as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFollowing is a summary of our loan composition for each of the five years ended December 31, 2017. Of the $223.4 million in loan growth in 2017, $77.9 million of growth was in consumer related loans, while $145.5 million of growth was in commercial related loans. In addition, the $72.9 million increase in consumer real estate loans is related to our focus to continue to originate high quality 1-4 family consumer real estate loans. Our average consumer real estate loan currently has a principal balance of $375,000, a term of ten years, and an average rate of 4.30%.\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Actual repayments of loans may differ from the maturities reflected below because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.\nThe following table summarizes the loan maturity distribution by type and related interest rate characteristics.\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After one </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One year </td> <td> </td> <td>but within </td> <td> </td> <td>After five </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>or less </td> <td> </td> <td>five years </td> <td> </td> <td>years </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Owner occupied RE </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,171 </td> <td> </td> <td>167,425 </td> <td> </td> <td>125,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316,818 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-owner occupied RE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,519 </td> <td> </td> <td>165,764 </td> <td> </td> <td>107,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>312,798 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,086 </td> <td> </td> <td>12,796 </td> <td> </td> <td>25,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,179 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,588 </td> <td> </td> <td>107,584 </td> <td> </td> <td>44,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226,158 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total commercial loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150,364 </td> <td> </td> <td>453,569 </td> <td> </td> <td>303,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>906,953 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,172 </td> <td> </td> <td>61,809 </td> <td> </td> <td>181,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>273,050 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,331 </td> <td> </td> <td>25,807 </td> <td> </td> <td>117,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156,141 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,943 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,737 </td> <td> </td> <td>11,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,351 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,203 </td> <td> </td> <td>11,371 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,575 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total consumer loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,649 </td> <td> </td> <td>100,724 </td> <td> </td> <td>313,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>480,117 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total gross loan, net of deferred fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>216,013 </td> <td> </td> <td>554,293 </td> <td> </td> <td>616,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,387,070 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans maturing - after one year with </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fixed interest rates </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>875,991 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Floating interest rates </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295,066 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets include real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed taken in lieu of foreclosure and loans on nonaccrual status. The following table shows the nonperforming assets and the related percentage of nonperforming assets to total assets and gross loans for the five years ended December 31, 2017. Generally, a loan is placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest, or when we believe, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower's financial condition is such that collection of the loan is doubtful. A payment of interest on a loan that is classified as nonaccrual is recognized as a reduction in principal when received. Our policy with respect to nonperforming loans requires the borrower to make a minimum of six consecutive payments in accordance with the loan terms before that loan can be placed back on accrual status. Further, the borrower must show capacity to continue performing into the future prior to restoration of accrual status. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no loans 90 days past due and still accruing.\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Owner occupied RE </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>276 </td> <td> </td> <td>704 </td> <td> </td> <td>322 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,199 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-owner occupied RE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,581 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,711 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,170 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,344 </td> <td> </td> <td>373 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>783 </td> <td> </td> <td>914 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>910 </td> <td> </td> <td>686 </td> <td> </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,408 </td> <td> </td> <td>712 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>992 </td> <td> </td> <td>550 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>457 </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,144 </td> <td> </td> <td>256 </td> <td> </td> <td>258 </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nonaccruing troubled debt restructurings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,673 </td> <td> </td> <td>990 </td> <td> </td> <td>701 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,147 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,983 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total nonaccrual loans, including nonaccruing TDRs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,301 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,482 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,617 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,650 </td> <td> </td> <td>8,337 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other real estate owned </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>242 </td> <td> </td> <td>639 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,475 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,307 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,198 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total nonperforming assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,543 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,121 </td> <td> </td> <td>9,092 </td> <td> </td> <td>9,957 </td> <td> </td> <td>9,535 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nonperforming assets as a percentage of: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.46% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.46% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.75% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.97% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.07% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.54% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.53% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.90% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.14% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.30% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total loans over 90 days past due (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,027 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,984 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,547 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,735 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,493 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans over 90 days past due and still accruing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accruing troubled debt restructurings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,145 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,675 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,266 </td> <td> </td> <td>8,562 </td> <td> </td> <td>8,045 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> Loans over 90 days are included in nonaccrual loans\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017, nonperforming assets were $7.5 million, or 0.46% of total assets and 0.54% of gross loans. Comparatively, nonperforming assets were $6.1 million, or 0.46% of total assets and 0.53% of gross loans, at December 31, 2016. Nonaccrual loans increased $1.8 million to $7.3 million at December 31, 2017 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2016. During 2017, we added $3.8 million constituting 10 new loans to nonaccrual, while transferring four properties totaling $300,000 to real estate acquired in settlement of loans and charging off $555,000 on nonaccrual loans. The amount of foregone interest income on the nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $309,000 and $439,000, respectively.\nNonperforming assets include other real estate owned which decreased by $397,000 to $242,000 at December 31, 2017 from $639,000 at December 31, 2016. During 2017, we added three properties to other real estate owned for $288,000 and sold three properties for approximately $498,000 and recognized a $3,000 loss on the sales. In addition, we recorded write-downs on seven properties of $184,000. The balance at December 31, 2017 includes three commercial properties for $242,000. We believe that these properties are appropriately valued at the lower of cost or market as of December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the allowance for loan losses represented 212.6%, 271.0%, and 206.0% of the amount of nonaccrual loans, respectively. A significant portion, or 85.1%, of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2017 are secured by real estate. Our nonaccrual loans have been charged down to approximately 61% of their original nonperforming balance. We have evaluated the underlying collateral on these loans and believe that the collateral on these loans is sufficient to minimize future losses. As a result of this level of coverage on nonaccrual loans, we believe the allowance for loan losses of $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to be adequate.\nAs a general practice, most of our loans are originated with relatively short maturities of less than 10 years. As a result, when a loan reaches its maturity we frequently renew the loan and thus extend its maturity using similar credit standards as those used when the loan was first originated. Due to these loan practices, we may, at times, renew loans which are classified as nonaccrual after evaluating the loan's collateral value and financial strength of its guarantors. Nonaccrual loans are renewed at terms generally consistent with the ultimate source of repayment and rarely at reduced rates. In these cases the Bank will seek additional credit enhancements, such as additional collateral or additional guarantees to further protect the loan. When a loan is no longer performing in accordance with its stated terms, the Bank will typically seek performance under the guarantee.\nIn addition, approximately 82% of our loans are collateralized by real estate and approximately 80% of our impaired loans are secured by real estate. The Bank utilizes third party appraisers to determine the fair value of collateral dependent loans. Our current loan and appraisal policies require the Bank to obtain updated appraisals on an annual basis, either through a new external appraisal or an internal appraisal evaluation. Impaired loans are individually reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine the level of impairment. As of December 31, 2017, we do not have any impaired loans carried at a value in excess of the appraised value. We typically charge-off a portion or create a specific reserve for impaired loans when we do not expect repayment to occur as agreed upon under the original terms of the loan agreement.\nAt December 31, 2017, impaired loans totaled approximately $12.4 million for which $8.0 million of these loans have a reserve of approximately $3.7 million allocated in the allowance. During 2017, the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately $13.0 million. At December 31, 2016, impaired loans totaled approximately $11.2 million for which $7.5 million of these loans had a reserve of approximately $2.6 million allocated in the allowance. During 2016, the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately $11.6 million.\nThe Company considers a loan to be a TDR when the debtor experiences financial difficulties and the Company provides concessions such that we will not collect all principal and interest in accordance with the original terms of the loan agreement. Concessions can relate to the contractual interest rate, maturity date, or payment structure of the note. As part of our workout plan for individual loan relationships, we may restructure loan terms to assist borrowers facing challenges in the current economic environment. As of December 31, 2017, we determined that we had loans totaling $7.8 million, which we considered TDRs. As of December 31, 2016, we had loans totaling $6.7 million, which we considered TDRs. See Notes 1 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on TDRs.\nIn addition, potential problem loans, which are loans rated substandard and not included in nonperforming loans or TDRs, amounted to approximately $4.5 million, or 0.33% of gross loans at December 31, 2017, compared to $7.0 million, or 0.60% of gross loans at December 31, 2016. Potential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. The decrease in potential problem loans since December 31, 2016 is primarily the result of one individual commercial loan which was paid off during 2017, thus reducing total problem loans by approximately $2.3 million.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nAt December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the allowance for loan losses was $15.5 million and $14.9 million, respectively, or 1.12% and 1.28% of outstanding loans, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of our outstanding loan portfolio declined from the prior year as a result of the consistent credit quality of our loan portfolio during 2017, improved economic conditions and other qualitative factors. While our nonperforming assets increased by $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, our nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets remained consistent at 0.46% and our classified assets declined to 9.7% of capital, as compared to 12.7% of capital for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our allowance for loan losses.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our allowance for loan losses for the five years ended December 31, 2017.\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

and structured repurchase agreements. In the past, we have chosen to obtain a portion of our certificates of deposits from areas outside of our market in order to obtain longer term deposits than are readily available in our local market. We have adopted guidelines regarding our use of brokered certificates of deposit that limit our brokered certificates of deposit to 20% of total deposits and dictate that our current interest rate risk profile determines the terms. In addition, we do not obtain time deposits of $100,000 or more through the Internet. These guidelines allow us to take advantage of the attractive terms that wholesale funding can offer while mitigating the related inherent risk.\nOur retail deposits represented $1.4 billion, or 98.0% of total deposits at December 31, 2017, while our out-of-market, or brokered, deposits represented $28.1 million, or 2.0% of our total deposits at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, retail deposits represented $1.0 billion, or 94.6% of our total deposits, and brokered deposits were $59.1 million, representing 5.4% of our total deposits, at December 31, 2016. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 100%, 107%, and 102% at December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nThe following table shows the average balance amounts and the average rates paid on deposits held by us.\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Noninterest bearing demand deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>264,162 </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,401 </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>165,847 </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest bearing demand deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>218,355 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.18% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204,613 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.16% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>171,161 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.17% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Money market accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>463,314 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.81% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>317,260 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.44% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>262,218 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.41% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Savings accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,698 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,982 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,221 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.06% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Time deposits less than $100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,470 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.87% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,746 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.72% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,374 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.76% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Time deposits greater than $100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>258,076 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.08% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>215,605 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.85% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>225,152 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.77% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,271,075 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.58% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,011,607 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.39% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>894,973 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.40% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, our average transaction account balances increased by $220.3 million, or 29.7%, while our average time deposit balances increased by $39.2 million, or 14.5%. Core deposits exclude out-of-market deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or more and provide a relatively stable funding source for our loan portfolio and other earning assets. Our core deposits were $1.2 billion, $937.5 million, and $840.2 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAll of our time deposits are certificates of deposits. The maturity distribution of our time deposits of $100,000 or more is as follows:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Three months or less </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,480 </td> <td> </td> <td>39,379 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over three through six months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,327 </td> <td> </td> <td>30,964 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over six through twelve months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>78,741 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over twelve months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,915 </td> <td> </td> <td>62,883 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,710 </td> <td> </td> <td>211,967 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncluded in time deposits of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2017 is $28.1 million of wholesale CDs scheduled to mature within the next 12 months at a weighted average rate of 1.10%. Time deposits that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $131.7 million and $153.7 million, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss, and the ability to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves monitoring our sources and uses of funds in order to meet our day-to-day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits. Liquidity management is made more complicated because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control. For example, the timing of maturities of our investment portfolio is fairly predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made. However, net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to the same degree of control.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, our cash and cash equivalents amounted to $92.2 million and $46.6 million, or 5.7% and 3.5% of total assets, respectively. Our investment securities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 amounted to $72.1 million and $70.2 million, or 4.4% and 5.2% of total assets, respectively. Investment securities traditionally provide a secondary source of liquidity since they can be converted into cash in a timely manner. However, $11.4 million of these securities are pledged against outstanding debt. Therefore, the related debt would need to be repaid prior to the securities being sold in order for these securities to be converted to cash.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our deposit base and borrowing capabilities serves as our primary source of liquidity. We plan to meet our future cash needs through the liquidation of temporary investments, the generation of deposits, and from additional borrowings. In addition, we will receive cash upon the maturity and sale of loans and the maturity of investment securities. We maintain four federal funds purchased lines of credit with correspondent banks totaling $72.0 million for which there were no borrowings against the lines at December 31, 2017.\nWe are also a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, from which applications for borrowings can be made. The FHLB requires that securities, qualifying mortgage loans, and stock of the FHLB owned by the Bank be pledged to secure any advances from the FHLB. The unused borrowing capacity currently available from the FHLB at December 31, 2017 was $242.2 million, based on the Bank's $3.8 million investment in FHLB stock, as well as qualifying mortgages available to secure any future borrowings. However, we are able to pledge additional securities to the FHLB in order to increase our available borrowing capacity. In addition, at December 31, 2017 we had $165.1 million of letters of credit outstanding with the FHLB to secure client deposits.\nWe also have a line of credit with another financial institution for $15.0 million, which was unused at December 31, 2017. The line of credit bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% and matures on June 30, 2020.\nWe believe that our existing stable base of core deposits, federal funds purchased lines of credit with correspondent banks, and borrowings from the FHLB will enable us to successfully meet our long-term liquidity needs. However, as short-term liquidity needs arise, we have the ability to sell a portion of our investment securities portfolio to meet those needs.\nTotal shareholders' equity was $149.7 million at December 31, 2017 and $109.9 million at December 31, 2016. The $39.8 million increase during 2017 is due primarily to the issuance of 805,000 shares of common stock on May 2, 2017 in a public offering. The common stock was issued at $32.75 per share for net proceeds of $24.8 million. Proceeds from the offering were used to improve our capital structure, including to repay our former $10.0 million line of credit with another financial institution, to fund future organic growth, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Net income to common shareholders of $13.0 million combined with $1.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of restricted stock also contributed to the increase in shareholders' equity.\nThe following table shows the return on average assets (net income divided by average total assets), return on average equity (net income divided by average equity), and equity to assets ratio (average equity divided by average total assets) for the three years ended December 31, 2017. Since our inception, we have not paid cash dividends.\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average assets </td> <td> </td> <td>0.87% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.04% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.90% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average equity </td> <td> </td> <td>9.66% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.73% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.42% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average common equity </td> <td> </td> <td>9.66% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.73% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.42% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average equity to average assets ratio </td> <td> </td> <td>8.98% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.16% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.93% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common equity to assets ratio </td> <td> </td> <td>9.21% </td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.19%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>7.74% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the capital adequacy guidelines, regulatory capital is classified into two tiers. These guidelines require an institution to maintain a certain level of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital to risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders' equity, excluding the unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale, minus certain intangible assets. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0% to 100% based on the risks believed to be inherent in the type of asset. Tier 2 capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus the general reserve for loan losses, subject to certain limitations. We are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on total average assets, which is known as the Tier 1 leverage ratio.\nAt both the holding company and Bank level, we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. To be considered well-capitalized,\u201d we must maintain total risk-based capital of at least 10%, Tier 1 capital of at least 6%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5%. To be considered adequately capitalized\u201d under these capital guidelines, we must maintain a minimum total risk-based capital of 8%, with at least 4% being Tier 1 capital. In addition, we must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4%. As of December 31, 2017, our capital ratios exceed these ratios and we remain well capitalized.\u201d\nThe following table summarizes the capital amounts and ratios of the Bank and the regulatory minimum requirements.

dividends is dependent upon receiving cash in the form of dividends from the Bank. The dividends that may be paid by the Bank to the Company are subject to legal limitations and regulatory capital requirements.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe effect of relative purchasing power over time due to inflation has not been taken into account in our consolidated financial statements. Rather, our financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnlike most industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. Therefore, the effect of changes in interest rates will have a more significant impact on our performance than will the effect of changing prices and inflation in general. In addition, interest rates may generally increase as the rate of inflation increases, although not necessarily in the same magnitude. As discussed previously, we seek to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide rate fluctuations, including those resulting from inflation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Risk\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client as long as the client has not violated any material condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. At December 31, 2017, unfunded commitments to extend credit were approximately $345.9 million, of which $96.4 million is at fixed rates and $249.5 million is at variable rates. At December 31, 2016, unfunded commitments to extend credit were $226.6 million, of which approximately $57.8 million was at fixed rates and $168.8 million was at variable rates. A significant portion of the unfunded commitments related to consumer equity lines of credit. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that a significant portion of these lines of credit will not be funded. We evaluate each client's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation of the borrower. The type of collateral varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and commercial and residential real estate.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was a $6.3 million and $4.4 million commitment under letters of credit, respectively. The credit risk and collateral involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to clients. Since most of the letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon, they do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nExcept as disclosed in this document, we are not involved in off-balance sheet contractual relationships, unconsolidated related entities that have off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments that significantly impact earnings.\nMarket Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nMarket risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates, which principally arises from interest rate risk inherent in our lending, investing, deposit gathering, and borrowing activities. Other types of market risks, such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk, do not generally arise in the normal course of our business.\nWe actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure in order to control the mix and maturities of our assets and liabilities utilizing a process we call asset/liability management. The essential purposes of asset/liability management are to ensure adequate liquidity and to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to minimize potentially adverse impacts on earnings from changes in market interest rates. Our asset/liability management committee ( ALCO\u201d) monitors and considers methods of managing exposure to interest rate risk. We have both an internal ALCO consisting of senior management that meets at various times during each month and a board ALCO that meets monthly. The ALCOs are responsible for maintaining the level of interest rate sensitivity of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities within board-approved limits.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the following table summarizes the forecasted impact on net interest income using a base case scenario given upward and downward movements in interest rates of 100, 200, and 300 basis points based on forecasted assumptions of prepayment speeds, nominal interest rates and loan and deposit repricing rates. Estimates are based on current economic conditions, historical interest rate cycles and other factors deemed to be relevant. However, underlying assumptions may be impacted in future periods which were not known to management at the time of the issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, management's assumptions may or may not prove valid. No assurance can be given that changing economic conditions and other relevant factors impacting our net interest income will not cause actual occurrences to differ from underlying assumptions. In addition, this analysis does not consider any strategic changes to our balance sheet which management may consider as a result of changes in market conditions.\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Change in net interest </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest rate scenario </td> <td>income from base </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Up 300 basis points </td> <td>1.77% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Up 200 basis points </td> <td>1.93% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Up 100 basis points </td> <td>1.48% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Base </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Down 100 basis points </td> <td>(4.84)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Down 200 basis points </td> <td>(5.75)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Down 300 basis points </td> <td>(7.82)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nWe utilize a variety of short-term and long-term borrowings to supplement our supply of lendable funds, to assist in meeting deposit withdrawal requirements, and to fund growth of interest-earning assets in excess of traditional deposit growth. Certificates of deposit, structured repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, and junior subordinate debentures serve as our primary sources of such funds.\nObligations under noncancelable operating lease agreements are payable over several years with the longest obligation expiring in 2028.

The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. The guidance will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.\nThe Company's revenue is comprised of net interest income and noninterest income. The scope of the guidance explicitly excludes net interest income as well as many other revenues for financial assets and liabilities including loans, leases, securities, and derivatives. Accordingly, the majority of our revenues will not be affected. The Company is currently assessing our revenue contracts related to revenue streams that are within the scope of the standard. Our accounting policies will not change materially since the principles of revenue recognition from the ASU are largely consistent with existing guidance and current practices applied by our businesses. We have not identified material changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition. Based on the updated guidance, we do anticipate changes in our disclosures associated with our revenues.\nIn January 2016, the FASB amended the Financial Instruments topic of the ASC to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will apply the guidance by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values will be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the amendments. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB amended the Leases topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to revise certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of leasing transactions. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years\nWe expect to adopt the guidance using the modified retrospective method and practical expedients for transition. The practical expedients allow us to largely account for our existing leases consistent with current guidance except for the incremental balance sheet recognition for lessees. We have started an initial evaluation of our leasing contracts and activities. We have also started developing our methodology to estimate the right-of use assets and lease liabilities, which is based on the present value of lease payments (the December 31, 2017 future minimum lease payments were $13.8 million). We do not expect a material change to the timing of expense recognition, but we are early in the implementation process and will continue to evaluate the impact. We are evaluating our existing disclosures and may need to provide additional information as a result of adoption of the ASU.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including the income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. Additionally, the guidance simplifies two areas specific to entities other than public business entities allowing them to apply a practical expedient to estimate the expected term for all awards with performance or service conditions that have certain characteristics and also allowing them to make a one-time election to switch from measuring all liability-classified awards at fair value to measuring them at intrinsic value. The amendments will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. These amendments did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance to change the accounting for credit losses and modify the impairment model for certain debt securities. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all organizations for periods beginning after December 15, 2018.\nThe Company will apply the amendments to the ASU through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. While early adoption is permitted beginning in first quarter 2019, we do not expect to elect that option. We are evaluating the impact of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements. In addition to our allowance for loan losses, we will also record an allowance for credit losses on debt securities instead of applying the impairment model currently utilized. The amount of the adjustments will be impacted by each portfolio's composition and credit quality at the adoption date as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time.\nIn August 2016, the FASB amended the Statement of Cash Flows topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB amended the Statement of Cash Flows topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify how restricted cash is presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.\nIn March 2017, the FASB amended the requirement in the Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification related to the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. The amendments shorten the amortization period for the premium to the earliest call date. The amendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.\nIn May 2017, the FASB amended the requirements in the Compensation-Stock Compensation Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification related to changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The amendments provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The amendments will be effective for the Company for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.\nIn February 2018, the FASB Issued (ASU 2018-02), Income Statement (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which requires Companies to reclassify the stranded effects in other comprehensive income to retained earnings as a result of the change in the tax rates under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company has opted to early adopt this pronouncement by retrospective application to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the tax rate under the Tax Act is recognized. The impact of the reclassification from other comprehensive income to retained earnings did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.", "summary": "- This report provides information on the balance sheet, income statement, and market data for Bank of America Corporation (BAC) as of December 31, 2006, and the reported

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nOur business model continues to be client-focused, utilizing relationship teams to provide our clients with a specific banker contact and support team responsible for all of their banking needs. The purpose of this structure is to provide a consistent and superior level of professional service, and we believe it provides us with a distinct competitive advantage. We consider exceptional client service to be a critical part of our culture, which we refer to as \"ClientFIRST.\"\nAt December 31, 2017, we had total assets of $1.62 billion, a 21.2% increase from total assets of $1.34 billion at December 31, 2016. The largest components of our total assets are loans and securities which were $1.39 billion and $72.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. Comparatively, our loans and securities totaled $1.16 billion and $70.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Our liabilities and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017 totaled $1.47 billion and $149.7 million, respectively, compared to liabilities of $1.23 billion and shareholders' equity of $109.9 million at December 31, 2016. The principal component of our liabilities is deposits which were $1.38 billion and $1.09 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLike most community banks, we derive the majority of our income from interest received on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the difference between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, which is called our net interest spread. In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other charges to our clients.\nOur net income available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $13.0 million, or diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) of $1.76 and $1.94 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. While our net income remained consistent from the prior year, net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a $2.4 million expense due to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset resulting from the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in December 2017. In addition, our net income available to stockholders increased by $2.9 million, or 28.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEconomic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government significantly affect most financial institutions, including the Bank. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as client preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in our market areas.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWe have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies.\nThe judgment and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions we make, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. Management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and has discussed these policies with the Company's Audit Committee.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan loss is management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nWe have an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that assesses the losses inherent in our portfolio. While we attribute portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Our process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristics of our commercial and consumer loan portfolio segments. For each portfolio segment, impairment is measured individually for each impaired loan. Our allowance levels are influenced by loan volume, loan grade or delinquency status, historic loss experience and other economic conditions.\nThe allowance consists of general and specific components.\nCommercial loans are assessed for estimated losses by grading each loan using various risk factors identified through periodic reviews. We apply historic grade-specific loss factors to each loan class. In the development of our statistically derived loan grade loss factors, we observe historical losses over 20 quarters for each loan grade. These loss estimates are adjusted as appropriate based on additional analysis of external loss data or other risks identified from current economic conditions and credit quality trends. For consumer loans, we determine the allowance on a collective basis utilizing historical losses over 20 quarters to represent our best estimate of inherent loss. We pool loans, generally by loan class with similar risk characteristics.\nIncluded in the general component of the allowance for loan losses for both portfolio segments is a margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating general losses in the portfolio. Uncertainties and subjective issues such as changes in the lending policies and procedures, changes in the local/national economy, changes in volume or type of credits, changes in volume/severity or problem loans, quality of loan review and board of director oversight, concentrations of credit, and peer group comparisons are qualitative and environmental factors considered.\nThe specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the value of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and consumer loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The specific component also includes an amount for the estimated impairment on commercial and consumer loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d), whether on accrual or nonaccrual status.\nWhile management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in local economic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are used in relation to our mortgage banking activities and require significant judgment and estimates in determining their fair value. We hold derivative instruments, which consist of rate lock agreements related to expected funding of fixed-rate mortgage loans to customers ( interest rate lock commitments\u201d) and forward commitments to sell mortgage-backed securities and individual fixed-rate mortgage loans ( forward commitments\u201d). Our objective in obtaining the forward commitments is to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the interest rate lock commitments and the mortgage loans that are held for sale. Derivatives related to these commitments are recorded as either a derivative asset or a derivative liability in the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. Both the interest rate lock commitments and the forward commitments are reported at fair value, with adjustments recorded in current period earnings in mortgage banking within the noninterest income section of the consolidated statements of income.\nFair Valuation of Financial Instruments\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Additionally, we may be required to record other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Further, we include in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the valuation methodologies used, and the related impact to income. Additionally, for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, we disclose the estimate of their fair value.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Accounting standards establish a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. The three levels of inputs that are used to classify fair value measurements are as follows:\n \u25cf Level 1 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 1 instruments generally include securities traded on active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange, as well as securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets. Instruments we classify as Level 1 are instruments that have been priced directly from dealer trading desks and represent actual prices at which such securities have traded within active markets. \u25cf Level 2 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques, such as matrix pricing, for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Instruments we classify as Level 2 include securities that are valued based on pricing models that use relevant observable information generated by transactions that have occurred in the market place that involve similar securities. \u25cf Level 3 - Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company's estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques. \nWe attempt to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. When available, we use quoted market prices to measure fair value. Specifically, we use independent pricing services to obtain fair values based on quoted prices. Quoted prices are subject to our internal price verification procedures. If market prices are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that use primarily market-based or independently-sourced market parameters. Most of our financial instruments use either of the foregoing methodologies, collectively Level 1 and Level 2 measurements, to determine fair value adjustments recorded to our financial statements. However, in certain cases, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument.\nThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of an instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value.\nWhen observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management's judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. When significant adjustments are required to available observable inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs. When an active market for a security does not exist, the use of management estimates that incorporate current market participant expectations of future cash flows, and include appropriate risk premiums, is acceptable.\nSignificant judgment may be required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are included in Level 2 or Level 3. If fair value measurement is based upon recent observable market activity of such assets or comparable assets (other than forced or distressed transactions) that occur in sufficient volume and do not require significant adjustment using unobservable inputs, those assets are classified as Level 2. If not, they are classified as Level 3. Making this assessment requires significant judgment.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis\nOur debt securities are classified as securities available for sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, after applicable taxes, are reported in shareholders' equity. We conduct other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) analysis on a quarterly basis or more often if a potential loss-triggering event occurs. The initial indicator of OTTI for debt securities is a decline in market value below the amount recorded for an investment and the severity and duration of the decline. For a debt security for which there has been a decline in the fair value below amortized cost basis, we recognize OTTI if we (1) have the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nReal estate acquired through foreclosure is initially recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less selling costs. Subsequent to the date of acquisition, it is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, adjusted for net selling costs. Fair values of real estate owned are reviewed regularly and write-downs are recorded when it is determined that the carrying value of real estate exceeds the fair value less estimated costs to sell. Costs relating to the development and improvement of such property are capitalized, whereas those costs relating to holding the property are expensed.\nIncome Taxes\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis. When income and expenses are recognized in different periods for financial reporting purposes versus for the purposes of computing income taxes currently payable, deferred taxes are provided on such temporary differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions taken or expected to be taken on its tax returns will more likely than not be sustained upon audit by the taxing authorities and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. The Company has recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possible materially, due to among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax act. The accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nOur level of net interest income is determined by the level of earning assets and the management of our net interest margin. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our net interest income was $50.9 million, $43.0 million, and $38.5 million, respectively. The $7.9 million, or 18.3%, increase in net interest income during 2017 was driven by a $238.3 million increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a $167.3 million increase in our average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in average earning assets is primarily related to an increase in average loans, while the increase in average interest-bearing liabilities is driven by an increase in interest-bearing deposits. During 2016, our net interest income increased $4.5 million, or 11.6%, while average interest-earning assets increased $125.6 million and average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $75.8 million.\nInterest income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $61.2 million, $51.2 million, and $46.0 million, respectively. A significant portion of our interest income relates to our strategy to maintain a large portion of our assets in higher earning loans compared to lower yielding investments and federal funds sold. As such, 96.1% of our interest income related to interest on loans during 2017, 96.3% during 2016 and 96.3% during 2015. Also, included in interest income on loans was $950,000, $816,000 and $1.1 million related to the net amortization of loan fees and capitalized loan origination costs for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest expense was $10.3 million, $8.2 million, and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Interest expense on deposits for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 represented 71.4%, 48.1%, and 47.8% of total interest expense, respectively, while interest expense on borrowings represented 28.6%, 51.9%, and 52.2% of total interest expense, respectively. The increase in interest expense on deposits during 2017 occurred as a result of a $290.0 million increase in our deposit balances which assisted in replacing $48.0 million of FHLB advances and other borrowings, as they matured during the year.\nWe have included a number of tables to assist in our description of various measures of our financial performance. For example, the Average Balances, Income and Expenses, Yields and Rates\u201d table shows the average balance of each category of our assets and liabilities as well as the yield we earned or the rate we paid with respect to each category during 2017, 2016, and 2015. Similarly, the Rate/Volume Analysis\u201d table demonstrates the effect of changing interest rates and changing volume of assets and liabilities on our financial condition during the periods shown. We also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates, and we have included tables to illustrate our interest rate sensitivity with respect to interest-earning and interest-bearing accounts.\nThe following table sets forth information related to our average balance sheet, average yields on assets, and average costs of liabilities at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. We derived these yields or costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. We derived average balances from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated. During the same periods, we had no securities purchased with agreements to resell. All investments were owned at an original maturity of over one year. Nonaccrual loans are included in earning assets in the following tables. Loan yields have been reduced to reflect the negative impact on our earnings of loans on nonaccrual status. The net of capitalized loan costs and fees are amortized into interest income on loans.\nAverage Balances, Income and Expenses, Yields and Rates\n\n\nOur net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.57% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 3.63% for 2016 and 2015. The main driver of the six basis point decrease in net interest margin during the 2017 period was a 24 basis point increase in the cost of our interest-bearing deposits, primarily money market and time deposits. During 2016, our net interest margin remained consistent when compared to the year ended 2015, although the yield on our interest earning assets declined by two basis points, driven by a seven basis point decline in loan yield. In addition, the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities increased one basis point during the 2016 period due primarily to an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings.\nOur average interest-earning assets increased by $238.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, while the related yield on our interest-earning assets decreased by two basis points. The increase in average interest earning assets was driven by a $205.4 million increase in average loan balances during 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, our average federal funds sold balances increased by $38.6 million during the 2017 period while our average investment balances decreased by $5.6 million. The two basis point decline in yield during the 2017 period was driven by the increase in average federal funds sold at yields much lower than the remainder of our interest earning assets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our average interest-earning assets increased by $125.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, while the yield on our interest-earning assets decreased by two basis points during the 2016 period. Our average loan balances increased by $124.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015, while our loan yield decreased by seven basis points during the same period. In addition, our average federal funds sold balances decreased by $16.0 million during the 2016 period. The decline in the yield on our interest-earning assets during 2016 was driven primarily by reduced yields on our loan portfolio, combined with a higher level of federal funds sold which have a lower yield than the rest of our interest-earning assets.\nOur average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $167.3 million during 2017 as compared to 2016, while the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by six basis points. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was driven by a $201.7 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits during the 2017 period, while the cost related to our deposits increased 24 basis points when compared with the prior year. In addition, our average FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased by $34.4 million during the year, partially offsetting the increase in cost of our interest-bearing deposits as these borrowings were at rates much higher than those of our interest-bearing deposits. During 2016, our average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $75.8 million as compared to 2015, while the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by one basis point during the 2016 period.\nOur net interest spread was 3.35% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.43% for the same period in 2016 and 3.46% for 2015. The net interest spread is the difference between the yield we earn on our interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. The two basis point reduction in yield on our interest-earning assets and the six basis point increase in the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, resulted in an eight basis point decrease in our net interest spread for the 2017 period.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nNet interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume. The following tables set forth the effect which the varying levels of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the applicable rates have had on changes in net interest income for the periods presented.\n\nNet interest income, the largest component of our income, was $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $7.9 million increase from net interest income of $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income is due to a $10.0 million increase in interest income partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in interest expense. During 2017, our average interest-earning assets increased $238.3 million as compared to 2016, resulting in $9.5 million of additional interest income, while higher rates on our interest-earning assets also increased interest income by $316,000 from the prior year. Overall, our average interest-bearing deposits increased by $201.7 million while our average FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased by $34.4 million. While the growth in interest-bearing deposits resulted in additional interest expense, the reduction in FHLB advances and other borrowings reduced our interest expense, resulting in a net decrease in interest expense of $483,000. However, higher rates on all of our interest-bearing liabilities increased interest expense by $2.2 million from the prior year.\nDuring 2016, our average interest-earning assets increased $125.6 million as compared to 2015, resulting in $5.9 million of additional interest income; however, lower rates on our interest-earning assets reduced interest income by $616,000 from the prior year. In addition, interest-bearing liabilities increased by $75.8 million during 2016, resulting in $444,000 of additional interest expense. In addition, higher rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increased interest expense by $259,000 from the prior year.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe have established an allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses charged as an expense on our statements of income. We review our loan portfolio periodically to evaluate our outstanding loans and to measure both the performance of the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Please see the discussion below under Results of Operations - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for a description of the factors we consider in determining the amount of the provision we expense each period to maintain this allowance.\nFollowing is a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a noncash expense related to the provision for loan losses of $2.0 million, bringing the allowance for loan losses to $15.5 million, or 1.12% of gross loans, as of December 31, 2017. In comparison, we added $2.3 million and $3.2 million to the provision for loan losses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting in an allowance for loan losses of $14.9 million, or 1.28% of gross loans, as of December 31, 2016, and an allowance for loan losses of $13.6 million, or 1.36% of gross loans, as of December 31, 2015. The lesser provision expense of $2.0 million during 2017 relates primarily to the continued improvement in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our net charge-offs were $1.3 million, representing 0.10% of average loans, and consisted of $1.6 million in loans charged-off, partially offset by $306,000 of recoveries on loans previously charged-off. In addition, nonperforming assets remained at 0.46% of total assets while our level of classified assets declined to 9.7% at December 31, 2017 from 13.2% at December 31, 2016. Factors such as these are also considered in determining the amount of loan loss provision necessary to maintain our allowance for loan losses at an adequate level. The continued improvement in these credit quality factors is the primary driver of the reduction in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of our total loans.\nWe reported net charge-offs of $1.1 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, including recoveries of $574,000 and $185,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net charge-offs of $1.1 million and $1.3 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively, represented 0.10% and 0.14% of the average outstanding loan portfolios for the respective years.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following tables set forth information related to our noninterest income.\n\nNoninterest income was $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $1.5 million, or 13.9%, decrease compared to noninterest income of $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in total noninterest income during 2017 resulted primarily from the following:\n \u25cf Mortgage banking income decreased $1.7 million, or 24.6%, driven by lower origination volume during 2017 due to an overall increase in the average market rate for new mortgage loan originations. \u25cf Service fees on deposit accounts increased $167,000, or 16.7%, and include service charges and other fees such as non-sufficient funds ( NSF\u201d), stop payment fees, overdraft fee income and returned item fees. \u25cf Other income increased by $361,000, or 19.6%, due primarily to increased income on our ATM and debit cards and wire fees, both of which are driven by an increase in transaction volume, as well as increased loan fee income, which includes late fees, appraisal review fees, and line of credit fees. \nNoninterest income was $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $2.4 million, or 28.9%, increase over noninterest income of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in total noninterest income during 2016 resulted primarily from the following:\n \u25cf Mortgage banking income increased $1.9 million, or 37.8%, driven primarily by a transition to mandatory delivery of mortgage loans to the secondary market in April 2016 (which traditionally results in a higher profit margin upon sale) combined with an increased volume of loans originated. \u25cf Service fees on deposit accounts increased $109,000, or 12.2%, and include service charges such as non-sufficient funds ( NSF\u201d), stop payment fees, overdraft fee income and returned item fees. \u25cf Other income increased by $262,000, or 16.6%, due primarily to increased loan fee income, which includes late fees, appraisal review fees, and line of credit fees, as well as increased income on our ATM and debit cards and wire fees, both of which are driven by an increase in transaction volume. \nNoninterest Expenses\nThe following tables set forth information related to our noninterest expenses.\n\nNoninterest expense was $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $3.4 million, or 10.8%, increase from noninterest expense of $31.2 million for 2016.\nThe increase in total noninterest expenses resulted primarily from the following:\n \u25cf Compensation and benefits expense increased $2.8 million, or 14.9%, during 2017 relating primarily to increases in base and incentive compensation as well as benefits expense. Base compensation expense increased by $1.9 million driven by the cost of 19 additional employees compared to the prior year, three of which were hired in relation to our new office in Atlanta, Georgia; five of which were hired as additional team leaders or mortgage executives in our existing markets; and the remainder of which were hired to support loan and deposit growth. Benefits expense, which includes insurance and 401k expenses, increased by $826,000. Incentive compensation, which is based on certain targeted financial performance goals met by management, increased by $166,000. \u25cf Occupancy expenses increased $539,000, or 15.0%, driven by increased rent expense as well as additional insurance, property taxes and maintenance expenses related to our new properties in Charleston, South Carolina and Raleigh, North Carolina. \u25cf Other real estate owned expenses decreased $987,000, or 81.2%, and includes $184,000 of write-downs related to seven properties and $44,000 of expenses related to the management of properties we own. \u25cf Outside services and data processing costs increased $504,000, or 19.0%, related primarily to increased software licensing and maintenance costs as well as ATM/Debit card-related expenses and FHLB letter of credit fees. \u25cf Professional fees increased by $154,000, or 12.7%, due to increased legal and accounting costs primarily related to the increased size of our institution as well as professional service fees related to our mortgage operations. \u25cf Other noninterest expenses increased by $230,000, or 12.9%, driven by an increase in travel and entertainment expenses, business meals, dues and subscriptions and bank staff expense. \nNoninterest expense was $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $3.0 million, or 10.5%, increase from noninterest expense of $28.2 million for 2015.\nThe increase in total noninterest expenses resulted primarily from the following:\n \u25cf Compensation and benefits expense increased $1.9 million, or 11.3%, during 2016 relating primarily to increases in base and incentive compensation. Base compensation expense increased by $1.8 million driven by the cost of 12 additional employees, six of whom were hired in relation to our new office in Raleigh, North Carolina, with the remainder being hired to support our growth in loans and deposits, combined with annual salary increases. Incentive compensation, which is based on certain targeted financial performance goals met by management, increased by $332,000. \u25cf Occupancy expenses increased $272,000, or 8.2%, driven by increased rent expense as well as additional insurance, property taxes and maintenance expenses on our properties. \u25cf Other real estate owned expenses increased $73,000, or 6.4%, and includes $428,000 of losses on sales of four properties, $466,000 of write-downs related to six properties, and $321,000 of expenses related to the management of properties we own. \u25cf Outside services and data processing costs increased $207,000, or 8.5%, related primarily to increased software licensing and maintenance costs as well as ATM/Debit card-related expenses and FHLB letter of credit fees. \u25cf Professional fees increased by $221,000, or 22.4%, due to increased legal and accounting costs primarily related to the increased size of our institution as well as professional service fees related to our mortgage operations. \u25cf Other noninterest expenses increased by $229,000, or 14.8%, driven by an increase in travel and entertainment expenses, business meals, and deposit account losses. \nOur efficiency ratio was 57.4% for 2017 compared to 57.9% for 2016. The efficiency ratio represents the percentage of one dollar of expense required to be incurred to earn a full dollar of revenue and is computed by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. The slightly improved efficiency ratio during 2017 relates primarily to the increase in net interest income due to significant loan growth and increased loan yields.\nIncome tax expense was $10.6 million, $7.3 million and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 44.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and 36.0% and 34.6% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Included in income tax expense for the 2017 period is $2.4 million of income tax expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset as a result of the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to 21% under the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017.\nInvestment Securities\nAt December 31, 2017, the $72.1 million in our investment securities portfolio represented approximately 4.4% of our total assets. Our available for sale investment portfolio included U.S. agency securities, SBA securities, state and political subdivisions, and mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $67.6 million and amortized cost of $68.2 million for an unrealized loss of $578,000.\nThe amortized costs and the fair value of our investments are as follows.\n\nContractual maturities and yields on our investments are shown in the following table. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\n\nOther investments are comprised of the following and are recorded at cost which approximates fair value.\n\nLoans\nSince loans typically provide higher interest yields than other types of interest-earning assets, a substantial percentage of our earning assets are invested in our loan portfolio. Average loans for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Before allowance for loan losses, total loans outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.\nThe principal component of", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nOur business model continues to be client-focused, utilizing relationship teams to provide our clients with a specific banker contact and support team responsible for all of their banking needs. The purpose of this structure is to provide a consistent and superior level of professional service, and we believe it provides us with a distinct competitive advantage. We consider exceptional client service to be a critical part of our culture, which we refer to as \"ClientFIRST.\"\nAt December 31, 2017, we had total assets of $1.62 billion, a 21.2% increase from total assets of $1.34 billion at December 31, 2016. The largest components of our total assets are loans and securities which were $1.39 billion and $72.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. Comparatively, our loans and securities totaled $1.16 billion and $70.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Our liabilities and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017 totaled $1.47 billion and $149.7 million, respectively, compared to liabilities of $1.23 billion and shareholders' equity of $109.9 million at December 31, 2016. The principal component of our liabilities is deposits which were $1.38 billion and $1.09 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLike most community banks, we derive the majority of our income from interest received on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the difference between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, which is called our net interest spread. In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other charges to our clients.\nOur net income available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $13.0 million, or diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) of $1.76 and $1.94 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. While our net income remained consistent from the prior year, net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a $2.4 million expense due to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset resulting from the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in December 2017. In addition, our net income available to stockholders increased by $2.9 million, or 28.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEconomic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government significantly affect most financial institutions, including the Bank. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as client preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in our market areas.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWe have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies.\nThe judgment and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions we make, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. Management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and has discussed these policies with the Company's Audit Committee.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan loss is management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nWe have an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that assesses the losses inherent in our portfolio. While we attribute portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Our process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristics of our commercial and consumer loan portfolio segments. For each portfolio segment, impairment is measured individually for each impaired loan. Our allowance levels are influenced by loan volume, loan grade or delinquency status, historic loss experience and other economic conditions.\nThe allowance consists of general and specific components.\nCommercial loans are assessed for estimated losses by grading each loan using various risk factors identified through periodic reviews. We apply historic grade-specific loss factors to each loan class. In the development of our statistically derived loan grade loss factors, we observe historical losses over 20 quarters for each loan grade. These loss estimates are adjusted as appropriate based on additional analysis of external loss data or other risks identified from current economic conditions and credit quality trends. For consumer loans, we determine the allowance on a collective basis utilizing historical losses over 20 quarters to represent our best estimate of inherent loss. We pool loans, generally by loan class with similar risk characteristics.\nIncluded in the general component of the allowance for loan losses for both portfolio segments is a margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating general losses in the portfolio. Uncertainties and subjective issues such as changes in the lending policies and procedures, changes in the local/national economy, changes in volume or type of credits, changes in volume/severity or problem loans, quality of loan review and board of director oversight, concentrations of credit, and peer group comparisons are qualitative and environmental factors considered.\nThe specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the value of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and consumer loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The specific component also includes an amount for the estimated impairment on commercial and consumer loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d), whether on accrual or nonaccrual status.\nWhile management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in local economic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are used in relation to our mortgage banking activities and require significant judgment and estimates in determining their fair value. We hold derivative instruments, which consist of rate lock agreements related to expected funding of fixed-rate mortgage loans to customers ( interest rate lock commitments\u201d) and forward commitments to sell mortgage-backed securities and individual fixed-rate mortgage loans ( forward commitments\u201d). Our objective in obtaining the forward commitments is to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the interest rate lock commitments and the mortgage loans that are held for sale. Derivatives related to these commitments are recorded as either a derivative asset or a derivative liability in the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. Both the interest rate lock commitments and the forward commitments are reported at fair value, with adjustments recorded in current period earnings in mortgage banking within the noninterest income section of the consolidated statements of income.\nFair Valuation of Financial Instruments\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Additionally, we may be required to record other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Further, we include in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the valuation methodologies used, and the related impact to income. Additionally, for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, we disclose the estimate of their fair value.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Accounting standards establish a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. The three levels of inputs that are used to classify fair value measurements are as follows:\n \u25cf Level 1 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 1 instruments generally include securities traded on active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange, as well as securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets. Instruments we classify as Level 1 are instruments that have been priced directly from dealer trading desks and represent actual prices at which such securities have traded within active markets. \u25cf Level 2 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques, such as matrix pricing, for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Instruments we classify as Level 2 include securities that are valued based on pricing models that use relevant observable information generated by transactions that have occurred in the market place that involve similar securities. \u25cf Level 3 - Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company's estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques. \nWe attempt to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. When available, we use quoted market prices to measure fair value. Specifically, we use independent pricing services to obtain fair values based on quoted prices. Quoted prices are subject to our internal price verification procedures. If market prices are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that use primarily market-based or independently-sourced market parameters. Most of our financial instruments use either of the foregoing methodologies, collectively Level 1 and Level 2 measurements, to determine fair value adjustments recorded to our financial statements. However, in certain cases, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument.\nThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of an instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value.\nWhen observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management's judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. When significant adjustments are required to available observable inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs. When an active market for a security does not exist, the use of management estimates that incorporate current market participant expectations of future cash flows, and include appropriate risk premiums, is acceptable.\nSignificant judgment may be required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are included in Level 2 or Level 3. If fair value measurement is based upon recent observable market activity of such assets or comparable assets (other than forced or distressed transactions) that occur in sufficient volume and do not require significant adjustment using unobservable inputs, those assets are classified as Level 2. If not, they are classified as Level 3. Making this assessment requires significant judgment.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis\nOur debt securities are classified as securities available for sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, after applicable taxes, are reported in shareholders' equity. We conduct other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) analysis on a quarterly basis or more often if a potential loss-triggering event occurs. The initial indicator of OTTI for debt securities is a decline in market value below the amount recorded for an investment and the severity and duration of the decline. For a debt security for which there has been a decline in the fair value below amortized cost basis, we recognize OTTI if we (1) have the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nReal estate acquired through foreclosure is initially recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less selling costs. Subsequent to the date of acquisition, it is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, adjusted for net selling costs. Fair values of real estate owned are reviewed regularly and write-downs are recorded when it is determined that the carrying value of real estate exceeds the fair value less estimated costs to sell. Costs relating to the development and improvement of such property are capitalized, whereas those costs relating to holding the property are expensed.\nIncome Taxes\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis. When income and expenses are recognized in different periods for financial reporting purposes versus for the purposes of computing income taxes currently payable, deferred taxes are provided on such temporary differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions taken or expected to be taken on its tax returns will more likely than not be sustained upon audit by the taxing authorities and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. The Company has recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possible materially, due to among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax act. The accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nOur level of net interest income is determined by the level of earning assets and the management of our net interest margin. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our net interest income was $50.9 million, $43.0 million, and $38.5 million, respectively. The $7.9 million, or 18.3%, increase in net interest income during 2017 was driven by a $238.3 million increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a $167.3 million increase in our average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in average earning assets is primarily related to an increase in average loans, while the increase in average interest-bearing liabilities is driven by an increase in interest-bearing deposits. During 2016, our net interest income increased $4.5 million, or 11.6%, while average interest-earning assets increased $125.6 million and average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $75.8 million.\nInterest income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $61.2 million, $51.2 million, and $46.0 million, respectively. A significant portion of our interest income relates to our strategy to maintain a large portion of our assets in higher earning loans compared to lower yielding investments and federal funds sold. As such, 96.1% of our interest income related to interest on loans during 2017, 96.3% during 2016 and 96.3% during 2015. Also, included in interest income on loans was $950,000, $816,000 and $1.1 million related to the net amortization of loan fees and capitalized loan origination costs for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest expense was $10.3 million, $8.2 million, and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Interest expense on deposits for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 represented 71.4%, 48.1%, and 47.8% of total interest expense, respectively, while interest expense on borrowings represented 28.6%, 51.9%, and 52.2% of total interest expense, respectively. The increase in interest expense on deposits during 2017 occurred as a result of a $290.0 million increase in our deposit balances which assisted in replacing $48.0 million of FHLB advances and other borrowings, as they matured during the year.\nWe have included a number of tables to assist in our description of various measures of our financial performance. For example, the Average Balances, Income and Expenses, Yields and Rates\u201d table shows the average balance of each category of our assets and liabilities as well as the yield we earned or the rate we paid with respect to each category during 2017, 2016, and 2015. Similarly, the Rate/Volume Analysis\u201d table demonstrates the effect of changing interest rates and changing volume of assets and liabilities on our financial condition during the periods shown. We also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates, and we have included tables to illustrate our interest rate sensitivity with respect to interest-earning and interest-bearing accounts.\nThe following table sets forth information related to our average balance sheet, average yields on assets, and average costs of liabilities at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. We derived these yields or costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. We derived average balances from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated. During the same periods, we had no securities purchased with agreements to resell. All investments were owned at an original maturity of over one year. Nonaccrual loans are included in earning assets in the following tables. Loan yields have been reduced to reflect the negative impact on our earnings of loans on nonaccrual status. The net of capitalized loan costs and fees are amortized into interest income on loans.\nAverage Balances, Income and Expenses, Yields and Rates\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The main driver of the six basis point decrease in net interest margin during the 2017 period was a 24 basis point increase in the cost of our interest-bearing deposits, primarily money market and time deposits. During 2016, our net interest margin remained consistent when compared to the year ended 2015, although the yield on our interest earning assets declined by two basis points, driven by a seven basis point decline in loan yield. In addition, the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities increased one basis point during the 2016 period due primarily to an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings.\nOur average interest-earning assets increased by $238.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, while the related yield on our interest-earning assets decreased by two basis points. The increase in average interest earning assets was driven by a $205.4 million increase in average loan balances during 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, our average federal funds sold balances increased by $38.6 million during the 2017 period while our average investment balances decreased by $5.6 million. The two basis point decline in yield during the 2017 period was driven by the increase in average federal funds sold at yields much lower than the remainder of our interest earning assets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our average interest-earning assets increased by $125.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, while the yield on our interest-earning assets decreased by two basis points during the 2016 period. Our average loan balances increased by $124.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015, while our loan yield decreased by seven basis points during the same period. In addition, our average federal funds sold balances decreased by $16.0 million during the 2016 period. The decline in the yield on our interest-earning assets during 2016 was driven primarily by reduced yields on our loan portfolio, combined with a higher level of federal funds sold which have a lower yield than the rest of our interest-earning assets.\nOur average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $167.3 million during 2017 as compared to 2016, while the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by six basis points. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was driven by a $201.7 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits during the 2017 period, while the cost related to our deposits increased 24 basis points when compared with the prior year. In addition, our average FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased by $34.4 million during the year, partially offsetting the increase in cost of our interest-bearing deposits as these borrowings were at rates much higher than those of our interest-bearing deposits. During 2016, our average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $75.8 million as compared to 2015, while the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by one basis point during the 2016 period.\nOur net interest spread was 3.35% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.43% for the same period in 2016 and 3.46% for 2015. The net interest spread is the difference between the yield we earn on our interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. The two basis point reduction in yield on our interest-earning assets and the six basis point increase in the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, resulted in an eight basis point decrease in our net interest spread for the 2017 period.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nNet interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume. The following tables set forth the effect which the varying levels of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the applicable rates have had on changes in net interest income for

component of our income, was $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $7.9 million increase from net interest income of $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income is due to a $10.0 million increase in interest income partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in interest expense. During 2017, our average interest-earning assets increased $238.3 million as compared to 2016, resulting in $9.5 million of additional interest income, while higher rates on our interest-earning assets also increased interest income by $316,000 from the prior year. Overall, our average interest-bearing deposits increased by $201.7 million while our average FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased by $34.4 million. While the growth in interest-bearing deposits resulted in additional interest expense, the reduction in FHLB advances and other borrowings reduced our interest expense, resulting in a net decrease in interest expense of $483,000. However, higher rates on all of our interest-bearing liabilities increased interest expense by $2.2 million from the prior year.\nDuring 2016, our average interest-earning assets increased $125.6 million as compared to 2015, resulting in $5.9 million of additional interest income; however, lower rates on our interest-earning assets reduced interest income by $616,000 from the prior year. In addition, interest-bearing liabilities increased by $75.8 million during 2016, resulting in $444,000 of additional interest expense. In addition, higher rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increased interest expense by $259,000 from the prior year.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe have established an allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses charged as an expense on our statements of income. We review our loan portfolio periodically to evaluate our outstanding loans and to measure both the performance of the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Please see the discussion below under Results of Operations - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for a description of the factors we consider in determining the amount of the provision we expense each period to maintain this allowance.\nFollowing is a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses.\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance, beginning of period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,752 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan charge-offs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,638 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,648 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,508 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan recoveries </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loan charge-offs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,332 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,074 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,323 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance, end of period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,629 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a noncash expense related to the provision for loan losses of $2.0 million, bringing the allowance for loan losses to $15.5 million, or 1.12% of gross loans, as of December 31, 2017. In comparison, we added $2.3 million and $3.2 million to the provision for loan losses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting in an allowance for loan losses of $14.9 million, or 1.28% of gross loans, as of December 31, 2016, and an allowance for loan losses of $13.6 million, or 1.36% of gross loans, as of December 31, 2015. The lesser provision expense of $2.0 million during 2017 relates primarily to the continued improvement in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our net charge-offs were $1.3 million, representing 0.10% of average loans, and consisted of $1.6 million in loans charged-off, partially offset by $306,000 of recoveries on loans previously charged-off. In addition, nonperforming assets remained at 0.46% of total assets while our level of classified assets declined to 9.7% at December 31, 2017 from 13.2% at December 31, 2016. Factors such as these are also considered in determining the amount of loan loss provision necessary to maintain our allowance for loan losses at an adequate level. The continued improvement in these credit quality factors is the primary driver of the reduction in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of our total loans.\nWe reported net charge-offs of $1.1 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, including recoveries of $574,000 and $185,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net charge-offs of $1.1 million and $1.3 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively, represented 0.10% and 0.14% of the average outstanding loan portfolios for the respective years.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following tables set forth information related to our noninterest income.\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mortgage banking income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,152 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,837 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,963 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Service fees on deposit accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,168 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,002 </td> <td> </td> <td>893 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income from bank owned life insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>811 </td> <td> </td> <td>736 </td> <td> </td> <td>685 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sale of investment securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td>431 </td> <td> </td> <td>297 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,202 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,840 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,578 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,337 </td> <td> </td> <td>10,846 </td> <td> </td> <td>8,416 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income was $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $1.5 million, or 13.9%, decrease compared to noninterest income of $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in total noninterest income during 2017 resulted primarily from the following:\n \u25cf Mortgage banking income decreased $1.7 million, or 24.6%, driven by lower origination volume during 2017 due to an overall increase in the average market rate for new mortgage loan originations. \u25cf Service fees on deposit accounts increased $167,000, or 16.7%, and include service charges and other fees such as non-sufficient funds ( NSF\u201d), stop payment fees, overdraft fee income and returned item fees. \u25cf Other income increased by $361,000, or 19.6%, due primarily to increased income on our ATM and debit cards and wire fees, both of which are driven by an increase in transaction volume, as well as increased loan fee income, which includes late fees, appraisal review fees, and line of credit fees. \nNoninterest income was $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $2.4 million, or 28.9%, increase over noninterest income of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in total noninterest income during 2016 resulted primarily from the following:\n \u25cf Mortgage banking income increased $1.9 million, or 37.8%, driven primarily by a transition to mandatory delivery of mortgage loans to the secondary market in April 2016 (which traditionally results in a higher profit margin upon sale) combined with an increased volume of loans originated. \u25cf Service fees on deposit accounts increased $109,000, or 12.2%, and include service charges such as non-sufficient funds ( NSF\u201d), stop payment fees, overdraft fee income and returned item fees. \u25cf Other income increased by $262,000, or 16.6%, due primarily to increased loan fee income, which includes late fees, appraisal review fees, and line of credit fees, as well as increased income on our ATM and debit cards and wire fees, both of which are driven by an increase in transaction volume. \nNoninterest Expenses\nThe following tables set forth information related to our noninterest expenses.\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,791 </td> <td> </td> <td>18,969 </td> <td> </td> <td>17,048 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Occupancy </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,121 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,582 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,310 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other real estate owned expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>228 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,215 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,142 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Outside service and data processing costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,158 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,654 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,447 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,146 </td> <td> </td> <td>962 </td> <td> </td> <td>855 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,362 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,208 </td> <td> </td> <td>987 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>737 </td> <td> </td> <td>807 </td> <td> </td> <td>870 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,009 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,779 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,550 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total noninterest expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,552 </td> <td> </td> <td>31,176 </td> <td> </td> <td>28,209 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense was $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $3.4 million, or 10.8%, increase from noninterest expense of $31.2 million for 2016.\nThe increase in total noninterest expenses resulted primarily from the following:\n \u25cf Compensation and benefits expense increased $2.8 million, or 14.9%, during 2017 relating primarily to increases in base and incentive compensation as well as benefits expense. Base compensation expense increased by $1.9 million driven by the cost of 19 additional employees compared to the prior year, three of which were hired in relation to our new office in Atlanta, Georgia; five of which were hired as additional team leaders or mortgage executives in our existing markets; and the remainder of which were hired to support loan and deposit growth. Benefits expense, which includes insurance and 401k expenses, increased by $826,000. Incentive compensation, which is based on certain targeted financial performance goals met by management, increased by $166,000. \u25cf Occupancy expenses increased $539,000, or 15.0%, driven by increased rent expense as well as additional insurance, property taxes and maintenance expenses related to our new properties in Charleston, South Carolina and Raleigh, North Carolina. \u25cf Other real estate owned expenses decreased $987,000, or 81.2%, and includes $184,000 of write-downs related to seven properties and $44,000 of expenses related to the management of properties we own. \u25cf Outside services and data processing costs increased $504,000, or 19.0%, related primarily to increased software licensing and maintenance costs as well as ATM/Debit card-related expenses and FHLB letter of credit fees. \u25cf Professional fees increased by $154,000, or 12.7%, due to increased legal and accounting costs primarily related to the increased size of our institution as well as professional service fees related to our mortgage operations. \u25cf Other noninterest expenses increased by $230,000, or 12.9%, driven by an increase in travel and entertainment expenses, business meals, dues and subscriptions and bank staff expense. \nNoninterest expense was $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $3.0 million, or 10.5%, increase from noninterest expense of $28.2 million for 2015.\nThe increase in total noninterest expenses resulted primarily from the following:\n \u25cf Compensation and benefits expense increased $1.9 million, or 11.3%, during 2016 relating primarily to increases in base and incentive compensation. Base compensation expense increased by $1.8 million driven by the cost of 12 additional employees, six of whom were hired in relation to our new office in Raleigh, North Carolina, with the remainder being hired to support our growth in loans and deposits, combined with annual salary increases. Incentive compensation, which is based on certain targeted financial performance goals met by management, increased by $332,000. \u25cf Occupancy expenses increased $272,000, or 8.2%, driven by increased rent expense as well as additional insurance, property taxes and maintenance expenses on our properties. \u25cf Other real estate owned expenses increased $73,000, or 6.4%, and includes $428,000 of losses on sales of four properties, $466,000 of write-downs related to six properties, and $321,000 of expenses related to the management of properties we own. \u25cf Outside services and data processing costs increased $207,000, or 8.5%, related primarily to increased software licensing and maintenance costs as well as ATM/Debit card-related expenses and FHLB letter of credit fees. \u25cf Professional fees increased by $221,000, or 22.4%, due to increased legal and accounting costs primarily related to the increased size of our institution as well as professional service fees related to our mortgage operations. \u25cf Other noninterest expenses increased by $229,000, or 14.8%, driven by an increase in travel and entertainment expenses, business meals, and deposit account losses. \nOur efficiency ratio was 57.4% for 2017 compared to 57.9% for 2016. The efficiency ratio represents the percentage of one dollar of expense required to be incurred to earn a full dollar of revenue and is computed by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. The slightly improved efficiency ratio during 2017 relates primarily to the increase in net interest income due to significant loan growth and increased loan yields.\nIncome tax expense was $10.6 million, $7.3 million and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
