Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in the fields of neurology and psychiatry. We are developing a pipeline of clinical and nonclinical product candidates that focuses on the various aspects of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, LBD, and other indications in the fields of neurology and psychiatry. Our goal is to be the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the fields of neurology and psychiatry.\nOur near-term focus is to develop our gene therapy product candidate, AXO-Lenti-PD, as a one-time treatment for Parkinson's disease. We intend to begin a Phase 1/2 study of AXO-Lenti-PD in advanced Parkinson's disease patients before the end of 2018. Prior to the recent in-licensing of AXO-Lenti-PD in June 2018, our primary focus has been on developing nelotanserin, a selective inverse agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, and intepirdine, an antagonist of the 5-HT6 receptor. In January 2018, we announced the results of a pilot Phase 2 Visual Hallucination study of nelotanserin in patients with LBD. We plan to make a determination of the overall development strategy for nelotanserin once we have reviewed final data from our currently ongoing Phase 2 study of nelotanserin in REM Sleep Behavior Disorder and have completed our ongoing comprehensive clinical, regulatory and commercial review. In addition, we will determine our development plans for RVT-104, a combination of rivastigmine and a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist, as a potential treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease or DLB, once we have completed our ongoing comprehensive clinical, regulatory and commercial review in the context of our recent acquisition of AXO-Lenti-PD and any other newly acquired assets.\nIn January 2018, we announced the discontinuation of our development of intepirdine following our announcement that neither Phase 2b HEADWAY clinical trial of intepirdine in patients with DLB nor the pilot Phase 2 Gait and Balance clinical trial of intepirdine in patients with dementia and gait impairment met their respective primary endpoints and the September 2017 announcement that our Phase 3 MINDSET clinical trial of intepirdine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease did not meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints. Following the announcement of Phase 3 MINDSET clinical trial results, we also discontinued further development of RVT-103 which had been intended for use in combination with intepirdine.\nWe have determined that we have one operating and reporting segment.\nWe were founded in October 2014 and our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, acquiring our product candidates and advancing our lead product candidates, intepirdine and nelotanserin, into clinical development. In June 2015, we completed our IPO, from which we raised net proceeds of $334.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In February 2017, we and our subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules, from which we raised net proceeds of $53.5 million. In April 2017, we completed a follow-on public offering of our common shares, from which we raised net proceeds of approximately $134.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. On June 5, 2018, we entered into a share purchase agreement with RSL, our majority shareholder, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to RSL 14,285,714 common shares at a purchase price of $1.75 per common share in a private placement for expected aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $25 million. The share purchase agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Closing of this private placement is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the lapse of a 20-day period following the mailing by us of an information statement relating to the private placement to our shareholders. The anticipated net proceeds from this private placement, together with the proceeds raised to date, are intended to fund our existing planned clinical development programs, the clinical development of AXO-Lenti-PD as well as additional business development activities, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue and we recorded net losses of $221.6 million, $181.0 million and $133.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur products in development, their stage of development, their mechanism of action and the indications for which they are intended to address are described in more detail in the section titled Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOxford BioMedica License Agreement\nOn June 5, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ASG, entered into the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, pursuant to which we received a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Oxford BioMedica to develop and commercialize AXO-Lenti-PD and related gene therapy products for all diseases and conditions. As partial consideration for the license, we will make an upfront payment to Oxford BioMedica of $30.0 million, $5.0 million of which will be applied as a credit against the process development work and clinical supply that Oxford BioMedica will provide to us. Under the terms of the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, we could be obligated to make payments to Oxford BioMedica totaling up to $55.0 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones and $757.5 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and sales milestones. We will also be obligated to pay Oxford BioMedica a tiered royalty from 7% to 10%, based on yearly aggregate net sales of the Gene Therapy Products, subject to specified reductions upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the Oxford BioMedica Agreement. These royalties are required to be paid, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest to occur of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product in such country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country, or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.\nWe are solely responsible, at our expense, for all activities related to the development and commercialization of the Gene Therapy Products. Pursuant to the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize a Gene Therapy Product in the United States and at least one major market country in Europe. In addition, we are required to meet certain diligence milestones and to include at least one U.S.-based clinical trial site in a pivotal study of a Gene Therapy Product. If we fail to meet any of these specified development milestones, we may cure such failure by paying Oxford BioMedica certain fees, which range from $0.5 million to $1.0 million.\nArena Development Agreement for Nelotanserin\nIn October 2015, we exercised an option to acquire global rights, title, interest and obligations in and to nelotanserin from our majority shareholder, RSL. In May 2015, RSL entered into a development, marketing and supply agreement for nelotanserin with Arena and we entered into a Waiver and Option Agreement with RSL. Upon the exercise of our option, we assumed RSL's rights and obligations under the Arena Development Agreement, as amended October 18, 2017. In January 2018, we were notified by Arena that it has assigned all of its rights and obligations under the Arena Development Agreement to an affiliate, 125 Royalty Inc. Under the Waiver and Option Agreement, we recorded $5.3 million as research and development expense, which was 110% of any payments made to Arena by RSL, and any costs incurred by RSL in connection with the development of nelotanserin. We will be responsible for future contingent payments under the Arena Development Agreement, including up to $4.0 million in potential development milestone payments, up to $37.5 million in potential regulatory milestone payments and up to $60.0 million in potential commercial milestone payments. Under the Arena Development Agreement, we are also obligated to purchase all commercial supplies of nelotanserin from Arena for a fixed price equal to 15% of net sales of nelotanserin.\nThe Arena Development Agreement will remain in effect until terminated: (1) by the parties' mutual agreement; (2) for any reason by us upon 90 days' written notice to Arena; (3) by either party upon written notice for the other party's material breach or insolvency event if such party fails to cure such breach or the insolvency event is not dismissed within the specified cure period; or (4) by Arena if we or our affiliates participate in a challenge to certain Arena patents.\nServices Agreements with Roivant Sciences, Inc. and Roivant Sciences GmbH\nIn October 2014, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, ASI, entered into a services agreement with RSI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RSL, or the services agreement, pursuant to which RSI provides us with services in relation to the identification of potential product candidates and project management of clinical trials, as well as other services related to our development, administrative and financial functions. In February 2017, in connection with the contribution and assignment of all of our intellectual property rights to ASG, we amended and restated this services agreement effective as of December 13, 2016, as a result of which ASG was added as a recipient of services from RSI. In addition, ASG also entered into a separate services agreement with RSG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RSL, effective as of December 13, 2016, for the provision of services by RSG to ASG in relation to the identification of potential product candidates and project management of clinical trials, as well as other services related to development, administrative and financial activities. Under the terms of both services agreements, we are obligated to pay or reimburse RSI and RSG for the costs they, or third parties acting on their behalf, incur in providing services to us, ASI or ASG, including administrative and support services as well as research and development services. In addition, we are obligated to pay to RSI and RSG at a pre-determined mark-up on the costs incurred directly by RSI and RSG in connection with any general and administrative and research and development services provided directly by RSI and RSG.\nFor the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred expenses of $8.5 million, $7.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively, inclusive of the mark-up, under the services agreements. We have recorded these charges as research and development expense and general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nRoivant Financing\nOn June 5, 2018, we entered into a share purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with RSL, our majority shareholder, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to RSL 14,285,714 common shares at a purchase price of $1.75 per common share in a private placement (the Private Placement\u201d), equal to the per share closing price of our common shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 5, 2018. The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Closing of the Private Placement is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the lapse of a 20-day period following the mailing by us of an information statement relating to the Private Placement to our shareholders. As of March 31, 2018, RSL held 69.6% of our outstanding common shares.\nThe aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Private Placement are expected to be approximately $25.0 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement to fund the clinical development of AXO-Lenti-PD as well as additional business development activities, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nLoan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc.\nOn February 2, 2017, we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries AHL, ASG and ASI entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules as agent and lender, which was amended on May 24 and September 22, 2017. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we, AHL and ASG, as the borrowers, borrowed an aggregate of $55.0 million at the closing. On May 24, 2017, the Loan Agreement was amended such that the required minimum amount of unrestricted cash applied commencing on July 1, 2017 and is equal to the lesser of (i) $35.0 million (the Applicable Amount\u201d) plus certain aged accounts payable amounts (as further defined in the Loan Agreement) and (ii) the outstanding amount of debt under the Loan Agreement plus certain aged accounts payable (as further defined in the Loan Agreement), provided that the Applicable Amount may be lowered to $30 million upon the achievement of certain clinical milestones as set forth in the Loan Agreement.\nASI issued a guaranty of the borrowers' obligations under the Loan Agreement and, at the closing, paid Hercules a facility charge of $550,000. The Term Loan bears interest at a variable per annum rate calculated for any day as the greater of either (i) the prime rate plus 6.80%, and (ii) 10.55%. Debt issuance fees paid to Hercules were recorded as a discount on the debt and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Loan Agreement. The Term Loan has a scheduled maturity date of March 1, 2021. The borrowers are obligated to make monthly payments of accrued interest under the Loan Agreement until September 1, 2018, followed by monthly installments of principal and interest through March 1, 2021. The interest-only period may be extended until either March 2019 or September 2019 if, in each case, we achieve certain clinical development milestones, as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The borrowers' obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first position lien on substantially all of their and ASI's respective assets, excluding intellectual property. Prepayment of the Term Loan is subject to penalty.\nIn connection with the entry into the Loan Agreement, we issued a warrant to Hercules, which was exercisable for an aggregate of 274,086 of our common shares at an exercise price of $12.04 per share. In August 2017, Hercules exercised the warrant on a cashless basis and received a net issuance of 129,827 of our common shares.\nThe Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants and representations and warranties, including a minimum cash covenant, a covenant against the occurrence of a change in control,\u201d financial reporting obligations, and certain limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), collateral, transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes, and deposit accounts. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, the occurrence of certain events that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect\u201d as set forth in the Loan Agreement, cross acceleration to the debt and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. As of March 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its covenants and obligations under the Loan Agreement.\nIn addition, for so long as the Term Loan remains outstanding, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to afford Hercules the opportunity to participate in future underwritten equity offerings of our common shares up to a total of $3.0 million.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue from the sale of any products, and we do not expect to generate any revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and begin to commercialize one of our product candidates in development.\nResearch and Development Expense\nSince our inception, our operations have primarily been focused on organizing and staffing our company; raising capital; and acquiring, preparing for and advancing our product candidates, intepirdine, nelotanserin, RVT-103 and RVT-104, into clinical development. Our research and development expenses include program-specific costs as well as unallocated internal costs.\nProgram-specific costs include:\nTable 262: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>direct third-party costs, which include expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and contract manufacturing organizations, the cost of consultants who assist with the development of our product candidates on a program-specific basis, investigator grants, sponsored research, manufacturing costs in connection with producing materials for use in conducting nonclinical and clinical studies, and any other third-party expenses directly attributable to the development of our product candidates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 263: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>upfront payments for the purchase of in-process research and development, which include costs incurred under the GSK Agreement and the Arena Development Agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Unallocated internal costs include:\nTable 264: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>share-based compensation expense for research and development personnel, including expenses related to RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSI and RSG employees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 265: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> personnel-related expenses, which include employee-related expenses, such as salaries, benefits and travel expenses, for research and development personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 266: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs allocated to us under our services agreements with RSI and RSG; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other expenses, which includes the cost of consultants who assist with our research and development, but are not allocated to a specific program.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Research and development activities will continue to be central to our business model. We expect to continue to incur research and development expense as we wind down our MINDSET, HEADWAY and Gait and Balance trials of intepirdine, and our MINDSET and HEADWAY extension studies, and continue our development program for nelotanserin in LBD. However, due to the termination of the MINDSET, HEADWAY and Gait and Balance trials of intepirdine, we expect our overall research and development expense to decrease significantly for the foreseeable future until such time as we undertake additional development programs, including in relation to additional product candidates we may in-license or acquire as we pursue our updated business plan. We also expect our share-based compensation and other employee-related expenses for our research and development personnel to decrease as a result of the recent reduction in headcount. For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the majority of our research and development expenses have been associated with advancing intepirdine. Our share-based compensation expense attributable to RSL common share awards has become less variable because of the December 2015 merger of BVC Ltd. ( BVC\u201d) with and into RSL, a transaction we refer to in this report as the BVC Merger. Refer to Note 6 \"Related Party Transactions,\" in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development, such as nelotanserin, generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials.\nThe duration, costs and timing of clinical trials of our products in development and any other product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 268: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the number of trials required for approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the per patient trial costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 270: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the number of patients who participate in the trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 271: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the number of sites included in the trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the countries in which the trials are conducted;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the number of doses that patients receive;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the duration of patient follow-up;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, the probability of success of our products in development and any other product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval of our product candidates for any indication in any country. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine in advance the duration and completion costs of any clinical trial we conduct, or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our products in development or other product candidates, if at all.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, legal and accounting fees, consulting services, services received under the services agreements and employee-related expenses, such as employee salaries and benefits and travel expenses for general and administrative personnel.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will decrease for the foreseeable future, primarily as the result of a recent reduction in share-based compensation and other employee-related expenses for our general and administrative personnel due to the recent reduction in headcount.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended March 31, 2018, March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2018, March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 (in

clinical studies and related wind down activities, $18.9 million related to nelotanserin, share-based compensation of $16.6 million, personnel-related expenses of $15.4 million and other unallocated costs of $5.1 million. The share-based compensation expense includes $4.3 million related to the RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSI and RSG employees.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $6.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, as personnel-related expenses increased by $5.9 million resulting from increased headcount, employee severance and other personnel benefits and other expenses increased by $3.4 million due primarily to increased expenses for consultants. Program-specific costs increased by $0.2 million, as expenses related to intepirdine decreased by $6.9 million due to the recent discontinuation of our development program for intepirdine, partially offset by a $6.6 million increase in expenses related to nelotanserin.\nResearch and development expenses were $134.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, and consisted primarily of $87.1 million related to intepirdine, share-based compensation expense of $19.2 million, $12.3 million related to nelotanserin, and personnel-related expenses of $9.4 million. Share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 includes share-based compensation expense of $9.2 million related to the RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSI and RSG employees.\nResearch and development expenses increased $58.1 million in the year ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in direct third-party costs of $71.1 million primarily related to our MINDSET study for intepirdine as a result of increased patient enrollment, offset by decreases in purchases of in-process research and development of $5.3 million and share-based compensation of $11.4 million. Personnel-related expenses increased $4.7 million due to higher headcount, while expenses under our services agreements decreased primarily due to a decrease in research and development services provided by RSI on our behalf.\nResearch and development expenses were $76.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, and consisted primarily of share-based compensation of $30.6 million, $28.0 million related to intepirdine and $7.5 million related to nelotanserin including $5.3 million for the acquisition of nelotanserin. Share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 includes share-based compensation expense of $19.3 million related to the RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSI and RSG employees.\nOn December 4, 2015, BVC, a non-public entity, which held a non-controlling ownership interest in RSL, our majority shareholder, was merged with and into RSL, with RSL as the surviving entity. The compensation amounts of $19.3 million include share-based compensation expense for BVC awards issued to RSI employees prior to the BVC Merger. Prior to the BVC Merger, we recorded share-based compensation expense, in relation to the share-based awards issued by BVC to RSI employees based on the changes in fair value of BVC share-based awards. As these BVC share based awards were not based on our or RSL's shares, they were remeasured at each reporting period date until performance was completed.\nAs a result of the BVC Merger, all outstanding BVC share-based awards were converted into RSL common share awards, with the same vesting and forfeiture terms as the original grant. The RSL common share awards are fair valued on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. At the time of the BVC Merger on December 4, 2015, the unvested BVC awards that were converted into common shares of RSL were remeasured at the estimated fair value of RSL and that fair value is recognized over the remaining requisite service period. On December 8, 2015 following the BVC Merger, RSL had a recapitalization in conjunction with a private financing.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $71.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2018, and consisted of personnel expenses of $22.6 million, share-based compensation expense of $15.3 million, general operating costs of $11.9 million, marketing expenses of $9.3 million, professional fees of $7.0 million and direct and indirect costs of $5.8 million allocated to us under the services agreements. The share-based compensation expense includes $1.1 million for RSL common share awards and RSL options issued to RSI and RSG employees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $26.2 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, as personnel-related expenses increased by $14.6 million resulting from increased headcount, employee severance and other personnel benefits, marketing expenses increased by $4.8 million related to pre-commercial launch activities and general operating costs increased by $5.8 million primarily due to increases in rent, amortization of leasehold improvements, consulting fees and travel associated with increased headcount.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $45.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, and consisted primarily of share-based compensation expense of $17.2 million, personnel-related expenses of $7.9 million, professional fees of $5.0 million, $5.0 million of expenses under our services agreements and marketing expenses of $4.5 million. The share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 includes $1.6 million for RSL common share awards and RSL options issued to RSI and RSG employees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $10.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation of $24.6 million, partially offset by an increase in personnel-related expenses of $4.2 million resulting from higher headcount and an increase in legal and professional fees of $3.0 million. In addition, expenses under our services agreements increased $2.5 million due to an increase in the general and administrative support services provided by RSI on our behalf and marketing expenses increased $1.9 million as a result of pre-commercial launch activities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $56.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 and consisted primarily of share-based compensation of $41.8 million and employee salaries and related benefits, legal and professional fees, and direct and indirect costs allocated to us under the services agreement. The share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 includes $34.1 million for RSL common share awards and RSL options issued to RSI employees. These compensation amounts include share-based compensation expense for BVC awards issued to RSI employees prior to the BVC Merger. Prior to the BVC Merger we recorded share-based compensation expense in relation to the share-based awards issued by BVC to RSI employees based on the changes in fair value of share-based awards which were remeasured at each reporting period date until performance was completed as discussed above.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $7.5 million and $1.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively, consisting of interest paid and the amortization of debt discount related to the Loan Agreement with Hercules.\nThere was no interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had cash totaling $154.3 million. In April 2017, we raised net proceeds of approximately $134.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, from the sale of 7,753,505 common shares in a follow-on public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 that we filed with the SEC in December 2016. The registration statement permits for the offer and sale from time to time of up to $750.0 million of any combination of registered common shares, preferred shares, debt securities and warrants.\nRoivant Financing\nOn June 5, 2018, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with RSL, our majority shareholder, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to RSL 14,285,714 common shares at a purchase price of $1.75 per common share in the Private Placement, equal to the per share closing price of our common shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 5, 2018. The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Closing of the Private Placement is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the lapse of a 20-day period following the mailing by us of an information statement relating to the Private Placement to our shareholders. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Private Placement are expected to be approximately $25.0 million.\nLoan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc.\nOn February 2, 2017, we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, AHL, ASG, and ASI, entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, as agent and lender. The loan and security agreement was amended on May 24 and September 22, 2017 and is referred to herein, as amended, as the Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we, AHL and ASG, as the borrowers, borrowed an aggregate of $55.0 million, or the Term Loan, at the closing. ASI issued a guaranty of the borrowers' obligations under the Loan Agreement, and at the closing, we paid Hercules a facility charge of $550,000. On May 24, 2017, the Loan Agreement was amended such that the required minimum amount of unrestricted cash applied commencing on July 1, 2017 and is equal to the lesser of (i) the $35.0 million Applicable Amount plus certain aged accounts payable amounts (as further defined in the Loan Agreement) and (ii) the outstanding amount of debt under the Loan Agreement plus certain aged accounts payable (as further defined in the Loan Agreement), provided that the Applicable Amount may be lowered to $30 million upon the achievement of certain clinical milestones as set forth in the Loan Agreement.\nThe Term Loan bears interest at a variable per annum rate calculated for any day as the greater of either (i) the prime rate plus 6.80%, and (ii) 10.55%. The Term Loan has a scheduled maturity date of March 1, 2021. The borrowers are obligated to make monthly payments of accrued interest under the Loan Agreement until September 1, 2018, followed by monthly installments of principal and interest through March 1, 2021. The borrowers' obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first position lien on substantially all of their and ASI's respective assets, other than intellectual property. If we prepay the loan prior to March 1, 2021, we will be obligated to pay Hercules a prepayment charge, based on a percentage of the then-outstanding principal balance, equal to 3.0% if the prepayment occurs within the first 18 months following February 2, 2017, 2.0% if the prepayment occurs after 18 months but prior to 36 months following February 2, 2017, and 1.0% if the prepayment occurs thereafter.\nThe Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants and representations and warranties, including a minimum cash covenant, a covenant against the occurrence of a change in control,\u201d financial reporting obligations, and certain limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), collateral, transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes, and deposit accounts. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, the occurrence of certain events that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect\u201d as set forth in the Loan Agreement, cross acceleration to the debt and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement.\nIn connection with the Loan Agreement, we issued a warrant to Hercules which was exercisable for an aggregate of 274,086 of our common shares at an exercise price of $12.04 per share. In August 2017, Hercules exercised the warrant on a cashless basis and received a net issuance of 129,827 of our common shares.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, we used $190.3 million and $4.3 million of cash in our operating and investing activities, respectively. For the year ended March 31, 2017, we used $112.1 million and $0.1 million of cash in our operating and investing activities, respectively. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses at least for the next several years. We do not expect to generate revenue unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one of our products in development. Our cash utilization may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our planned clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expenses as we:\nTable 282: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>initiate clinical development of AXO-Lenti-PD for advanced Parkinson's disease, including our planned Phase 1/2 trial;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continue the clinical development of nelotanserin for LBD and other indications;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 284: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continue the clinical development of RVT-104, a combination of a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist and high-dose rivastigmine;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>wind down the MINDSET, HEADWAY and Gait and Balance trials for intepirdine;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continue open-label extension studies for patients completing our nelotanserin phase 2 studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>seek to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize additional product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 288: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>integrate acquired technologies into a comprehensive regulatory and product development strategy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>achieve milestones under our agreements with third parties that will require us to make substantial payments to those parties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 290: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>hire and retain scientific, clinical, regulatory, manufacturing, quality control, commercial and administrative personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 292: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 295: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure for drug candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 296: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operate as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our primary use of cash is to fund the research and development of our product candidates. We believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our existing funds will not be sufficient to enable us to complete all necessary development and to commercially launch all of our products. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financing, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products or potentially discontinue operations.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from sales of our products in development, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and potential collaboration, license or development agreements. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds other than our Loan Agreement with Hercules. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders' ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our shareholders' rights. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for each of the periods shown (in thousands):\nTable 297: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(190,348\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(112,109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53,347\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(4,284\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(105\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,346\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>136,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities consist of net loss adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and share-based compensation expense, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $190.3 million and was primarily attributable to a net loss of $221.6 million, partially offset by $31.9 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $112.1 million and was primarily attributable to a net loss of $181.0 million, partially offset by $36.4 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense and increases of $26.5 million in accrued expenses and $7.9 million in accounts payable.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $53.3 million and was primarily attributable to a net loss of $133.1 million which includes costs incurred for research and development activities, including CRO fees, manufacturing, regulatory and other clinical trial costs and our general and administrative expenses, partially offset by $72.4 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $4.3 million, consisting of purchases of leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $0.1 million, consisting of purchases of computer equipment.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $5.3 million primarily for the payment made to RSL for nelotanserin.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $136.4 million, primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $134.5 million received from the sale of 7,753,505 common shares in a follow-on public offering.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $48.5 million, primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $53.5 million from our debt financing from Hercules, offset by the deferred payment of $5.0 million made under the terms of the GSK Agreement in June 2016.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $334.9 million, which was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $334.5 million from the IPO of our common shares.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the SEC's rules. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not subject to off-balance sheet risks.\nContractual Obligations\nOur long-term contractual obligations include commitments and estimated purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business. We have entered into commitments under the Arena Development Agreement, the license agreement with Qaam, the services agreements with RSI and RSG and subleases with RSI and agreements with third parties for office space. In addition, we have entered into various services agreements with third parties for pharmaceutical manufacturing and research activities. The manufacturing agreements can be terminated by us with 30 days written notice. We expect to enter into other commitments as the business further develops.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, we entered into two subleases with RSI for office space in New York, NY. Under the terms of the subleases, RSI paid rent obligations directly pursuant to a master lease, and then invoiced us based on our proportionate share of the space and overhead expenses, calculated based upon the relative numbers of full-time equivalent employees located on the premises. As a result, our rent obligations under these subleases were not fixed. For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred $0.9 million, $1.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in rent and shared office expense under this arrangement with RSI. In June 2017, we also entered into a license agreement for office space in New York, New York, under which we have remaining rent obligations of $0.9 million through January 2019. The Company ceased incurring rent expense under this arrangement with RSI after entering into the June 2017 license agreement for office space.\nAs of March 31, 2018, we did not have any ongoing material financial commitments, other than pursuant to the Arena Development Agreement, Loan Agreement and agreements to rent office space. As described in this report, we previously accrued $5.0 million as research and development expense for a contingent payment liability under the GSK Agreement. We paid this amount to GSK in June 2016.\nThe following table provides information with respect to contractual obligations as of March 31, 2018:\nTable 298: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations (in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Under 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>11,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent obligations (2)\n</td> <td>959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) estimated using interest rate in effect at March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) net of prepayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our financial statements, refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Significant estimates include assumptions used in the determination of some of our costs incurred under our services agreements with RSG and RSI, which costs are charged to research and development and general and administrative expense, as well as assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our common shares and stock awards. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe define our critical accounting policies as those under U.S. GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Not all of these significant accounting policies, however, require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates.\u201d We have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and we believe that our estimates relating to contingent payment liabilities, share-based compensation, research and development accruals and income taxes described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, and are critical accounting estimates.\u201d\nContingent Payment Liability\nOne significant estimate relates to the probability and timing of contingent payment liabilities recorded in the balance sheet. We paid $5.0 million in June 2016 related to the GSK Agreement. Had the specified criteria for payment not been met, or been met in a period different from our expectation, there could have been significant fluctuation in our financial results in future periods.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize share-based compensation expense related to stock options granted based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting share-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the share-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards, however, the fair value of the stock options granted to non-employees is remeasured each reporting period until the service is complete, and the resulting increase or decrease in value, if any, is recognized as expense or income, respectively, during the period the related services are rendered.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, which are used to determine the fair value of share-based awards. These assumptions include:\nExpected Term. The expected term represents the period that our share-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term).\nExpected Volatility. Because we do not have an extended trading history for our common shares, the expected volatility is estimated using weighted average measures of implied volatility and the historical volatility of our peer group of companies for a period equal to the expected life of the stock options. Our peer group of publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies was chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rates paid on securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the stock options.\nExpected Dividend. We have never paid, and do not anticipate paying, cash dividends on our common shares. Therefore, the expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero.\nA significant component of total share-based compensation expense relates to the RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSL, RSG and RSI employees. For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded share-based compensation expense of $5.4 million, $10.9 million and $53.4 million, respectively, in relation to the RSL common share awards and RSL stock options issued by RSL to RSL, RSG and RSI employees. These share-based compensation amounts include compensation expense for BVC awards prior to the BVC Merger on December 4, 2015. Share-based compensation expense is allocated to us by RSL based upon the relative percentage of time utilized by RSL, RSG and RSI employees on our matters. Prior to the BVC Merger, we recorded share-based compensation expense, in relation to the share-based awards issued by BVC to RSI employees based on the changes in fair value of BVC share-based awards. As these BVC share-based awards were not based on our or RSL's shares, they were remeasured at each reporting period date until performance was completed. As a result of the BVC Merger, all outstanding BVC share-based awards were converted into RSL common share awards, with the same vesting and forfeiture terms as the original grant. The RSL common share awards and RSL options are fair valued on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. At the time of the BVC Merger on December 4, 2015, the unvested BVC awards that were converted into common shares of RSL were remeasured at the estimated fair value of RSL and that fair value is recognized over the remaining requisite service period. On December 8, 2015 following the BVC Merger, RSL had a recapitalization in conjunction with a private financing.\nThe RSL common share awards are valued at fair value on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. As a result of the BVC Merger, the converted BVC awards will not be remeasured prospectively. The estimated fair value of these RSL common share awards was determined by the valuation of the December 8, 2015 RSL private financing. Prior to the BVC Merger, the fair value of BVC awards was based on RSL's valuation after considering the fair value of RSL's ownership interest in us and RSL's other investments, discounted cash flow analysis, transactions entered into and contemplated by RSL and relevant industry and comparable public company data. As RSL is a non-public entity, therefore the BVC awards prior to the BVC Merger and the RSL common share awards following the BVC Merger are classified as Level 3 due to their unobservable nature. Significant judgment and estimates were used to estimate the fair value of these awards and options, as they are not publicly traded. RSL common share awards and RSL options are subject to specified vesting schedules and requirements (a mix of time-based and performance-based events). The fair value is based on various corporate event-based considerations, including targets for RSL's post-IPO market capitalization and future financing events. The fair value of each RSL option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes closed-form option-pricing model.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical study costs are accrued over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. Payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product and payments for milestones achieved prior to regulatory approval of the product are expensed in the period incurred as research and development. Milestone payments made in connection with regulatory approvals are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the remaining useful life of the asset. Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred and primarily consist of the intellectual property and research and development materials acquired from GSK and Arena, certain costs charged by RSI and RSG under their services agreements with us, ASI and ASG and expenses from third parties who conduct research and development activities on our behalf. We expense in-process research and development projects acquired as asset acquisitions which have not reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded when, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, it is not more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realizable. When uncertain tax positions exist, we recognize the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. When and if we were to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, they would be reported in tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.", "summary": "- The

"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in the fields of neurology and psychiatry. We are developing a pipeline of clinical and nonclinical product candidates that focuses on the various aspects of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, LBD, and other indications in the fields of neurology and psychiatry. Our goal is to be the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the fields of neurology and psychiatry.\nOur near-term focus is to develop our gene therapy product candidate, AXO-Lenti-PD, as a one-time treatment for Parkinson's disease. We intend to begin a Phase 1/2 study of AXO-Lenti-PD in advanced Parkinson's disease patients before the end of 2018. Prior to the recent in-licensing of AXO-Lenti-PD in June 2018, our primary focus has been on developing nelotanserin, a selective inverse agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, and intepirdine, an antagonist of the 5-HT6 receptor. In January 2018, we announced the results of a pilot Phase 2 Visual Hallucination study of nelotanserin in patients with LBD. We plan to make a determination of the overall development strategy for nelotanserin once we have reviewed final data from our currently ongoing Phase 2 study of nelotanserin in REM Sleep Behavior Disorder and have completed our ongoing comprehensive clinical, regulatory and commercial review. In addition, we will determine our development plans for RVT-104, a combination of rivastigmine and a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist, as a potential treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease or DLB, once we have completed our ongoing comprehensive clinical, regulatory and commercial review in the context of our recent acquisition of AXO-Lenti-PD and any other newly acquired assets.\nIn January 2018, we announced the discontinuation of our development of intepirdine following our announcement that neither Phase 2b HEADWAY clinical trial of intepirdine in patients with DLB nor the pilot Phase 2 Gait and Balance clinical trial of intepirdine in patients with dementia and gait impairment met their respective primary endpoints and the September 2017 announcement that our Phase 3 MINDSET clinical trial of intepirdine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease did not meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints. Following the announcement of Phase 3 MINDSET clinical trial results, we also discontinued further development of RVT-103 which had been intended for use in combination with intepirdine.\nWe have determined that we have one operating and reporting segment.\nWe were founded in October 2014 and our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, acquiring our product candidates and advancing our lead product candidates, intepirdine and nelotanserin, into clinical development. In June 2015, we completed our IPO, from which we raised net proceeds of $334.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In February 2017, we and our subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules, from which we raised net proceeds of $53.5 million. In April 2017, we completed a follow-on public offering of our common shares, from which we raised net proceeds of approximately $134.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. On June 5, 2018, we entered into a share purchase agreement with RSL, our majority shareholder, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to RSL 14,285,714 common shares at a purchase price of $1.75 per common share in a private placement for expected aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $25 million. The share purchase agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Closing of this private placement is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the lapse of a 20-day period following the mailing by us of an information statement relating to the private placement to our shareholders. The anticipated net proceeds from this private placement, together with the proceeds raised to date, are intended to fund our existing planned clinical development programs, the clinical development of AXO-Lenti-PD as well as additional business development activities, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue and we recorded net losses of $221.6 million, $181.0 million and $133.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur products in development, their stage of development, their mechanism of action and the indications for which they are intended to address are described in more detail in the section titled Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOxford BioMedica License Agreement\nOn June 5, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ASG, entered into the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, pursuant to which we received a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Oxford BioMedica to develop and commercialize AXO-Lenti-PD and related gene therapy products for all diseases and conditions. As partial consideration for the license, we will make an upfront payment to Oxford BioMedica of $30.0 million, $5.0 million of which will be applied as a credit against the process development work and clinical supply that Oxford BioMedica will provide to us. Under the terms of the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, we could be obligated to make payments to Oxford BioMedica totaling up to $55.0 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones and $757.5 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and sales milestones. We will also be obligated to pay Oxford BioMedica a tiered royalty from 7% to 10%, based on yearly aggregate net sales of the Gene Therapy Products, subject to specified reductions upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the Oxford BioMedica Agreement. These royalties are required to be paid, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest to occur of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product in such country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country, or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.\nWe are solely responsible, at our expense, for all activities related to the development and commercialization of the Gene Therapy Products. Pursuant to the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize a Gene Therapy Product in the United States and at least one major market country in Europe. In addition, we are required to meet certain diligence milestones and to include at least one U.S.-based clinical trial site in a pivotal study of a Gene Therapy Product. If we fail to meet any of these specified development milestones, we may cure such failure by paying Oxford BioMedica certain fees, which range from $0.5 million to $1.0 million.\nArena Development Agreement for Nelotanserin\nIn October 2015, we exercised an option to acquire global rights, title, interest and obligations in and to nelotanserin from our majority shareholder, RSL. In May 2015, RSL entered into a development, marketing and supply agreement for nelotanserin with Arena and we entered into a Waiver and Option Agreement with RSL. Upon the exercise of our option, we assumed RSL's rights and obligations under the Arena Development Agreement, as amended October 18, 2017. In January 2018, we were notified by Arena that it has assigned all of its rights and obligations under the Arena Development Agreement to an affiliate, 125 Royalty Inc. Under the Waiver and Option Agreement, we recorded $5.3 million as research and development expense, which was 110% of any payments made to Arena by RSL, and any costs incurred by RSL in connection with the development of nelotanserin. We will be responsible for future contingent payments under the Arena Development Agreement, including up to $4.0 million in potential development milestone payments, up to $37.5 million in potential regulatory milestone payments and up to $60.0 million in potential commercial milestone payments. Under the Arena Development Agreement, we are also obligated to purchase all commercial supplies of nelotanserin from Arena for a fixed price equal to 15% of net sales of nelotanserin.\nThe Arena Development Agreement will remain in effect until terminated: (1) by the parties' mutual agreement; (2) for any reason by us upon 90 days' written notice to Arena; (3) by either party upon written notice for the other party's material breach or insolvency event if such party fails to cure such breach or the insolvency event is not dismissed within the specified cure period; or (4) by Arena if we or our affiliates participate in a challenge to certain Arena patents.\nServices Agreements with Roivant Sciences, Inc. and Roivant Sciences GmbH\nIn October 2014, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, ASI, entered into a services agreement with RSI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RSL, or the services agreement, pursuant to which RSI provides us with services in relation to the identification of potential product candidates and project management of clinical trials, as well as other services related to our development, administrative and financial functions. In February 2017, in connection with the contribution and assignment of all of our intellectual property rights to ASG, we amended and restated this services agreement effective as of December 13, 2016, as a result of which ASG was added as a recipient of services from RSI. In addition, ASG also entered into a separate services agreement with RSG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RSL, effective as of December 13, 2016, for the provision of services by RSG to ASG in relation to the identification of potential product candidates and project management of clinical trials, as well as other services related to development, administrative and financial activities. Under the terms of both services agreements, we are obligated to pay or reimburse RSI and RSG for the costs they, or third parties acting on their behalf, incur in providing services to us, ASI or ASG, including administrative and support services as well as research and development services. In addition, we are obligated to pay to RSI and RSG at a pre-determined mark-up on the costs incurred directly by RSI and RSG in connection with any general and administrative and research and development services provided directly by RSI and RSG.\nFor the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred expenses of $8.5 million, $7.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively, inclusive of the mark-up, under the services agreements. We have recorded these charges as research and development expense and general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nRoivant Financing\nOn June 5, 2018, we entered into a share purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with RSL, our majority shareholder, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to RSL 14,285,714 common shares at a purchase price of $1.75 per common share in a private placement (the Private Placement\u201d), equal to the per share closing price of our common shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 5, 2018. The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Closing of the Private Placement is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the lapse of a 20-day period following the mailing by us of an information statement relating to the Private Placement to our shareholders. As of March 31, 2018, RSL held 69.6% of our outstanding common shares.\nThe aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Private Placement are expected to be approximately $25.0 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement to fund the clinical development of AXO-Lenti-PD as well as additional business development activities, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nLoan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc.\nOn February 2, 2017, we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries AHL, ASG and ASI entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules as agent and lender, which was amended on May 24 and September 22, 2017. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we, AHL and ASG, as the borrowers, borrowed an aggregate of $55.0 million at the closing. On May 24, 2017, the Loan Agreement was amended such that the required minimum amount of unrestricted cash applied commencing on July 1, 2017 and is equal to the lesser of (i) $35.0 million (the Applicable Amount\u201d) plus certain aged accounts payable amounts (as further defined in the Loan Agreement) and (ii) the outstanding amount of debt under the Loan Agreement plus certain aged accounts payable (as further defined in the Loan Agreement), provided that the Applicable Amount may be lowered to $30 million upon the achievement of certain clinical milestones as set forth in the Loan Agreement.\nASI issued a guaranty of the borrowers' obligations under the Loan Agreement and, at the closing, paid Hercules a facility charge of $550,000. The Term Loan bears interest at a variable per annum rate calculated for any day as the greater of either (i) the prime rate plus 6.80%, and (ii) 10.55%. Debt issuance fees paid to Hercules were recorded as a discount on the debt and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Loan Agreement. The Term Loan has a scheduled maturity date of March 1, 2021. The borrowers are obligated to make monthly payments of accrued interest under the Loan Agreement until September 1, 2018, followed by monthly installments of principal and interest through March 1, 2021. The interest-only period may be extended until either March 2019 or September 2019 if, in each case, we achieve certain clinical development milestones, as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The borrowers' obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first position lien on substantially all of their and ASI's respective assets, excluding intellectual property. Prepayment of the Term Loan is subject to penalty.\nIn connection with the entry into the Loan Agreement, we issued a warrant to Hercules, which was exercisable for an aggregate of 274,086 of our common shares at an exercise price of $12.04 per share. In August 2017, Hercules exercised the warrant on a cashless basis and received a net issuance of 129,827 of our common shares.\nThe Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants and representations and warranties, including a minimum cash covenant, a covenant against the occurrence of a change in control,\u201d financial reporting obligations, and certain limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), collateral, transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes, and deposit accounts. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, the occurrence of certain events that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect\u201d as set forth in the Loan Agreement, cross acceleration to the debt and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. As of March 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its covenants and obligations under the Loan Agreement.\nIn addition, for so long as the Term Loan remains outstanding, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to afford Hercules the opportunity to participate in future underwritten equity offerings of our common shares up to a total of $3.0 million.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue from the sale of any products, and we do not expect to generate any revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and begin to commercialize one of our product candidates in development.\nResearch and Development Expense\nSince our inception, our operations have primarily been focused on organizing and staffing our company; raising capital; and acquiring, preparing for and advancing our product candidates, intepirdine, nelotanserin, RVT-103 and RVT-104, into clinical development. Our research and development expenses include program-specific costs as well as unallocated internal costs.\nProgram-specific costs include:\n \u2022 direct third-party costs, which include expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and contract manufacturing organizations, the cost of consultants who assist with the development of our product candidates on a program-specific basis, investigator grants, sponsored research, manufacturing costs in connection with producing materials for use in conducting nonclinical and clinical studies, and any other third-party expenses directly attributable to the development of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 upfront payments for the purchase of in-process research and development, which include costs incurred under the GSK Agreement and the Arena Development Agreement.  Unallocated internal costs include:\n \u2022 share-based compensation expense for research and development personnel, including expenses related to RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSI and RSG employees; \n \u2022 personnel-related expenses, which include employee-related expenses, such as salaries, benefits and travel expenses, for research and development personnel; \n \u2022 costs allocated to us under our services agreements with RSI and RSG; and \n \u2022 other expenses, which includes the cost of consultants who assist with our research and development, but are not allocated to a specific program.  Research and development activities will continue to be central to our business model. We expect to continue to incur research and development expense as we wind down our MINDSET, HEADWAY and Gait and Balance trials of intepirdine, and our MINDSET and HEADWAY extension studies, and continue our development program for nelotanserin in LBD. However, due to the termination of the MINDSET, HEADWAY and Gait and Balance trials of intepirdine, we expect our overall research and development expense to decrease significantly for the foreseeable future until such time as we undertake additional development programs, including in relation to additional product candidates we may in-license or acquire as we pursue our updated business plan. We also expect our share-based compensation and other employee-related expenses for our research and development personnel to decrease as a result of the recent reduction in headcount. For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the majority of our research and development expenses have been associated with advancing intepirdine. Our share-based compensation expense attributable to RSL common share awards has become less variable because of the December 2015 merger of BVC Ltd. ( BVC\u201d) with and into RSL, a transaction we refer to in this report as the BVC Merger. Refer to Note 6 \"Related Party Transactions,\" in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development, such as nelotanserin, generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials.\nThe duration, costs and timing of clinical trials of our products in development and any other product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 the number of trials required for approval; \n \u2022 the per patient trial costs; \n \u2022 the number of patients who participate in the trials; \n \u2022 the number of sites included in the trials; \n \u2022 the countries in which the trials are conducted; \n \u2022 the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; \n \u2022 the number of doses that patients receive; \n \u2022 the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; \n \u2022 the potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; \n \u2022 the duration of patient follow-up; \n \u2022 the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals; and \n \u2022 the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidates.  In addition, the probability of success of our products in development and any other product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval of our product candidates for any indication in any country. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine in advance the duration and completion costs of any clinical trial we conduct, or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our products in development or other product candidates, if at all.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, legal and accounting fees, consulting services, services received under the services agreements and employee-related expenses, such as employee salaries and benefits and travel expenses for general and administrative personnel.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will decrease for the foreseeable future, primarily as the result of a recent reduction in share-based compensation and other employee-related expenses for our general and administrative personnel due to the recent reduction in headcount.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended March 31, 2018, March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2018, March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\nFor the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company's research and development expenses consisted of the following (in thousands):\n\nResearch and development expenses were $141.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2018, and consisted primarily of $80.2 million related to intepirdine clinical studies and related wind down activities, $18.9 million related to nelotanserin, share-based compensation of $16.6 million, personnel-related expenses of $15.4 million and other unallocated costs of $5.1 million. The share-based compensation expense includes $4.3 million related to the RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSI and RSG employees.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $6.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, as personnel-related expenses increased by $5.9 million resulting from increased headcount, employee severance and other personnel benefits and other expenses increased by $3.4 million due primarily to increased expenses for consultants. Program-specific costs increased by $0.2 million, as expenses related to intepirdine decreased by $6.9 million due to the recent discontinuation of our development program for intepirdine, partially offset by a $6.6 million increase in expenses related to nelotanserin.\nResearch and development expenses were $134.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, and consisted primarily of $87.1 million related to intepirdine, share-based compensation expense of $19.2 million, $12.3 million related to nelotanserin, and personnel-related expenses of $9.4 million. Share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 includes share-based compensation expense of $9.2 million related to the RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSI and RSG employees.\nResearch and development expenses increased $58.1 million in the year ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in direct third-party costs of $71.1 million primarily related to our MINDSET study for intepirdine as a result of increased patient enrollment, offset by decreases in purchases of in-process research and development of $5.3 million and share-based compensation of $11.4 million. Personnel-related expenses increased $4.7 million due to higher headcount, while expenses under our services agreements decreased primarily due to a decrease in research and development services provided by RSI on our behalf.\nResearch and development expenses were $76.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, and consisted primarily of share-based compensation of $30.6 million, $28.0 million related to intepirdine and $7.5 million related to nelotanserin including $5.3 million for the acquisition of nelotanserin. Share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 includes share-based compensation expense of $19.3 million related to the RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSI and RSG employees.\nOn December 4, 2015, BVC, a non-public entity, which held a non-controlling ownership interest in RSL, our majority shareholder, was merged with and into RSL, with RSL as the surviving entity. The compensation amounts of $19.3 million include share-based compensation expense for BVC awards issued to RSI employees prior to the BVC Merger. Prior to the BVC Merger, we recorded share-based compensation expense, in relation to the share-based awards issued by BVC to RSI employees based on the changes in fair value of BVC share-based awards. As these BVC share based awards were not based on our or RSL's shares, they were remeasured at each reporting period date until performance was completed.\nAs a result of the BVC Merger, all outstanding BVC share-based awards were converted into RSL common share awards, with the same vesting and forfeiture terms as the original grant. The RSL common share awards are fair valued on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. At the time of the BVC Merger on December 4, 2015, the unvested BVC awards that were converted into common shares of RSL were remeasured at the estimated fair value of RSL and that fair value is recognized over the remaining requisite service period. On December 8, 2015 following the BVC Merger, RSL had a recapitalization in conjunction with a private financing.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $71.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2018, and consisted of personnel expenses of $22.6 million, share-based compensation expense of $15.3 million, general operating costs of $11.9 million, marketing expenses of $9.3 million, professional fees of $7.0 million and direct and indirect costs of $5.8 million allocated to us under the services agreements. The share-based compensation expense includes $1.1 million for RSL common share awards and RSL options issued to RSI and RSG employees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $26.2 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, as personnel-related expenses increased by $14.6 million resulting from increased headcount, employee severance and other personnel benefits, marketing expenses increased by $4.8 million related to pre-commercial launch activities and general operating costs increased by $5.8 million primarily due to increases in rent, amortization of leasehold improvements, consulting fees and travel associated with increased headcount.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $45.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, and consisted primarily of share-based compensation expense of $17.2 million, personnel-related expenses of $7.9 million, professional fees of $5.0 million, $5.0 million of expenses under our services agreements and marketing expenses of $4.5 million. The share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 includes $1.6 million for RSL common share awards and RSL options issued to RSI and RSG employees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $10.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation of $24.6 million, partially offset by an increase in personnel-related expenses of $4.2 million resulting from higher headcount and an increase in legal and professional fees of $3.0 million. In addition, expenses under our services agreements increased $2.5 million due to an increase in the general and administrative support services provided by RSI on our behalf and marketing expenses increased $1.9 million as a result of pre-commercial launch activities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $56.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 and consisted primarily of share-based compensation of $41.8 million and employee salaries and related benefits, legal and professional fees, and direct and indirect costs allocated to us under the services agreement. The share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 includes $34.1 million for RSL common share awards and RSL options issued to RSI employees. These compensation amounts include share-based compensation expense for BVC awards issued to RSI employees prior to the BVC Merger. Prior to the BVC Merger we recorded share-based compensation expense in relation to the share-based awards issued by BVC to RSI employees based on the changes in fair value of share-based awards which were remeasured at each reporting period date until performance was completed as discussed above.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $7.5 million and $1.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively, consisting of interest paid and the amortization of debt discount related to the Loan Agreement with Hercules.\nThere was no interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had cash totaling $154.3 million. In April 2017, we raised net proceeds of approximately $134.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, from the sale of 7,753,505 common shares in a follow-on public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 that we filed with the SEC in December 2016. The registration statement permits for the offer and sale from time to time of up to $750.0 million of any combination of registered common shares, preferred shares, debt securities and warrants.\nRoivant Financing\nOn June 5, 2018, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with RSL, our majority shareholder, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to RSL 14,285,714 common shares at a purchase price of $1.75 per common share in the Private Placement, equal to the per share closing price of our common shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 5, 2018. The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Closing of the Private Placement is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the lapse of a 20-day period following the mailing by us of an information statement relating to the Private Placement to our shareholders. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Private Placement are expected to be approximately $25.0 million.\nLoan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc.\nOn February 2, 2017, we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, AHL, ASG, and ASI, entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, as agent and lender. The loan and security agreement was amended on May 24 and September 22, 2017 and is referred to herein, as amended, as the Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we, AHL and ASG, as the borrowers, borrowed an aggregate of $55.0 million, or the Term Loan, at the closing. ASI issued a guaranty of the borrowers' obligations under the Loan Agreement, and at the closing, we paid Hercules a facility charge of $550,000. On May 24, 2017, the Loan Agreement was amended such that the required minimum amount of unrestricted cash applied commencing on July 1, 2017 and is equal to the lesser of (i) the $35.0 million Applicable Amount plus certain aged accounts payable amounts (as further defined in the Loan Agreement) and (ii) the outstanding amount of debt under the Loan Agreement plus certain aged accounts payable (as further defined in the Loan Agreement), provided that the Applicable Amount may be lowered to $30 million upon the achievement of certain clinical milestones as set forth in the Loan Agreement.\nThe Term Loan bears interest at a variable per annum rate calculated for any day as the greater of either (i) the prime rate plus 6.80%, and (ii) 10.55%. The Term Loan has a scheduled maturity date of March 1, 2021. The borrowers are obligated to make monthly payments of accrued interest under the Loan Agreement until September 1, 2018, followed by monthly installments of principal and interest through March 1, 2021. The borrowers' obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first position lien on substantially all of their and ASI's respective assets, other than intellectual property. If we prepay the loan prior to March 1, 2021, we will be obligated to pay Hercules a prepayment charge, based on a percentage of the then-outstanding principal balance, equal to 3.0% if the prepayment occurs within the first 18 months following February 2, 2017, 2.0% if the prepayment occurs after 18 months but prior to 36 months following February 2, 2017, and 1.0% if the prepayment occurs thereafter.\nThe Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants and representations and warranties, including a minimum cash covenant, a covenant against the occurrence of a change in control,\u201d financial reporting obligations, and certain limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), collateral, transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes, and deposit accounts. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, the occurrence of certain events that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect\u201d as set forth in the Loan Agreement, cross acceleration to the debt and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement.\nIn connection with the Loan Agreement, we issued a warrant to Hercules which was exercisable for an aggregate of 274,086 of our common shares at an exercise price of $12.04 per share. In August 2017, Hercules exercised the warrant on a cashless basis and received a net issuance of 129,827 of our common shares.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, we used $190.3 million and $4.3 million of cash in our operating and investing activities, respectively. For the year ended March 31, 2017, we used $112.1 million and $0.1 million of cash in our operating and investing activities, respectively. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses at least for the next several years. We do not expect to generate revenue unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one of our products in development. Our cash utilization may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our planned clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expenses as we:\n \u2022 initiate clinical development of AXO-Lenti-PD for advanced Parkinson's disease, including our planned Phase 1/2 trial; \n \u2022 continue the clinical development of nelotanserin for LBD and other indications; \n \u2022 continue the clinical development of RVT-104, a combination of a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist and high-dose rivastigmine; \n \u2022 wind down the MINDSET, HEADWAY and Gait and Balance trials for intepirdine; \n \u2022 continue open-label extension studies for patients completing our nelotanserin phase 2 studies; \n \u2022 seek to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize additional product candidates; \n \u2022 integrate acquired technologies into a comprehensive regulatory and product development strategy; \n \u2022 achieve milestones under our agreements with third parties that will require us to make substantial payments to those parties; \n \u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 hire and retain scientific, clinical, regulatory, manufacturing, quality control, commercial and administrative personnel; \n \u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development efforts; \n \u2022 seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \n \u2022 scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize our product candidates; \n \u2022 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure for drug candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and \n \u2022 operate as a public company.  Our primary use of cash is to fund the research and development of our product candidates. We believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our existing funds will not be sufficient to enable us to complete all necessary development and to commercially launch all of our products. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financing, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products or potentially discontinue operations.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from sales of our products in development, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and potential collaboration, license or development agreements. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds other than our Loan Agreement with Hercules. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders' ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our shareholders' rights. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for each of the periods shown (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities consist of net loss adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and share-based compensation expense, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $190.3 million and was primarily attributable to a net loss of $221.6 million, partially offset by $31.9 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $112.1 million and was primarily attributable to a net loss of $181.0 million, partially offset by $36.4 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense and increases of $26.5 million in accrued expenses and $7.9 million in accounts payable.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $53.3 million and was primarily attributable to a net loss of $133.1 million which includes costs incurred for research and development activities, including CRO fees, manufacturing, regulatory and other clinical trial costs and our general and administrative expenses, partially offset by $72.4 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $4.3 million, consisting of purchases of leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $0.1 million, consisting of purchases of computer equipment.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $5.3 million primarily for the payment made to RSL for nelotanserin.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $136.4 million, primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $134.5 million received from the sale of 7,753,505 common shares in a follow-on public offering.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $48.5 million, primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $53.5 million from our debt financing from Hercules, offset by the deferred payment of $5.0 million made under the terms of the GSK Agreement in June 2016.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $334.9 million, which was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $334.5 million from the IPO of our common shares.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the SEC's rules. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not subject to off-balance sheet risks.\nContractual Obligations\nOur long-term contractual obligations include commitments and estimated purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business. We have entered into commitments under the Arena Development Agreement, the license agreement with Qaam, the services agreements with RSI and RSG and subleases with RSI and agreements with third parties for office space. In addition, we have entered into various services agreements with third parties for pharmaceutical manufacturing and research activities. The manufacturing agreements can be terminated by us with 30 days written notice. We expect to enter into other commitments as the business further develops.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, we entered into two subleases with RSI for office space in New York, NY. Under the terms of the subleases, RSI paid rent obligations directly pursuant to a master lease, and then invoiced us based on our proportionate share of the space and overhead expenses, calculated based upon the relative numbers of full-time equivalent employees located on the premises. As a result, our rent obligations under these subleases were not fixed. For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred $0.9 million, $1.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in rent and shared office expense under this arrangement with RSI. In June 2017, we also entered into a license agreement for office space in New York, New York, under which we have remaining rent obligations of $0.9 million through January 2019. The Company ceased incurring rent expense under this arrangement with RSI after entering into the June 2017 license agreement for office space.\nAs of March 31, 2018, we did not have any ongoing material financial commitments, other than pursuant to the Arena Development Agreement, Loan Agreement and agreements to rent office space. As described in this report, we previously accrued $5.0 million as research and development expense for a contingent payment liability under the GSK Agreement. We paid this amount to GSK in June 2016.\nThe following table provides information with respect to contractual obligations as of March 31, 2018:\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our financial statements, refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Significant estimates include assumptions used in the determination of some of our costs incurred under our services agreements with RSG and RSI, which costs are charged to research and development and general and administrative expense, as well as assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our common shares and stock awards. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe define our critical accounting policies as those under U.S. GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Not all of these significant accounting policies, however, require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates.\u201d We have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and we believe that our estimates relating to contingent payment liabilities, share-based compensation, research and development accruals and income taxes described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, and are critical accounting estimates.\u201d\nContingent Payment Liability\nOne significant estimate relates to the probability and timing of contingent payment liabilities recorded in the balance sheet. We paid $5.0 million in June 2016 related to the GSK Agreement. Had the specified criteria for payment not been met, or been met in a period different from our expectation, there could have been significant fluctuation in our financial results in future periods.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize share-based compensation expense related to stock options granted based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting share-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the share-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards, however, the fair value of the stock options granted to non-employees is remeasured each reporting period until the service is complete, and the resulting increase or decrease in value, if any, is recognized as expense or income, respectively, during the period the related services are rendered.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, which are used to determine the fair value of share-based awards. These assumptions include:\nExpected Term. The expected term represents the period that our share-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term).\nExpected Volatility. Because we do not have an extended trading history for our common shares, the expected volatility is estimated using weighted average measures of implied volatility and the historical volatility of our peer group of companies for a period equal to the expected life of the stock options. Our peer group of publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies was chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rates paid on securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the stock options.\nExpected Dividend. We have never paid, and do not anticipate paying, cash dividends on our common shares. Therefore, the expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero.\nA significant component of total share-based compensation expense relates to the RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSL, RSG and RSI employees. For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded share-based compensation expense of $5.4 million, $10.9 million and $53.4 million, respectively, in relation to the RSL common share awards and RSL stock options issued by RSL to RSL, RSG and RSI employees. These share-based compensation amounts include compensation expense for BVC awards prior to the BVC Merger on December 4, 2015. Share-based compensation expense is allocated to us by RSL based upon the relative percentage of time utilized by RSL, RSG and RSI employees on our matters. Prior to the BVC Merger, we recorded share-based compensation expense, in relation to the share-based awards issued by BVC to RSI employees based on the changes in fair value of BVC share-based awards. As these BVC share-based awards were not based on our or RSL's shares, they were remeasured at each reporting period date until performance was completed. As a result of the BVC Merger, all outstanding BVC share-based awards were converted into RSL common share awards, with the same vesting and forfeiture terms as the original grant. The RSL common share awards and RSL options are fair valued on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. At the time of the BVC Merger on December 4, 2015, the unvested BVC awards that were converted into common shares of RSL were remeasured at the estimated fair value of RSL and that fair value is recognized over the remaining requisite service period. On December 8, 2015 following the BVC Merger, RSL had a recapitalization in conjunction with a private financing.\nThe RSL common share awards are valued at fair value on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. As a result of the BVC Merger, the converted BVC awards will not be remeasured prospectively. The estimated fair value of these RSL common share awards was determined by the valuation of the December 8, 2015 RSL private financing. Prior to the BVC Merger, the fair value of BVC awards was based on RSL's valuation after considering the fair value of RSL's ownership interest in us and RSL's other investments, discounted cash flow analysis, transactions entered into and contemplated by RSL and relevant industry and comparable public company data. As RSL is a non-public entity, therefore the BVC awards prior to the BVC Merger and the RSL common share awards following the BVC Merger are classified as Level 3 due to their unobservable nature. Significant judgment and estimates were used to estimate the fair value of these awards and options, as they are not publicly traded. RSL common share awards and RSL options are subject to specified vesting schedules and requirements (a mix of time-based and performance-based events). The fair value is based on various corporate event-based considerations, including targets for RSL's post-IPO market capitalization and future financing events. The fair value of each RSL option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes closed-form option-pricing model.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical study costs are accrued over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. Payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product and payments for milestones achieved prior to regulatory approval of the product are expensed in the period incurred as research and development. Milestone payments made in connection with regulatory approvals are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the remaining useful life of the asset. Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred and primarily consist of the intellectual property and research and development materials acquired from GSK and Arena, certain costs charged by RSI and RSG under their services agreements with us, ASI and ASG and expenses from third parties who conduct research and development activities on our behalf. We expense in-process research and development projects acquired as asset acquisitions which have not reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded when, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, it is not more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realizable. When uncertain tax positions exist, we recognize the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. When and if we were to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, they would be reported in tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in the fields of neurology and psychiatry. We are developing a pipeline of clinical and nonclinical product candidates that focuses on the various aspects of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, LBD, and other indications in the fields of neurology and psychiatry. Our goal is to be the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the fields of neurology and psychiatry.\nOur near-term focus is to develop our gene therapy product candidate, AXO-Lenti-PD, as a one-time treatment for Parkinson's disease. We intend to begin a Phase 1/2 study of AXO-Lenti-PD in advanced Parkinson's disease patients before the end of 2018. Prior to the recent in-licensing of AXO-Lenti-PD in June 2018, our primary focus has been on developing nelotanserin, a selective inverse agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, and intepirdine, an antagonist of the 5-HT6 receptor. In January 2018, we announced the results of a pilot Phase 2 Visual Hallucination study of nelotanserin in patients with LBD. We plan to make a determination of the overall development strategy for nelotanserin once we have reviewed final data from our currently ongoing Phase 2 study of nelotanserin in REM Sleep Behavior Disorder and have completed our ongoing comprehensive clinical, regulatory and commercial review. In addition, we will determine our development plans for RVT-104, a combination of rivastigmine and a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist, as a potential treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease or DLB, once we have completed our ongoing comprehensive clinical, regulatory and commercial review in the context of our recent acquisition of AXO-Lenti-PD and any other newly acquired assets.\nIn January 2018, we announced the discontinuation of our development of intepirdine following our announcement that neither Phase 2b HEADWAY clinical trial of intepirdine in patients with DLB nor the pilot Phase 2 Gait and Balance clinical trial of intepirdine in patients with dementia and gait impairment met their respective primary endpoints and the September 2017 announcement that our Phase 3 MINDSET clinical trial of intepirdine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease did not meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints. Following the announcement of Phase 3 MINDSET clinical trial results, we also discontinued further development of RVT-103 which had been intended for use in combination with intepirdine.\nWe have determined that we have one operating and reporting segment.\nWe were founded in October 2014 and our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, acquiring our product candidates and advancing our lead product candidates, intepirdine and nelotanserin, into clinical development. In June 2015, we completed our IPO, from which we raised net proceeds of $334.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In February 2017, we and our subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules, from which we raised net proceeds of $53.5 million. In April 2017, we completed a follow-on public offering of our common shares, from which we raised net proceeds of approximately $134.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. On June 5, 2018, we entered into a share purchase agreement with RSL, our majority shareholder, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to RSL 14,285,714 common shares at a purchase price of $1.75 per common share in a private placement for expected aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $25 million. The share purchase agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Closing of this private placement is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the lapse of a 20-day period following the mailing by us of an information statement relating to the private placement to our shareholders. The anticipated net proceeds from this private placement, together with the proceeds raised to date, are intended to fund our existing planned clinical development programs, the clinical development of AXO-Lenti-PD as well as additional business development activities, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue and we recorded net losses of $221.6 million, $181.0 million and $133.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur products in development, their stage of development, their mechanism of action and the indications for which they are intended to address are described in more detail in the section titled Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOxford BioMedica License Agreement\nOn June 5, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ASG, entered into the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, pursuant to which we received a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Oxford BioMedica to develop and commercialize AXO-Lenti-PD and related gene therapy products for all diseases and conditions. As partial consideration for the license, we will make an upfront payment to Oxford BioMedica of $30.0 million, $5.0 million of which will be applied as a credit against the process development work and clinical supply that Oxford BioMedica will provide to us. Under the terms of the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, we could be obligated to make payments to Oxford BioMedica totaling up to $55.0 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones and $757.5 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and sales milestones. We will also be obligated to pay Oxford BioMedica a tiered royalty from 7% to 10%, based on yearly aggregate net sales of the Gene Therapy Products, subject to specified reductions upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the Oxford BioMedica Agreement. These royalties are required to be paid, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest to occur of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product in such country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country, or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.\nWe are solely responsible, at our expense, for all activities related to the development and commercialization of the Gene Therapy Products. Pursuant to the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize a Gene Therapy Product in the United States and at least one major market country in Europe. In addition, we are required to meet certain diligence milestones and to include at least one U.S.-based clinical trial site in a pivotal study of a Gene Therapy Product. If we fail to meet any of these specified development milestones, we may cure such failure by paying Oxford BioMedica certain fees, which range from $0.5 million to $1.0 million.\nArena Development Agreement for Nelotanserin\nIn October 2015, we exercised an option to acquire global rights, title, interest and obligations in and to nelotanserin from our majority shareholder, RSL. In May 2015, RSL entered into a development, marketing and supply agreement for nelotanserin with Arena and we entered into a Waiver and Option Agreement with RSL. Upon the exercise of our option, we assumed RSL's rights and obligations under the Arena Development Agreement, as amended October 18, 2017. In January 2018, we were notified by Arena that it has assigned all of its rights and obligations under the Arena Development Agreement to an affiliate, 125 Royalty Inc. Under the Waiver and Option Agreement, we recorded $5.3 million as research and development expense, which was 110% of any payments made to Arena by RSL, and any costs incurred by RSL in connection with the development of nelotanserin. We will be responsible for future contingent payments under the Arena Development Agreement, including up to $4.0 million in potential development milestone payments, up to $37.5 million in potential regulatory milestone payments and up to $60.0 million in potential commercial milestone payments. Under the Arena Development Agreement, we are also obligated to purchase all commercial supplies of nelotanserin from Arena for a fixed price equal to 15% of net sales of nelotanserin.\nThe Arena Development Agreement will remain in effect until terminated: (1) by the parties' mutual agreement; (2) for any reason by us upon 90 days' written notice to Arena; (3) by either party upon written notice for the other party's material breach or insolvency event if such party fails to cure such breach or the insolvency event is not dismissed within the specified cure period; or (4) by Arena if we or our affiliates participate in a challenge to certain Arena patents.\nServices Agreements with Roivant Sciences, Inc. and Roivant Sciences GmbH\nIn October 2014, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, ASI, entered into a services agreement with RSI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RSL, or the services agreement, pursuant to which RSI provides us with services in relation to the identification of potential product candidates and project management of clinical trials, as well as other services related to our development, administrative and financial functions. In February 2017, in connection with the contribution and assignment of all of our intellectual property rights to ASG, we amended and restated this services agreement effective as of December 13, 2016, as a result of which ASG was added as a recipient of services from RSI. In addition, ASG also entered into a separate services agreement with RSG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RSL, effective as of December 13, 2016, for the provision of services by RSG to ASG in relation to the identification of potential product candidates and project management of clinical trials, as well as other services related to development, administrative and financial activities. Under the terms of both services agreements, we are obligated to pay or reimburse RSI and RSG for the costs they, or third parties acting on their behalf, incur in providing services to us, ASI or ASG, including administrative and support services as well as research and development services. In addition, we are obligated to pay to RSI and RSG at a pre-determined mark-up on the costs incurred directly by RSI and RSG in connection with any general and administrative and research and development services provided directly by RSI and RSG.\nFor the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred expenses of $8.5 million, $7.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively, inclusive of the mark-up, under the services agreements. We have recorded these charges as research and development expense and general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nRoivant Financing\nOn June 5, 2018, we entered into a share purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with RSL, our majority shareholder, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to RSL 14,285,714 common shares at a purchase price of $1.75 per common share in a private placement (the Private Placement\u201d), equal to the per share closing price of our common shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 5, 2018. The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Closing of the Private Placement is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the lapse of a 20-day period following the mailing by us of an information statement relating to the Private Placement to our shareholders. As of March 31, 2018, RSL held 69.6% of our outstanding common shares.\nThe aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Private Placement are expected to be approximately $25.0 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement to fund the clinical development of AXO-Lenti-PD as well as additional business development activities, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nLoan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc.\nOn February 2, 2017, we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries AHL, ASG and ASI entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules as agent and lender, which was amended on May 24 and September 22, 2017. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we, AHL and ASG, as the borrowers, borrowed an aggregate of $55.0 million at the closing. On May 24, 2017, the Loan Agreement was amended such that the required minimum amount of unrestricted cash applied commencing on July 1, 2017 and is equal to the lesser of (i) $35.0 million (the Applicable Amount\u201d) plus certain aged accounts payable amounts (as further defined in the Loan Agreement) and (ii) the outstanding amount of debt under the Loan Agreement plus certain aged accounts payable (as further defined in the Loan Agreement), provided that the Applicable Amount may be lowered to $30 million upon the achievement of certain clinical milestones as set forth in the Loan Agreement.\nASI issued a guaranty of the borrowers' obligations under the Loan Agreement and, at the closing, paid Hercules a facility charge of $550,000. The Term Loan bears interest at a variable per annum rate calculated for any day as the greater of either (i) the prime rate plus 6.80%, and (ii) 10.55%. Debt issuance fees paid to Hercules were recorded as a discount on the debt and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Loan Agreement. The Term Loan has a scheduled maturity date of March 1, 2021. The borrowers are obligated to make monthly payments of accrued interest under the Loan Agreement until September 1, 2018, followed by monthly installments of principal and interest through March 1, 2021. The interest-only period may be extended until either March 2019 or September 2019 if, in each case, we achieve certain clinical development milestones, as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The borrowers' obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first position lien on substantially all of their and ASI's respective assets, excluding intellectual property. Prepayment of the Term Loan is subject to penalty.\nIn connection with the entry into the Loan Agreement, we issued a warrant to Hercules, which was exercisable for an aggregate of 274,086 of our common shares at an exercise price of $12.04 per share. In August 2017, Hercules exercised the warrant on a cashless basis and received a net issuance of 129,827 of our common shares.\nThe Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants and representations and warranties, including a minimum cash covenant, a covenant against the occurrence of a change in control,\u201d financial reporting obligations, and certain limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), collateral, transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes, and deposit accounts. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, the occurrence of certain events that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect\u201d as set forth in the Loan Agreement, cross acceleration to the debt and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. As of March 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its covenants and obligations under the Loan Agreement.\nIn addition, for so long as the Term Loan remains outstanding, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to afford Hercules the opportunity to participate in future underwritten equity offerings of our common shares up to a total of $3.0 million.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue from the sale of any products, and we do not expect to generate any revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and begin to commercialize one of our product candidates in development.\nResearch and Development Expense\nSince our inception, our operations have primarily been focused on organizing and staffing our company; raising capital; and acquiring, preparing for and advancing our product candidates, intepirdine, nelotanserin, RVT-103 and RVT-104, into clinical development. Our research and development expenses include program-specific costs as well as unallocated internal costs.\nProgram-specific costs include:\n \u2022 direct third-party costs, which include expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and contract manufacturing organizations, the cost of consultants who assist with the development of our product candidates on a program-specific basis, investigator grants, sponsored research, manufacturing costs in connection with producing materials for use in conducting nonclinical and clinical studies, and any other third-party expenses directly attributable to the development of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 upfront payments for the purchase of in-process research and development, which include costs incurred under the GSK Agreement and the Arena Development Agreement.  Unallocated internal costs include:\n \u2022 share-based compensation expense for research and development personnel, including expenses related to RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSI and RSG employees; \n \u2022 personnel-related expenses, which include employee-related expenses, such as salaries, benefits and travel expenses, for research and development personnel; \n \u2022 costs allocated to us under our services agreements with RSI and RSG; and \n \u2022 other expenses, which includes the cost of consultants who assist with our research and development, but are not allocated to a specific program.  Research and development activities will continue to be central to our business model. We expect to continue to incur research and development expense as we wind down our MINDSET, HEADWAY and Gait and Balance trials of intepirdine, and our MINDSET and HEADWAY extension studies, and continue our development program for nelotanserin in LBD. However, due to the termination of the MINDSET, HEADWAY and Gait and Balance trials of intepirdine, we expect our overall research and development expense to decrease significantly for the foreseeable future until such time as we undertake additional development programs, including in relation to additional product candidates we may in-license or acquire as we pursue our updated business plan. We also expect our share-based compensation and other employee-related expenses for our research and development personnel to decrease as a result of the recent reduction in headcount. For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the majority of our research and development expenses have been associated with advancing intepirdine. Our share-based compensation expense attributable to RSL common share awards has become less variable because of the December 2015 merger of BVC Ltd. ( BVC\u201d) with and into RSL, a transaction we refer to in this report as the BVC Merger. Refer to Note 6 \"Related Party Transactions,\" in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development, such as nelotanserin, generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials.\nThe duration, costs and timing of clinical trials of our products in development and any other product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 the number of trials required for approval; \n \u2022 the per patient trial costs; \n \u2022 the number of patients who participate in the trials; \n \u2022 the number of sites included in the trials; \n \u2022 the countries in which the trials are conducted; \n \u2022 the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; \n \u2022 the number of doses that patients receive; \n \u2022 the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; \n \u2022 the potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; \n \u2022 the duration of patient follow-up; \n \u2022 the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals; and \n \u2022 the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidates.  In addition, the probability of success of our products in development and any other product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval of our product candidates for any indication in any country. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine in advance the duration and completion costs of any clinical trial we conduct, or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our products in development or other product candidates, if at all.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, legal and accounting fees, consulting services, services received under the services agreements and employee-related expenses, such as employee salaries and benefits and travel expenses for general and administrative personnel.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will decrease for the foreseeable future, primarily as the result of a recent reduction in share-based compensation and other employee-related expenses for our general and administrative personnel due to the recent reduction in headcount.\nResults of Operations for the

clinical studies and related wind down activities, $18.9 million related to nelotanserin, share-based compensation of $16.6 million, personnel-related expenses of $15.4 million and other unallocated costs of $5.1 million. The share-based compensation expense includes $4.3 million related to the RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSI and RSG employees.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $6.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, as personnel-related expenses increased by $5.9 million resulting from increased headcount, employee severance and other personnel benefits and other expenses increased by $3.4 million due primarily to increased expenses for consultants. Program-specific costs increased by $0.2 million, as expenses related to intepirdine decreased by $6.9 million due to the recent discontinuation of our development program for intepirdine, partially offset by a $6.6 million increase in expenses related to nelotanserin.\nResearch and development expenses were $134.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, and consisted primarily of $87.1 million related to intepirdine, share-based compensation expense of $19.2 million, $12.3 million related to nelotanserin, and personnel-related expenses of $9.4 million. Share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 includes share-based compensation expense of $9.2 million related to the RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSI and RSG employees.\nResearch and development expenses increased $58.1 million in the year ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in direct third-party costs of $71.1 million primarily related to our MINDSET study for intepirdine as a result of increased patient enrollment, offset by decreases in purchases of in-process research and development of $5.3 million and share-based compensation of $11.4 million. Personnel-related expenses increased $4.7 million due to higher headcount, while expenses under our services agreements decreased primarily due to a decrease in research and development services provided by RSI on our behalf.\nResearch and development expenses were $76.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, and consisted primarily of share-based compensation of $30.6 million, $28.0 million related to intepirdine and $7.5 million related to nelotanserin including $5.3 million for the acquisition of nelotanserin. Share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 includes share-based compensation expense of $19.3 million related to the RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSI and RSG employees.\nOn December 4, 2015, BVC, a non-public entity, which held a non-controlling ownership interest in RSL, our majority shareholder, was merged with and into RSL, with RSL as the surviving entity. The compensation amounts of $19.3 million include share-based compensation expense for BVC awards issued to RSI employees prior to the BVC Merger. Prior to the BVC Merger, we recorded share-based compensation expense, in relation to the share-based awards issued by BVC to RSI employees based on the changes in fair value of BVC share-based awards. As these BVC share based awards were not based on our or RSL's shares, they were remeasured at each reporting period date until performance was completed.\nAs a result of the BVC Merger, all outstanding BVC share-based awards were converted into RSL common share awards, with the same vesting and forfeiture terms as the original grant. The RSL common share awards are fair valued on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. At the time of the BVC Merger on December 4, 2015, the unvested BVC awards that were converted into common shares of RSL were remeasured at the estimated fair value of RSL and that fair value is recognized over the remaining requisite service period. On December 8, 2015 following the BVC Merger, RSL had a recapitalization in conjunction with a private financing.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $71.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2018, and consisted of personnel expenses of $22.6 million, share-based compensation expense of $15.3 million, general operating costs of $11.9 million, marketing expenses of $9.3 million, professional fees of $7.0 million and direct and indirect costs of $5.8 million allocated to us under the services agreements. The share-based compensation expense includes $1.1 million for RSL common share awards and RSL options issued to RSI and RSG employees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $26.2 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, as personnel-related expenses increased by $14.6 million resulting from increased headcount, employee severance and other personnel benefits, marketing expenses increased by $4.8 million related to pre-commercial launch activities and general operating costs increased by $5.8 million primarily due to increases in rent, amortization of leasehold improvements, consulting fees and travel associated with increased headcount.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $45.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, and consisted primarily of share-based compensation expense of $17.2 million, personnel-related expenses of $7.9 million, professional fees of $5.0 million, $5.0 million of expenses under our services agreements and marketing expenses of $4.5 million. The share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 includes $1.6 million for RSL common share awards and RSL options issued to RSI and RSG employees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $10.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation of $24.6 million, partially offset by an increase in personnel-related expenses of $4.2 million resulting from higher headcount and an increase in legal and professional fees of $3.0 million. In addition, expenses under our services agreements increased $2.5 million due to an increase in the general and administrative support services provided by RSI on our behalf and marketing expenses increased $1.9 million as a result of pre-commercial launch activities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $56.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 and consisted primarily of share-based compensation of $41.8 million and employee salaries and related benefits, legal and professional fees, and direct and indirect costs allocated to us under the services agreement. The share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 includes $34.1 million for RSL common share awards and RSL options issued to RSI employees. These compensation amounts include share-based compensation expense for BVC awards issued to RSI employees prior to the BVC Merger. Prior to the BVC Merger we recorded share-based compensation expense in relation to the share-based awards issued by BVC to RSI employees based on the changes in fair value of share-based awards which were remeasured at each reporting period date until performance was completed as discussed above.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $7.5 million and $1.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively, consisting of interest paid and the amortization of debt discount related to the Loan Agreement with Hercules.\nThere was no interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had cash totaling $154.3 million. In April 2017, we raised net proceeds of approximately $134.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, from the sale of 7,753,505 common shares in a follow-on public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 that we filed with the SEC in December 2016. The registration statement permits for the offer and sale from time to time of up to $750.0 million of any combination of registered common shares, preferred shares, debt securities and warrants.\nRoivant Financing\nOn June 5, 2018, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with RSL, our majority shareholder, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to RSL 14,285,714 common shares at a purchase price of $1.75 per common share in the Private Placement, equal to the per share closing price of our common shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 5, 2018. The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Closing of the Private Placement is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the lapse of a 20-day period following the mailing by us of an information statement relating to the Private Placement to our shareholders. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Private Placement are expected to be approximately $25.0 million.\nLoan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc.\nOn February 2, 2017, we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, AHL, ASG, and ASI, entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, as agent and lender. The loan and security agreement was amended on May 24 and September 22, 2017 and is referred to herein, as amended, as the Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we, AHL and ASG, as the borrowers, borrowed an aggregate of $55.0 million, or the Term Loan, at the closing. ASI issued a guaranty of the borrowers' obligations under the Loan Agreement, and at the closing, we paid Hercules a facility charge of $550,000. On May 24, 2017, the Loan Agreement was amended such that the required minimum amount of unrestricted cash applied commencing on July 1, 2017 and is equal to the lesser of (i) the $35.0 million Applicable Amount plus certain aged accounts payable amounts (as further defined in the Loan Agreement) and (ii) the outstanding amount of debt under the Loan Agreement plus certain aged accounts payable (as further defined in the Loan Agreement), provided that the Applicable Amount may be lowered to $30 million upon the achievement of certain clinical milestones as set forth in the Loan Agreement.\nThe Term Loan bears interest at a variable per annum rate calculated for any day as the greater of either (i) the prime rate plus 6.80%, and (ii) 10.55%. The Term Loan has a scheduled maturity date of March 1, 2021. The borrowers are obligated to make monthly payments of accrued interest under the Loan Agreement until September 1, 2018, followed by monthly installments of principal and interest through March 1, 2021. The borrowers' obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first position lien on substantially all of their and ASI's respective assets, other than intellectual property. If we prepay the loan prior to March 1, 2021, we will be obligated to pay Hercules a prepayment charge, based on a percentage of the then-outstanding principal balance, equal to 3.0% if the prepayment occurs within the first 18 months following February 2, 2017, 2.0% if the prepayment occurs after 18 months but prior to 36 months following February 2, 2017, and 1.0% if the prepayment occurs thereafter.\nThe Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants and representations and warranties, including a minimum cash covenant, a covenant against the occurrence of a change in control,\u201d financial reporting obligations, and certain limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), collateral, transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes, and deposit accounts. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, the occurrence of certain events that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect\u201d as set forth in the Loan Agreement, cross acceleration to the debt and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement.\nIn connection with the Loan Agreement, we issued a warrant to Hercules which was exercisable for an aggregate of 274,086 of our common shares at an exercise price of $12.04 per share. In August 2017, Hercules exercised the warrant on a cashless basis and received a net issuance of 129,827 of our common shares.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, we used $190.3 million and $4.3 million of cash in our operating and investing activities, respectively. For the year ended March 31, 2017, we used $112.1 million and $0.1 million of cash in our operating and investing activities, respectively. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses at least for the next several years. We do not expect to generate revenue unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one of our products in development. Our cash utilization may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our planned clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expenses as we:\n \u2022 initiate clinical development of AXO-Lenti-PD for advanced Parkinson's disease, including our planned Phase 1/2 trial; \n \u2022 continue the clinical development of nelotanserin for LBD and other indications; \n \u2022 continue the clinical development of RVT-104, a combination of a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist and high-dose rivastigmine; \n \u2022 wind down the MINDSET, HEADWAY and Gait and Balance trials for intepirdine; \n \u2022 continue open-label extension studies for patients completing our nelotanserin phase 2 studies; \n \u2022 seek to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize additional product candidates; \n \u2022 integrate acquired technologies into a comprehensive regulatory and product development strategy; \n \u2022 achieve milestones under our agreements with third parties that will require us to make substantial payments to those parties; \n \u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 hire and retain scientific, clinical, regulatory, manufacturing, quality control, commercial and administrative personnel; \n \u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development efforts; \n \u2022 seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \n \u2022 scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize our product candidates; \n \u2022 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure for drug candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and \n \u2022 operate as a public company.  Our primary use of cash is to fund the research and development of our product candidates. We believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our existing funds will not be sufficient to enable us to complete all necessary development and to commercially launch all of our products. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financing, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products or potentially discontinue operations.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from sales of our products in development, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and potential collaboration, license or development agreements. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds other than our Loan Agreement with Hercules. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders' ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our shareholders' rights. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for each of the periods shown (in thousands):\nTable 297: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(190,348\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(112,109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53,347\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(4,284\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(105\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,346\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>136,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities consist of net loss adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and share-based compensation expense, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $190.3 million and was primarily attributable to a net loss of $221.6 million, partially offset by $31.9 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $112.1 million and was primarily attributable to a net loss of $181.0 million, partially offset by $36.4 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense and increases of $26.5 million in accrued expenses and $7.9 million in accounts payable.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $53.3 million and was primarily attributable to a net loss of $133.1 million which includes costs incurred for research and development activities, including CRO fees, manufacturing, regulatory and other clinical trial costs and our general and administrative expenses, partially offset by $72.4 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $4.3 million, consisting of purchases of leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $0.1 million, consisting of purchases of computer equipment.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $5.3 million primarily for the payment made to RSL for nelotanserin.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $136.4 million, primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $134.5 million received from the sale of 7,753,505 common shares in a follow-on public offering.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $48.5 million, primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $53.5 million from our debt financing from Hercules, offset by the deferred payment of $5.0 million made under the terms of the GSK Agreement in June 2016.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $334.9 million, which was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $334.5 million from the IPO of our common shares.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the SEC's rules. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not subject to off-balance sheet risks.\nContractual Obligations\nOur long-term contractual obligations include commitments and estimated purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business. We have entered into commitments under the Arena Development Agreement, the license agreement with Qaam, the services agreements with RSI and RSG and subleases with RSI and agreements with third parties for office space. In addition, we have entered into various services agreements with third parties for pharmaceutical manufacturing and research activities. The manufacturing agreements can be terminated by us with 30 days written notice. We expect to enter into other commitments as the business further develops.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, we entered into two subleases with RSI for office space in New York, NY. Under the terms of the subleases, RSI paid rent obligations directly pursuant to a master lease, and then invoiced us based on our proportionate share of the space and overhead expenses, calculated based upon the relative numbers of full-time equivalent employees located on the premises. As a result, our rent obligations under these subleases were not fixed. For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred $0.9 million, $1.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in rent and shared office expense under this arrangement with RSI. In June 2017, we also entered into a license agreement for office space in New York, New York, under which we have remaining rent obligations of $0.9 million through January 2019. The Company ceased incurring rent expense under this arrangement with RSI after entering into the June 2017 license agreement for office space.\nAs of March 31, 2018, we did not have any ongoing material financial commitments, other than pursuant to the Arena Development Agreement, Loan Agreement and agreements to rent office space. As described in this report, we previously accrued $5.0 million as research and development expense for a contingent payment liability under the GSK Agreement. We paid this amount to GSK in June 2016.\nThe following table provides information with respect to contractual obligations as of March 31, 2018:\nTable 298: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations (in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Under 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>11,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent obligations (2)\n</td> <td>959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) estimated using interest rate in effect at March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) net of prepayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our financial statements, refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Significant estimates include assumptions used in the determination of some of our costs incurred under our services agreements with RSG and RSI, which costs are charged to research and development and general and administrative expense, as well as assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our common shares and stock awards. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe define our critical accounting policies as those under U.S. GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Not all of these significant accounting policies, however, require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates.\u201d We have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and we believe that our estimates relating to contingent payment liabilities, share-based compensation, research and development accruals and income taxes described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, and are critical accounting estimates.\u201d\nContingent Payment Liability\nOne significant estimate relates to the probability and timing of contingent payment liabilities recorded in the balance sheet. We paid $5.0 million in June 2016 related to the GSK Agreement. Had the specified criteria for payment not been met, or been met in a period different from our expectation, there could have been significant fluctuation in our financial results in future periods.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize share-based compensation expense related to stock options granted based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting share-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the share-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards, however, the fair value of the stock options granted to non-employees is remeasured each reporting period until the service is complete, and the resulting increase or decrease in value, if any, is recognized as expense or income, respectively, during the period the related services are rendered.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, which are used to determine the fair value of share-based awards. These assumptions include:\nExpected Term. The expected term represents the period that our share-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term).\nExpected Volatility. Because we do not have an extended trading history for our common shares, the expected volatility is estimated using weighted average measures of implied volatility and the historical volatility of our peer group of companies for a period equal to the expected life of the stock options. Our peer group of publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies was chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rates paid on securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the stock options.\nExpected Dividend. We have never paid, and do not anticipate paying, cash dividends on our common shares. Therefore, the expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero.\nA significant component of total share-based compensation expense relates to the RSL common share awards and RSL options issued by RSL to RSL, RSG and RSI employees. For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded share-based compensation expense of $5.4 million, $10.9 million and $53.4 million, respectively, in relation to the RSL common share awards and RSL stock options issued by RSL to RSL, RSG and RSI employees. These share-based compensation amounts include compensation expense for BVC awards prior to the BVC Merger on December 4, 2015. Share-based compensation expense is allocated to us by RSL based upon the relative percentage of time utilized by RSL, RSG and RSI employees on our matters. Prior to the BVC Merger, we recorded share-based compensation expense, in relation to the share-based awards issued by BVC to RSI employees based on the changes in fair value of BVC share-based awards. As these BVC share-based awards were not based on our or RSL's shares, they were remeasured at each reporting period date until performance was completed. As a result of the BVC Merger, all outstanding BVC share-based awards were converted into RSL common share awards, with the same vesting and forfeiture terms as the original grant. The RSL common share awards and RSL options are fair valued on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. At the time of the BVC Merger on December 4, 2015, the unvested BVC awards that were converted into common shares of RSL were remeasured at the estimated fair value of RSL and that fair value is recognized over the remaining requisite service period. On December 8, 2015 following the BVC Merger, RSL had a recapitalization in conjunction with a private financing.\nThe RSL common share awards are valued at fair value on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. As a result of the BVC Merger, the converted BVC awards will not be remeasured prospectively. The estimated fair value of these RSL common share awards was determined by the valuation of the December 8, 2015 RSL private financing. Prior to the BVC Merger, the fair value of BVC awards was based on RSL's valuation after considering the fair value of RSL's ownership interest in us and RSL's other investments, discounted cash flow analysis, transactions entered into and contemplated by RSL and relevant industry and comparable public company data. As RSL is a non-public entity, therefore the BVC awards prior to the BVC Merger and the RSL common share awards following the BVC Merger are classified as Level 3 due to their unobservable nature. Significant judgment and estimates were used to estimate the fair value of these awards and options, as they are not publicly traded. RSL common share awards and RSL options are subject to specified vesting schedules and requirements (a mix of time-based and performance-based events). The fair value is based on various corporate event-based considerations, including targets for RSL's post-IPO market capitalization and future financing events. The fair value of each RSL option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes closed-form option-pricing model.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical study costs are accrued over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. Payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product and payments for milestones achieved prior to regulatory approval of the product are expensed in the period incurred as research and development. Milestone payments made in connection with regulatory approvals are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the remaining useful life of the asset. Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred and primarily consist of the intellectual property and research and development materials acquired from GSK and Arena, certain costs charged by RSI and RSG under their services agreements with us, ASI and ASG and expenses from third parties who conduct research and development activities on our behalf. We expense in-process research and development projects acquired as asset acquisitions which have not reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded when, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, it is not more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realizable. When uncertain tax positions exist, we recognize the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. When and if we were to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, they would be reported in tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations."}
