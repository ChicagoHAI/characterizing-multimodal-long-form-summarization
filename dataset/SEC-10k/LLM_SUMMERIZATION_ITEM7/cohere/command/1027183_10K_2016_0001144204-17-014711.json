Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral. First South Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company\") was formed to issue common stock, owning 100% of First South Bank (the \"Bank\") and operating through the Bank a commercial banking business; therefore, this discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operation relates primarily to the Bank. The Company's common stock is listed and trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol FSBK.\nThe business of the Bank consists principally of attracting deposits from the general public and using them to originate secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans, permanent mortgage and construction loans secured by single-family residences and other loans and leases. The Bank's earnings depend primarily on its net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The Bank's earnings are also impacted by the volume of non-interest income generated and non-interest expenses incurred.\nPrevailing economic conditions, competition, as well as federal and state regulations, affect the operations of the Bank. The Bank's cost of funds is influenced by interest rates offered on deposits by other financial institutions in the Bank's market area and by general market interest rates. Lending activities are affected by the demand for financing of real estate and various types of commercial, consumer and mortgage loans, and by the interest rates offered on such financing. The Bank's business emphasis is to operate as a well-capitalized, profitable and independent community oriented financial institution dedicated to providing quality customer service and meeting the financial needs of the communities it serves. The Bank believes it has been effective in serving its customers because of its ability to respond quickly and effectively to customer needs and inquiries.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources. Liquidity generally refers to the Bank's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its funding needs. Adequate liquidity guarantees sufficient funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals, fund loan commitments, maintain adequate reserve requirements, pay operating expenses, provide funds for debt service, and meet other general commitments. The Bank maintains its liquidity position under policy guidelines based on liquid assets in relationship to deposits and short-term borrowings. The Bank's primary sources of funds are customer deposits, loan principal and interest payments, proceeds from loan and securities sales, as well as access to wholesale funding sources such as advances from the FHLB of Atlanta and brokered certificates of deposit. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are influenced by interest rates, economic conditions and local competition. The Bank's primary investing activity is originating commercial, consumer and mortgage loans, lease financing receivables and purchases of investment securities. The Bank's primary financing activities are attracting checking, certificate, and savings deposits and obtaining FHLB advances.\nThe levels of cash and cash equivalents depend on the Bank's operating, investing and financing activities during any given period. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $46.2 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $38.0 million at December 31, 2015. The Bank has other sources of liquidity if an immediate need for additional funds arises. Investment securities available for sale, consisting of government agencies, mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities and corporate bonds totaled $192.6 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $248.3 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the Bank also had investment securities held to maturity of $510,000. See Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Bank's operating, investing and financing activities.\nBorrowings consisting of junior subordinated debentures were $10.3 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There were $17.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2016, compared to $37.0 million at December 31, 2015. During 2015, the Bank utilized FHLB borrowings as a source of funds to support loan portfolio growth. The Bank uses FHLB borrowings as a funding source to provide an effective means of managing its overall cost of funds and to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.\nThe Bank has pledged certain loans as collateral for actual or potential FHLB advances. The Bank has credit availability with the FHLB of 25% of the Bank's total assets. The Bank had $246.2 million of credit availability with the FHLB at December 31, 2016, compared to $228.2 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the Bank had lendable collateral value with the FHLB totaling $217.8 million, of which $17.0 million had been utilized to secure outstanding advances. Additional collateral would be required in order to access total borrowings up to the credit availability limit. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had pledged $139.7 million of loans as collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, which provided the Bank with $98.8 million of borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window. In addition, at December 31, 2016, the Company and Bank had available contingency funding sources of $5.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively, of pre-approved but unused lines of credit. See Notes 1 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nJunior subordinated debentures totaling $10.3 million were outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. They were issued in 2003 through a private placement pooled trust preferred securities offering by First South Preferred Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust. The trust preferred securities bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 2.95% payable quarterly. In December 2014, the Company swapped the interest rate on these debentures to a fixed rate of 5.54% for the ensuing five year period. This strategy was executed to provide the Company with protection in a rising rate environment. During 2016, the Company restructured the terms of this swap to lower the fixed rate cost and extend its maturity. As a result, the restructured fixed rate effective June 30, 2016, is 4.97% and the maturity date of the swap is December 30, 2024. The debentures have a 30-year maturity and were first redeemable, in whole or in part, on or after September 30, 2008, with certain exceptions. For regulatory purposes, $10.0 million of the trust preferred securities qualifies as Tier 1 capital for the Company, and for the Bank, as the Company invested the proceeds in the Bank as additional paid-in capital. Proceeds from the trust preferred securities were used by the statutory trust to purchase junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAs a North Carolina chartered commercial bank and a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC\u201d) insured institution, the Bank is required to meet various federal and state regulatory capital standards. The Bank's total regulatory capital was $96.5 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $88.1 million at December 31, 2015.\nThe FDIC requires the Bank to meet the following minimum capital requirements: total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital and leverage capital. The required minimum capital ratios at December 31, 2016, adjusted for a Basel III 0.625% of risk-weighted assets phase in for capital conservation buffer, are as follows:\nTable 84: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>1. </td> <td>Total capital ratio of 8.625% of risk-weighted assets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>2. </td> <td>Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.625% of risk-weighted assets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>3. </td> <td>Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 5.125% of risk-weighted assets; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>4. </td> <td>Leverage ratio of 4% of average total assets. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank is also subject to the capital requirements of North Carolina banking law, as described in Part I, Item 1. Business - Depository Institution Regulation - North Carolina Capital Requirements and Regulatory Action.\u201d The Bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements at December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Bank's actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nInterest Rate Risk and Asset/Liability Management. Interest rate risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates. The risk of loss can be reflected in diminished and/or reduced potential net interest income in future periods. Interest rate risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit taking activities. The Bank considers interest rate risk to be a significant risk, which could potentially have a material impact on earnings. The Bank measures its exposure to interest rate risk through net interest income simulation ( NII\u201d) and calculating our economic value of equity (\"EVE\"). NII measures the Bank's net interest income given various assumptions under various interest rate scenarios. EVE is derived by calculating the net present value of the cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items given a range of changes in market interest rates. The Bank's exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a quarterly basis by management and the ALCO. If the modeling results regarding net interest income and EVE are not within Board established targeted risk tolerance limits, the Board may direct management to adjust the Bank's asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within acceptable levels.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank strives to maintain a consistent net interest margin and reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates. Factors beyond the Bank's control, such as market interest rates and competition, may also impact interest income and interest expense. Given our level of fixed rate lending, coupled with embedded floors in our floating rate loan portfolio and our level of interest-bearing non-maturity deposits that can reprice immediately, the Bank has potential exposure to a near-term rising interest rate environment, which could result in a net interest margin compression for the Company. Management has taken steps to lessen this exposure by swapping some customer loans from fixed to floating rate, adding defensive investments in the investment portfolio and longer-term fixed rate funding to the balance sheet, including swapping the interest rate on its trust preferred debt to a fixed rate as described above.\nInterest rate risk and trends, liquidity and capital ratios are reported to the ALCO and the Board on a regular basis. The ALCO reviews the maturities of the Bank's assets and liabilities and establishes policies and strategies designed to regulate the flow of funds and to coordinate the sources, uses and pricing of such funds. The first priority in structuring and pricing assets and liabilities is to maintain an acceptable interest rate spread while reducing the net effects of changes in interest rates. The Bank's management is responsible for administering the policies and determinations of the ALCO and the Board with respect to the Bank's asset and liability goals and strategies.\nTable 1 below does not reflect downward rate interest rate projections. Given the current historically low level of interest rates, management and the ALCO are focused on the institution's exposure to a rising rate environment. The Board has adopted an interest rate risk management policy that establishes maximum decreases in EVE of 10%, 20%, 25% and 30%, and a maximum decrease in NII of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, in the event of an immediate 100 to 400 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates.\nTable 1 below presents a static simulation projection of changes in EVE and net interest income in the event of sudden increases in market interest rates for the various rate shock levels at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Bank's estimated changes in EVE and net interest income were within the Board established target limits. The Bank utilizes the services of a third party to assist with its interest rate risk modeling.\nTable 1 - Projected Change in EVE and Net Interest Income\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Economic Value of Portfolio Equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Interest Income </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in Rates </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+ 400 bp </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,622 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+ 300 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+ 200 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169,388 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+ 100 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Base </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in Table 1. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities to repricing, they may react in differing degrees to changes in interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In addition, the proportion of adjustable-rate loans in the Bank's portfolio could decrease in future periods due to refinance activity if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table. Also, the ability of borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in interest rates.\nRate/Volume Analysis. A primary component of managing interest rate risk is based on changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Table 2 below summarizes the changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and their respective average balances during 2016 and 2015. Additionally, depending on market conditions existing at a given time, the Bank may sell fixed-rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. In managing its portfolio of available for sale investment securities, the Bank has the ability to sell securities should a need arise.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume on average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities. Table 2 below represents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Company's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. For each category of average interest-earning asset and average interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to: changes in volume; changes in rate; and total change.\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>Table 2 - Rate/Volume Analysis </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 vs. 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 vs. 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) Due to </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) Due to </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Volume </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Volume </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans receivable </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(733 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,215 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investments and deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,539 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,143 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(412 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total earning assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(337 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,627 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,273 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(161 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Junior subordinated debentures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>239 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total interest-bearing liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>304 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(646 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,775 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,969 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income. Net interest income primarily represents the difference between income derived from interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by both the difference between the yield on earning assets and the average cost of funds (\"interest rate spread\"), and the relative volume and mix of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities as well as noninterest-bearing deposits.\nTable 3 below contains comparative information relating to the Company's average balance sheet for 2016, 2015 and 2014, presented on a tax equivalent yield basis. Tax equivalent yields related to certain investment securities exempt from federal income tax are stated on a fully taxable basis, using a 34% federal tax rate and reduced by a disallowed portion of the tax exempt interest income. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The interest rate spread represents the difference between the tax equivalent yield on average earning assets and the average cost of funds. The tax equivalent net interest margin represents net interest income (tax adjusted basis) divided by average earning assets.\nNet interest income for the year ended 2016 totaled $32.6 million, a $3.2 million or 10.9% increase, from the $29.4 million generated during the comparative year ended 2015. The tax equivalent net interest margin for the year ended 2016 increased to 3.71%, from 3.64% for the prior year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe improvement in the tax-equivalent net interest margin is due to higher volumes of average earning assets and the change in the mix of our earning assets, as we have replaced lower yielding investments with higher yielding loans. On the liability side of the balance sheet, while we continue to seek expansion of our non-maturity deposit base, we have also taken steps to protect the Company from a rising rate environment by utilizing some longer-term funding. We anticipate the level of our current margin remaining somewhat stable over the near-term, unless there are dramatic movements in interest rates.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td>

Earning assets increased to $922.2 million at December 31, 2016, from $878.3 million at December 31, 2015. The ratio of earning assets to total assets was 93.1% at December 31, 2016, compared to 92.8% at December 31, 2015. The increase is attributable to a net increase in the volume of earning assets, resulting primarily from net growth in loans and leases held for investment. This growth was primarily funded by a $59.3 million increase in total deposits coupled with cash flow from the investment securities portfolio.\nInterest-bearing deposits with banks increased to $23.3 million at December 31, 2016, from $18.6 million at December 31, 2015. Overnight deposits are impacted by fluctuations in deposit levels and are available to fund securities purchases, loan originations, deposit withdrawals, liquidity management activities and daily operations of the Bank.\nThe investment securities portfolio totaled $193.1 million at December 31, 2016, versus $248.8 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, there were $9.3 million of purchases, $40.6 million of sales, $21.2 million of principal repayments, a $2.1 million decline in unrealized holding gains, $467,000 of net realized gains and $1.5 million of net accretion of premiums and discounts. The net result of cash flows from scheduled amortization and maturities, as well as the sales of securities, were used primarily to fund growth in loans and leases held for investment. The Bank may make changes in the securities portfolio mix to manage sensitivity to future interest rate changes. See Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTotal loans held for sale increased to $5.1 million at December 31, 2016, from $3.9 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting the net effect of current mortgage lending activity. During 2016, there were $44.3 million of mortgage loan sales, $44.0 million of originations net of principal payments and $1.4 million of net realized gains. See Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal loans and leases held for investment grew by $93.6 million during 2016. As a result of this net growth, total loans and leases held for investment increased to $700.6 million at December 31, 2016, from $607.0 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, there were $94.6 million of originations net of principal payments, $345,000 of charge-offs and $648,000 of transfers to OREO. As a result of the Bank's total loan and total deposit growth during 2016, the loans-to-deposits ratio increased to 81.1% at December 31, 2016, from 75.3% at December 31, 2015.\nThe Bank originates both fixed and adjustable rate secured and unsecured loans held for investment. Adjustable rate loans provide the ability to better manage exposure to market and interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates. The Bank continues to limit the origination of new acquisition and development loans, land loans or speculative lot loans. After successfully reducing its acquisition, development and construction concentration, the Bank has resumed originations, in select markets within its footprint, of speculative and pre-sold construction loans on 1-to-4 family residential properties and construction loans for commercial projects with an emphasis on owner-occupied and preleased non-owner occupied properties.\nAsset quality is a key component of the Bank's short and long-term performance objectives. Loans and leases held for investment on nonaccrual status, including TDRs on nonaccrual status totaled $3.1 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $3.2 million at December 31, 2015. Management and the Board are committed to having strong asset quality, as we believe this is a key driver of stock price performance and overall shareholder value. The ratio of loans and leases on nonaccrual status to total loans and leases improved to 0.44% at December 31, 2016, from 0.53% at December 31, 2015.\nLoans are generally placed on nonaccrual status, and accrued but unpaid interest is reversed, when in management's judgment, it is determined that the collectability of interest, but not necessarily principal, is doubtful. Generally, this occurs when payment is delinquent in excess of 90 days. Consumer loans that have become more than 180 days past due are generally charged off or a specific allowance may be provided for any expected loss. All other loans are charged off when management concludes that they are uncollectible.\nManagement has thoroughly evaluated all nonperforming loans and believes they are either well collateralized or adequately reserved. However, there can be no assurance in the future that regulators, increased volume and risks in the loan portfolio, adverse changes in economic conditions or other factors will not require additional adjustments to the ALLL for these assets. Aside from the loans identified on nonaccrual status, there were no loans at December 31, 2016, where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with their current loan repayment terms. See Notes 1, 4 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe ALLL was $8.7 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $7.9 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting provisions for credit losses and net charge-offs. During 2016, there were $970,000 of provisions for credit losses and $163,000 of net charge-offs. The ratio of the ALLL to loans and leases held for investment was 1.24% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.30% at December 31, 2015. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Lending Activities-Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d and Notes 1 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOREO acquired from foreclosures was reduced to $3.2 million at December 31, 2016, from $6.1 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, there were $3.4 million of disposals, $131,000 of net realized gains, $251,000 of valuation adjustments, net of $648,000 of additions. OREO consists of residential and commercial properties, developed lots and raw land. The Bank believes the adjusted carrying value of these properties is representative of their fair market value, although there are no assurances that ultimate sales will be equal to or greater than the carrying value. See Notes 1, 7 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Bank's investment in bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) increased to $18.1 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $15.6 million at December 31, 2015. The investment returns from BOLI are utilized to offset a portion of the cost of providing benefit plans to certain employees.\nGoodwill was $4.2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is tested for impairment annually. The Company's most recent annual impairment test determined there was no goodwill impairment. Identifiable intangible assets were $1.6 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $1.9 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting the core deposit intangible ( CDI\u201d) associated with a prior period branch acquisition transaction, which is being amortized over a ten year period. See Notes 1 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMSRs increased to $2.1 million at December 31, 2016, from $1.3 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, the Bank purchased the MSRs of 452 high-quality Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans with an unpaid principal balance of $84.6 million. The selection of these mortgage loans to service was based on their quality as well as their geographic location. All of the loans acquired were current as to payment on the purchase date and the Bank had the ability to push-back any loans that prepaid or became delinquent within 90 days. In addition, all of these loans are located in the state of North Carolina and a significant portion of the borrowers reside within the Bank's footprint. Mortgage loans serviced for others increased to $372.0 million at December 31, 2016, from $297.5 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to these acquired loans.\nPrepaid expenses and other assets were $8.4 million at December 31, 2016, versus $8.3 million at December 31, 2015, primarily reflecting changes and adjustments in our deferred tax asset. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Non-Interest Expense below for additional information.\nTotal deposits increased by $59.3 million to $870.6 million at December 31, 2016, from $811.3 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, non-maturity deposits including noninterest bearing accounts, savings accounts and interest bearing demand accounts grew by $27.4 million, $9.7 million and $25.7 million, respectively, and were partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in certificates of deposit. Certificates of deposit represented 29.5% of total deposits at December 31, 2016, compared to 32.1% at December 31, 2015. Noninterest bearing accounts increased to 22.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2016, from 20.9% at December 31, 2015. The Bank strives to manage its cost of deposits through a combination of monitoring the volume and pricing of new and maturing CDs and growth in non-maturity deposits, in relationship to current funding needs and market interest rates. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Interest Expense below for additional information.\nFHLB borrowings declined by $20.0 million to $17.0 million at December 31, 2016, from $37.0 million at December 31, 2015. The Bank uses FHLB borrowings as a funding source to provide an effective means of managing its overall cost of funds and to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. There was $10.3 million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Part I - Item 1. Business-Deposit Activity and Other Sources of Funds-Borrowings\u201d above, and Notes 13 and 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nStockholders' equity increased by $5.0 million to $87.2 million at December 31, 2016, from $82.2 million at December 31, 2015. This increase reflects the $7.0 million of net income earned for the year ended December 31, 2016, net of a $938,000 decline in accumulated other comprehensive income and $1.1 million of cash dividends declared. Accumulated other comprehensive income totaled $1.4 million at December 31, 2016, versus $2.4 million at December 31, 2015. See Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Notes 1 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe growth in equity coupled with a reduction in the Bank's CDI resulted in an increase in tangible equity. As such, the tangible book value per common share increased to $8.576 at December 31, 2016, from $8.02 at December 31, 2015, and the tangible equity to assets ratio increased to 8.21% at December 31, 2016, from 8.04% at December 31, 2015.\nThere were 9,494,935 common shares outstanding at December 31, 2016, compared to 9,489,222 shares outstanding at December 31, 2015, reflecting the effect of 3,475 shares issued pursuant to the vesting of restricted stock awards and 2,238 shares issued pursuant to stock options exercised during 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividend payments. The continued payment of cash dividends reflects the strong capital position of the Company, sound and improved financial performance and our desire to provide additional value to our stockholders. The Board will continue to review the status of future dividend payments, which will depend upon the Company's financial condition, earnings, equity structure, capital needs and economic conditions.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by its federal and state banking regulators. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank's regulatory capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements and the Bank's regulatory capital position was categorized as well capitalized\u201d. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2016, that management believes have changed the Bank's well capitalized\u201d category. See Part I, Item 1. Business - Depository Institution Regulation - Capital Requirements\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d above and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nGeneral. The Company reported a 48.6% increase in net income to $7.0 million for 2016, from $4.7 million for 2015. Net income per diluted common share increased to $0.73 per share for 2016, from $0.49 per share for 2015. The improvement in earnings for 2016 was positively impacted by increases in net interest income and non-interest income, as well as a lower volume of non-interest expense, while being partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses associated with the strong loan portfolio growth. In addition, during the first quarter of 2015, the Bank incurred $425,000 of one-time pre-tax transaction expenses associated with acquiring nine branch offices in mid-December of 2014.\nKey Performance Ratios. Key performance ratios are return on average assets ( ROA\u201d), return on average equity ( ROE\u201d) and efficiency. For 2016, ROA and ROE improved to 0.72% and 8.02%, respectively, from 0.52% and 5.72%, respectively, for 2015. The efficiency ratio (non-interest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus non-interest income) also improved to 76.51% for 2016, from 84.53% for 2015. The efficiency ratio measures the proportion of net operating revenues that are absorbed by overhead expenses. The efficiency ratio was elevated for 2015 due primarily to franchise expansion. We anticipate the efficiency ratio to improve over time as the investments we have made in staffing and infrastructure are able to generate a larger earning asset base and an increased level of earnings.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased to $36.2 million for 2016, from $32.5 million for 2015. The year-over-year growth in interest income is due primarily to changes in the composition and volume of our earning asset base, coupled with an increase in yields on earning assets, as we have replaced lower yielding investments with higher yielding loans. Average earning assets increased during 2016 to $889.6 million, from $822.6 million for 2015, primarily reflecting the strong growth in the level of our loans and leases held for investment during the current year. We have also experienced an increase in yields on earning assets over comparative periods. The tax equivalent yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 4.11% for 2016, from 4.01% for 2015.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $3.6 million for 2016, from $3.1 million for 2015. This change in interest expense was primarily the result of an increased volume of average interest bearing liabilities that were utilized to support earnings asset growth. Interest expense was also impacted by a five basis point increase in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased to $691.6 million for 2016, from $653.1 million for 2015. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased to $177.0 million for 2016, from $158.0 million for 2015. These combined increases reflect the impact of prior period branch acquisitions, as well as organic growth during 2016. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.52% for 2016, from 0.47% for the comparative 2015 annual period. The Bank has strived to manage its funding cost through a combination of growing noninterest bearing demand deposits and lower costing non-maturity deposits. In addition, the Bank has restructured its FHLB advances in order to extend some maturities to provide protection in a rising rate environment and a reduced the interest rate paid on junior subordinated notes. These savings were partially offset by additional cost on the longer-term portion of our CD portfolio.\nEffective December 30, 2014, the Company swapped the interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures from three-month LIBOR plus 2.95%, to a fixed rate of 5.54% for the ensuing five year period. This strategy was executed to provide the Company with protection in the event of a rising rate environment. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company restructured the terms of this swap to lower the fixed rate cost and extend its maturity. As a result, the restructured fixed rate effective as of June 30, 2016, is 4.97% and the maturity date of the swap is December 30, 2024.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended 2016 increased to $32.6 million, a $3.2 million or 10.9% increase, versus the $29.4 million generated during the year ended 2015. The tax equivalent net interest margin for the year ended 2016 increased to 3.71%, from 3.64% for the year ended 2015.\nThe improvement in the tax-equivalent net interest margin is due to higher volumes of average earning assets and the change in the mix of our earning assets, as we have replaced lower yielding investments with higher yielding loans. On the liability side of the balance sheet, while we continue to seek expansion of our non-maturity deposit base, we have also taken steps to protect the Company from a rising rate environment by adding some longer-term funding. We continue to balance our customers' desires to maintain liquidity in their deposit selection with the possibility of a rising rate environment. During 2016, customers have moved more funds into lower cost non-maturity and short-term CD's. We anticipate the level of our current margin remaining somewhat stable over the near-term, unless there are dramatic movements in interest rates. See Table 2 - Rate/Volume Analysis\u201d and Table 3 - Yield/Cost Analysis\u201d above for additional information on interest income, interest expense, net interest income, average balances and yield/cost ratios.\nProvision for Credit Losses. The Bank recorded $970,000 of provisions for credit losses in 2016, compared to $800,000 for 2015. The Bank's methodology for determining its provision for credit losses includes amounts specifically allocated to credits that are individually determined to be impaired, as well as general provisions allocated to groups of loans that have not been individually assessed for impairment. The increase in provision for credit losses is primarily attributable to support the net growth in loans and leases held for investment during 2016, as previously discussed. Provisions for credit losses are necessary to maintain the ALLL at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb probable future losses in the loan portfolio. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Lending Activities-Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d and Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNon-Interest Income. Total non-interest income was $14.2 million for 2016, compared to $14.3 million for 2015. Non-interest income consists of deposit fees and service charges; loan fees and charges; mortgage loan servicing fees; gain on sale and other fees on mortgage loans, gain on sales of investment securities and OREO; and other miscellaneous income. The Bank strives to maintain consistency of its non-interest income earned across both deposit and loan service offerings. Fees and service charges on deposits, and fees on loans and loan servicing fees earned during each period are influenced by the volume of deposits and loans outstanding, the volume of the various types of deposit and loan account transactions processed, the volume of loans serviced for others and the collection of related fees and service charges.\nDeposit fees and service charges, the largest component of non-interest income, totaled $7.6 million for 2016, versus $8.1 million earned in 2015. Deposit fees and service charges represented 53.5% of total non-interest income for 2016, compared to 56.5% for 2015. The amount of service charges and fees is generally dependent upon the volume of account transaction activity and the collection of related service charges and fees. Deposit fees and service charges have been enhanced from historical levels as accounts acquired in the 2014 branch acquisition transaction, as well as from the introduction of new products and product enhancements. We anticipate stable service charge revenue from deposits going forward as we focus on growing our core deposit base through new quality customer relationships.\nThe Bank's mortgage division generates revenues through originations, sales and servicing of mortgage loans. Total non-interest income generated from the sale and servicing of mortgage loans and loan fees increased to $3.6 million in 2013, from $3.1 million for 2015. We anticipate the level of mortgage originations to remain consistent, with the overall economic climate improving in the Bank's market area. The Bank sells the majority of its originated mortgage loans and retains the servicing rights. The Bank may sell or securitize fixed-rate residential mortgage loans to reduce interest rate and credit risk exposure, and to provide a more balanced sensitivity to future interest rate changes, while retaining certain other held for sale mortgage loans for possible future securitization into available for sale mortgage-backed securities.\nThe Bank sold $44.3 million of mortgage loans held for sale in 2016, compared to $34.6 million sold in 2015. Loans serviced for others and MSRs were $372.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016, compared to $297.5 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2015. We will continue to explore various strategies to enhance our non-interest income, including the purchase of MSRs, as previously discussed. The future levels of gains on sales of mortgage loans and loan servicing fees are dependent on the pricing and volume of new mortgage loan originations.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGains from sales of investment securities available for sale were $467,000 for 2016, versus $1.4 million for 2015. As previously noted, in 2014 we implemented a strategy to pre-invest a large portion of the anticipated branch acquisition transaction proceeds into short and intermediate term investment securities, until the funds could be converted to higher yielding assets. The Bank sold $40.6 million of investment securities available for sale in 2016, compared to $46.2 million sold in 2015, primarily to fund our loan portfolio growth.\nIn its continued efforts of disposing of nonperforming assets, the Bank recorded net gains on sales of OREO properties of $131,000 for 2016, compared to $40,000 for 2015. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIncluded in other non-interest income is revenue from BOLI investments of $562,000 for 2016, compared to $510,000 for 2015. The Bank utilizes the investment returns from the BOLI to recover a portion of the cost of providing employee benefit plans.\nOther non-interest income for 2016 includes an increase in SBA related revenue to $520,000 for 2016, from $55,000 for 2015. While the Bank has originated SBA loans in prior years, we only began the process of actively selling and servicing these credits during the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, other income for 2016 includes a $230,000 non-recurring payment to the Bank.\nTotal core non-interest income, excluding net gains and losses from OREO and investment securities sales, increased to $13.6 million for 2016, from $12.8 million for 2015.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Total non-interest expenses for 2016 declined by $473,000 to $35.9 million, from $36.4 million for 2015.\nCompensation and benefits expense, the largest component of non-interest expenses, increased to $19.8 million for 2016, from $19.4 million reported in 2015. During 2016, the Bank consolidated three existing branches into nearby locations, and incurred $65,000 of severance costs associated with these branch consolidations. The Bank will continue to manage staffing levels to ensure we meet the ongoing needs of our customers and to support our future growth.\nPremises and equipment expense increased to $5.5 million for 2016, from $5.3 million reported in 2015. Premises and equipment expense for 2016 includes the retirement of certain leasehold improvements and other fixed assets at the branch locations that were consolidated and closed. We will continue to explore opportunities to gain efficiency and performance improvement from our branch network.\nThe cost of FDIC insurance increased to $632,000 for 2016, from to $609,000 reported in 2015. The increase in FDIC insurance premiums during 2016 was due to the growth in our balance sheet.\nMarketing expense for 2016 declined to $702,000, from $820,000 reported in 2015. The Bank continues to invest in building our brand awareness throughout our expanded footprint with its marketing efforts. We anticipate that marketing expenses will remain at or below current levels as we look to take a more product targeted approach.\nData processing costs for 2016 declined to $3.1 million, from $3.6 million for 2015, as the Bank has renegotiated its contract with its third party processing provider. Data processing expense for 2015 included $173,000 of one-time branch acquisition expenses. Data processing costs fluctuate in conjunction with changes in the number of customer accounts and transaction activity volumes. As we continue to focus on new customer acquisition and to invest in emerging technology to better serve our customer base, we anticipate that data processing costs may increase in support of future growth.\nTotal amortization of intangible assets, including MSRs and identifiable intangible assets, increased to $571,000 for 2016, from $515,000 for 2015. Amortization of MSRs was $287,000 for 2016, compared to $228,000 for 2015, as the Bank purchased additional MSRs mid-way through the current year. Amortization of the Company's CDI, which is the only identifiable intangible asset subject to amortization, was $284,000 for 2016, compared to $287,000 for the 2015. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal expenses attributable to ongoing maintenance, property taxes and insurance and valuation adjustments for OREO properties was reduced to $553,000 for 2016, from $632,000 for 2015. OREO valuation adjustments included therein were $250,000 for 2016, compared to $195,000 for 2015. See Notes 1 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Management continuously analyzes the carrying value of OREO and makes valuation adjustments as necessary.\nOther non-interest expense declined to $5.1 million for 2016, compared to $5.5 million for 2015. As previously discussed, during 2016 the Bank consolidated three existing branches into nearby locations. Two of these locations were leased and the third was owned. During 2016, the Bank entered into a contract to sell the owned location and realized an $85,000 pre-tax loss as a result. Other expense for 2015 included $180,000 of one-time branch acquisition expenses.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense increased to $3.0 million for 2016, from $1.8 million for 2015. Changes in the amount of income tax expense reflect changes in pretax income, deductible expenses, the application of permanent and temporary differences and the applicable income tax rates in effect during each period. Income taxes for 2016 and 2015 includes a $74,000 and $80,000 expense adjustment, respectively, due a write down of our deferred tax asset, as a result of a reduction in the North Carolina statutory tax rates for each respective year. The effective income tax rates were 29.8% for 2016, compared to 28.2% for 2015. The Bank's investment in BOLI and tax-exempt municipal bonds contribute to more favorable effective income tax rates, which has been partially offset by the strong growth in the loan portfolio.\nThe North Carolina State Legislature (the Legislature\u201d) enacted significant tax reform in 2013 for lowering the state's corporate income tax rates. The state corporate income tax rate for 2014 was reduced from 6.9% to 6.0%; was reduced to 5.0% for 2015; was reduced to 4.0% for 2016; and will be reduced to 3.0% for 2017. This reduction in the state income tax rate has favorably impacted the Company's state income tax expense and overall effective tax rates during the past two years.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nGeneral. The Company reported net income of $4.7 million for 2015, compared to $4.1 million for 2014. Net income per diluted common share was $0.49 per share for 2015, compared to $0.42 per share for 2014. Earnings for 2015 were positively impacted by increases in net interest income and non-interest income, as well as lower loan loss provisions, while non-interest expenses increased with the growth of our franchise and supporting infrastructure. The increase in net interest income reflects strong growth in our base of average earning assets during 2015 that was efficiently funded. The growth in non-interest income was driven by enhanced fee income from deposit service offerings as the benefits of a 2014 branch acquisition transaction were realized, coupled with income from our mortgage banking business and gains realized as certain bond positions were sold in support of funding growth in the loan portfolio. Non-interest expenses in 2015 exceeded that of 2014, due primarily to a full year of infrastructure expense added with the acquired branches. In addition, during 2015, the Bank incurred approximately $425,000 of one-time, pre-tax expenses associated with completing the branch acquisition transaction. Pre-tax net income for 2014 reflects the impact of $1.7 million of one-time branch acquisition transaction expenses and the prepayment fee on FHLB advances. Excluding the net effects of these one-time expenses, net income for 2014 would have been $5.0 million, or $0.52 per diluted common share.\nKey Performance Ratios. For 2015, ROA and ROE were 0.52% and 5.72%, respectively, compared to 0.57% and 5.18%, respectively, for 2014. The efficiency ratio was 84.53% for 2015, compared to 79.98% for 2014. The efficiency ratio is elevated for 2015 due primarily to franchise expansion. We anticipate the efficiency ratio to improve over time as the investments we have made in additional staff and infrastructure are able to generate an increased level of earnings. The 2014 key performance ratios were negatively impacted by the branch acquisition transaction expenses and the FHLB prepayment fee.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased to $32.5 million for 2015, from $29.2 million for 2014. The year-over-year growth in interest income is due primarily to changes in the composition and volume of our earning asset base, and partially offset by a decline in yields on earning assets. Average earning assets increased during 2015 to $822.6 million, from $663.6 million for 2014, primarily reflecting the increase in investment securities acquired in the latter half of 2014, coupled with strong growth in the level of our loans and leases held for investment during the current year. The tax equivalent yield on average interest-earning assets declined to 4.01% for 2015, from 4.47% for 2014. While the Company experienced strong loan growth during 2015, given the current low rate environment, yields on new loan production were below historical levels.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $3.1 million for 2015, from $2.8 million for 2014. This change in interest expense was primarily the result of an increased volume of average interest bearing liabilities that were needed to support asset growth. Interest expense benefited from a four basis point reduction in the overall cost of funds in 2015.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased to $653.1 million for 2015, from $541.2 million for 2014. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased to $158.0 million for 2015, from $99.4 million for 2014. These combined increases reflect the impact of the branch acquisition as well as organic growth during 2015. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities improved to 0.47% for 2015, from 0.51% for 2014. The Bank managed its funding cost through a combination of growth in noninterest bearing demand deposits as well as an increase in lower cost non-maturity deposits. In addition, re-structuring of FHLB advances allowed the Bank to lower the overall cost of these funds, while extending some maturities to provide protection in a rising rate environment. These savings were partially offset by additional cost on the longer-term portion of CDs and junior subordinated debentures. Effective December 30, 2014, the Company swapped the interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures from three-month LIBOR plus 2.95%, to a fixed rate of 5.54% for the ensuing five year period. This strategy was executed to provide the Company with protection in the event of a rising rate environment.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended 2015 improved to $29.4 million, a $3.0 million or 11.2% increase, from the $26.4 million generated during the year ended 2014. The tax equivalent net interest margin for the year ended 2015 declined by 42 basis points to 3.64%, from 4.06% for the year ended 2014.\nThe increase in interest income in 2015 is due to higher volumes of earning assets. The 2015 loan growth coupled with the ramp up of investment securities in advance of the branch acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2014 fueled the expansion in our earning asset base. The decline in net interest margin for the comparative full year period was due to the mix of average earning asset growth, which was more heavily weighted toward investment securities. A significant portion of the investments acquired in the latter half of 2014 were shorter in duration, and therefore have lower yields, to provide additional cash flow to support future loan portfolio growth. In addition, the Bank experienced lower yields on its loan portfolio due to the current historically low rate environment coupled, with strong competition for quality credit customers. While asset yields are below historical levels, efforts to increase overall earning assets have resulted in a higher level of net interest income. Further, the Bank continued to balance customers' desires to maintain liquidity in their deposit selection with the possibility of a rising rate environment. As customers have moved more funds into lower cost non-maturity and short-term CD's, funding costs have decreased on a year-over-year basis. Should the interest rate environment remain relatively unchanged, the current margin is expected to remain relatively stable, and perhaps experience some expansion over the near-term as the shift back to a more normalized earning asset mix. See Table 2 - Rate/Volume Analysis\u201d and Table 3 - Yield/Cost Analysis\u201d above for additional information on interest income, interest expense, net interest income, average balances and yield/cost ratios.\nProvision for Credit Losses. The Bank recorded $800,000 of provisions for credit losses in 2015, compared to $1.1 million for 2014. The reduction in year-to-date provisions for credit losses is primarily attributable to the improvement in asset quality, as previously discussed. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Lending Activities-Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d and Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNon-interest Income. Total non-interest income increased to $14.3 million for 2015, from $8.6 million for 2014. Deposit fees and service charges increased to $8.1 million for 2015, from $4.4 million earned in 2014. Deposit fees and service charges represented 56.5% of total non-interest income for 2015, compared to 51.1% for 2014. This increase primarily reflects additional revenue generated from accounts acquired in the branch acquisition transaction, as well as from the introduction of new products and product enhancements. We anticipate additional service charge revenue from deposits going forward, as we focus on growing our core deposit base through new customer acquisition, and cross-selling existing customers with additional services.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal non-interest income generated from the sale and servicing of mortgage loans and loan fees increased to $3.1 million in 2015, from $2.4 million for 2014. Due to volatility in interest rates, mortgage originations declined slightly in the second half of 2015. The level of mortgage originations is expected to improve, as the overall economic climate improves in the Bank's market area.\nThe Bank sold $34.6 million of loans held for sale in 2015, compared to $21.3 million sold in 2014. Loans serviced for others and mortgage servicing rights were $297.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015, compared to $306.8 million and $1.2 million at December 31, 2014.\nGains from sales of investment securities available for sale increased to $1.4 million for 2015, from $14,000 for 2014. As previously noted, during 2014 we implemented a strategy to pre-invest a large portion of the anticipated branch acquisition transaction proceeds into short and intermediate term investment securities until the funds could be converted to higher yielding assets. The Bank sold $46.2 million of investment securities available for sale in 2015, compared to $788,000 sold in 2014, primarily to fund our loan portfolio growth, to provide liquidity, to support the Bank's operating and financing activities, as well as to reduce exposure to certain municipalities.\nIn its continued efforts of disposing of nonperforming assets, the Bank recorded net gains on sales of other real estate owned properties of $40,000 for 2015, compared to $115,000 for 2014. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIncluded in other non-interest income is revenue from BOLI investments of $510,000 for 2015, compared to $531,000 for 2014.\nTotal core non-interest income, excluding net gains and losses from OREO and investment securities sales, increased to $12.8 million for 2015, from $8.5 million for 2014, primarily due to the increase in deposit fees and service charges.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Total non-interest expenses for 2015 increased to $36.4 million, compared to $28.5 million for 2014. The overall increase in non-interest expenses is attributable to the impact of building an infrastructure to operate and support a larger asset and deposit base resulting from the branch acquisition transaction in mid-December of 2014. In addition, the Bank incurred approximately $425,000 and $1.7 million of one-time, pre-tax expenses associated with completing the branch acquisition in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCompensation and benefits expense increased to $19.4 million for 2015, from $15.8 million reported in 2014. The increase in compensation and benefits expense for 2015 is primarily attributable to the addition of expense for the staff in the acquired branch offices, the addition of experienced bankers to generate earning asset growth, as well as administrative staff required to support a much larger banking institution. Compensation and benefits expense for 2014 included $241,000 of expenses associated with the acquisition of nine branch offices.\nPremises and equipment expense increased to $5.3 million for 2015, from $3.6 million reported in 2014. Premises expense for 2014 included $94,000 of acquisition related expenses. While the branch acquisition has resulted in a larger infrastructure cost than our historical levels, we continue to explore opportunities to gain efficiency and performance improvement from our branch network. Our continuing evaluation of current markets and facilities, as well as exploring new opportunities to expand our footprint, will impact future occupancy expenses.\nThe cost of FDIC insurance was $609,000 for 2015, compared to $566,000 reported in 2014. The change in volume of FDIC insurance is attributable to the growth in our balance sheet subsequent to the branch acquisition transaction.\nMarketing expense for 2015 increased to $820,000, from $667,000 reported in 2014. Advertising expense for 2014 included $205,000 of acquisition related expenses. The Bank invested in building its brand awareness throughout an expanded footprint in 2015 with additional marketing efforts, and anticipates that advertising expenses will continue at current levels.\nData processing costs for 2015 increased to $3.6 million, from $2.3 million for 2014. The addition of new customers through the branch acquisition transaction had a direct result in increasing data processing costs. With continued focus on new customer acquisition and investing in emerging technology to better serve an increased volume customers, data processing costs may continue to rise, but at a slower pace than experienced during 2015.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal amortization of intangible assets, including MSRs and identifiable intangible assets, increased to $515,000 for 2015, from $221,000 for 2014. Amortization of MSRs was $228,000 for 2015, compared to $213,000 for 2014. Amortization of the CDI was $287,000 for 2015, compared to $8,000 for the 2014, as the CDI was only on the books for a portion of December 2014. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTotal expenses attributable to ongoing maintenance, property taxes and insurance and valuation adjustments for OREO properties declined to $632,000 for 2015, from $650,000 for 2014. Expenses for ongoing maintenance, property taxes and insurance were $436,000 for 2015, compared to $445,000 for 2014. Total OREO valuation adjustments declined to $195,000 for 2015, from $204,000 for 2014. See Notes 1 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther non-interest expense was $5.5 million for 2015, compared to $4.6 million for 2014. The year-over-year change in other non-interest expense is primarily due to the acquired branch offices. Other expense for 2015 included $180,000 of one-time costs related to the branch acquisition transaction. For 2014, other expense included $780,000 of one-time acquisition expenses and $345,000 of FHLB advances prepayment penalties.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense increased to $1.8 million for 2015, from $1.3 million for 2014. Income taxes for 2015 included a one-time $80,000 expense adjustment due a write down of our deferred tax asset given the impending decline in the North Carolina statutory tax rate for 2016. The effective income tax rates were 28.2% for 2015, compared to 24.8% for 2014. Changes in the relative level of investments in BOLI and tax-exempt municipal bonds, combined with income tax benefits related to the one-time expenses, impacted the level of income tax expense for the respective reporting periods.\nDuring 2015, the Company determined that its income tax expense associated with prior periods had been understated by a net amount of $434,000. For the periods prior to 2014 the cumulative net income tax expense understatement was $651,000. During 2014, the Company overstated income tax expense by $217,000. As a result, deferred tax asset and income tax receivable accounts have been adjusted to reflect the correction of this error, with a corresponding $434,000 reduction recorded to retained earnings, effective as of December 31, 2014. These corrections are similarly reflected as an adjustment to income tax expense, net income and retained earnings in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2014. Management has concluded that the error was not material to prior period consolidated financial statements. See Notes 1 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Legislature enacted significant tax reform in 2013 for lowering the state's corporate income tax rates. The state corporate income tax rate for 2014 was reduced from 6.9% to 6.0%; was reduced to 5.0% for 2015; is scheduled to be reduced to 4.0% for 2016; and may be reduced to 3.0% for 2017 if certain revenue goals set by the Legislature are met. These changes in the state income tax rates is expected to favorably impact the Company's income tax expense and effective tax rates over the next several years.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices. The consolidated financial statements of the Company and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. They require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Bank's operations. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all the assets and liabilities of the Bank are monetary. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Bank's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services.\nAccounting Standards Codification\u2122. The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) has issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification\u2122 (the Codification\u201d) as the source of authoritative accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) recognized by the FASB to be applied to nongovernmental entities. All previous US GAAP standards issued by a standard setter are superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the Codification will be considered non-authoritative. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on recent accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting principles, the respective effective and adoption dates, and the expected impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Bank is a party to certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, in the normal course of business, to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral. First South Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company\") was formed to issue common stock, owning 100% of First South Bank (the \"Bank\") and operating through the Bank a commercial banking business; therefore, this discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operation relates primarily to the Bank. The Company's common stock is listed and trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol FSBK.\nThe business of the Bank consists principally of attracting deposits from the general public and using them to originate secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans, permanent mortgage and construction loans secured by single-family residences and other loans and leases. The Bank's earnings depend primarily on its net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The Bank's earnings are also impacted by the volume of non-interest income generated and non-interest expenses incurred.\nPrevailing economic conditions, competition, as well as federal and state regulations, affect the operations of the Bank. The Bank's cost of funds is influenced by interest rates offered on deposits by other financial institutions in the Bank's market area and by general market interest rates. Lending activities are affected by the demand for financing of real estate and various types of commercial, consumer and mortgage loans, and by the interest rates offered on such financing. The Bank's business emphasis is to operate as a well-capitalized, profitable and independent community oriented financial institution dedicated to providing quality customer service and meeting the financial needs of the communities it serves. The Bank believes it has been effective in serving its customers because of its ability to respond quickly and effectively to customer needs and inquiries.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources. Liquidity generally refers to the Bank's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its funding needs. Adequate liquidity guarantees sufficient funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals, fund loan commitments, maintain adequate reserve requirements, pay operating expenses, provide funds for debt service, and meet other general commitments. The Bank maintains its liquidity position under policy guidelines based on liquid assets in relationship to deposits and short-term borrowings. The Bank's primary sources of funds are customer deposits, loan principal and interest payments, proceeds from loan and securities sales, as well as access to wholesale funding sources such as advances from the FHLB of Atlanta and brokered certificates of deposit. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are influenced by interest rates, economic conditions and local competition. The Bank's primary investing activity is originating commercial, consumer and mortgage loans, lease financing receivables and purchases of investment securities. The Bank's primary financing activities are attracting checking, certificate, and savings deposits and obtaining FHLB advances.\nThe levels of cash and cash equivalents depend on the Bank's operating, investing and financing activities during any given period. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $46.2 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $38.0 million at December 31, 2015. The Bank has other sources of liquidity if an immediate need for additional funds arises. Investment securities available for sale, consisting of government agencies, mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities and corporate bonds totaled $192.6 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $248.3 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the Bank also had investment securities held to maturity of $510,000. See Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Bank's operating, investing and financing activities.\nBorrowings consisting of junior subordinated debentures were $10.3 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There were $17.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2016, compared to $37.0 million at December 31, 2015. During 2015, the Bank utilized FHLB borrowings as a source of funds to support loan portfolio growth. The Bank uses FHLB borrowings as a funding source to provide an effective means of managing its overall cost of funds and to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.\nThe Bank has pledged certain loans as collateral for actual or potential FHLB advances. The Bank has credit availability with the FHLB of 25% of the Bank's total assets. The Bank had $246.2 million of credit availability with the FHLB at December 31, 2016, compared to $228.2 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the Bank had lendable collateral value with the FHLB totaling $217.8 million, of which $17.0 million had been utilized to secure outstanding advances. Additional collateral would be required in order to access total borrowings up to the credit availability limit. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had pledged $139.7 million of loans as collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, which provided the Bank with $98.8 million of borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window. In addition, at December 31, 2016, the Company and Bank had available contingency funding sources of $5.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively, of pre-approved but unused lines of credit. See Notes 1 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n 42 \nJunior subordinated debentures totaling $10.3 million were outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. They were issued in 2003 through a private placement pooled trust preferred securities offering by First South Preferred Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust. The trust preferred securities bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 2.95% payable quarterly. In December 2014, the Company swapped the interest rate on these debentures to a fixed rate of 5.54% for the ensuing five year period. This strategy was executed to provide the Company with protection in a rising rate environment. During 2016, the Company restructured the terms of this swap to lower the fixed rate cost and extend its maturity. As a result, the restructured fixed rate effective June 30, 2016, is 4.97% and the maturity date of the swap is December 30, 2024. The debentures have a 30-year maturity and were first redeemable, in whole or in part, on or after September 30, 2008, with certain exceptions. For regulatory purposes, $10.0 million of the trust preferred securities qualifies as Tier 1 capital for the Company, and for the Bank, as the Company invested the proceeds in the Bank as additional paid-in capital. Proceeds from the trust preferred securities were used by the statutory trust to purchase junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAs a North Carolina chartered commercial bank and a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC\u201d) insured institution, the Bank is required to meet various federal and state regulatory capital standards. The Bank's total regulatory capital was $96.5 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $88.1 million at December 31, 2015.\nThe FDIC requires the Bank to meet the following minimum capital requirements: total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital and leverage capital. The required minimum capital ratios at December 31, 2016, adjusted for a Basel III 0.625% of risk-weighted assets phase in for capital conservation buffer, are as follows:\n 1. Total capital ratio of 8.625% of risk-weighted assets; \n 2. Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.625% of risk-weighted assets; \n 3. Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 5.125% of risk-weighted assets; and \n 4. Leverage ratio of 4% of average total assets. \nThe Bank is also subject to the capital requirements of North Carolina banking law, as described in Part I, Item 1. Business - Depository Institution Regulation - North Carolina Capital Requirements and Regulatory Action.\u201d The Bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements at December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Bank's actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nInterest Rate Risk and Asset/Liability Management. Interest rate risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates. The risk of loss can be reflected in diminished and/or reduced potential net interest income in future periods. Interest rate risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit taking activities. The Bank considers interest rate risk to be a significant risk, which could potentially have a material impact on earnings. The Bank measures its exposure to interest rate risk through net interest income simulation ( NII\u201d) and calculating our economic value of equity (\"EVE\"). NII measures the Bank's net interest income given various assumptions under various interest rate scenarios. EVE is derived by calculating the net present value of the cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items given a range of changes in market interest rates. The Bank's exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a quarterly basis by management and the ALCO. If the modeling results regarding net interest income and EVE are not within Board established targeted risk tolerance limits, the Board may direct management to adjust the Bank's asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within acceptable levels.\n 43 \nThe Bank strives to maintain a consistent net interest margin and reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates. Factors beyond the Bank's control, such as market interest rates and competition, may also impact interest income and interest expense. Given our level of fixed rate lending, coupled with embedded floors in our floating rate loan portfolio and our level of interest-bearing non-maturity deposits that can reprice immediately, the Bank has potential exposure to a near-term rising interest rate environment, which could result in a net interest margin compression for the Company. Management has taken steps to lessen this exposure by swapping some customer loans from fixed to floating rate, adding defensive investments in the investment portfolio and longer-term fixed rate funding to the balance sheet, including swapping the interest rate on its trust preferred debt to a fixed rate as described above.\nInterest rate risk and trends, liquidity and capital ratios are reported to the ALCO and the Board on a regular basis. The ALCO reviews the maturities of the Bank's assets and liabilities and establishes policies and strategies designed to regulate the flow of funds and to coordinate the sources, uses and pricing of such funds. The first priority in structuring and pricing assets and liabilities is to maintain an acceptable interest rate spread while reducing the net effects of changes in interest rates. The Bank's management is responsible for administering the policies and determinations of the ALCO and the Board with respect to the Bank's asset and liability goals and strategies.\nTable 1 below does not reflect downward rate interest rate projections. Given the current historically low level of interest rates, management and the ALCO are focused on the institution's exposure to a rising rate environment. The Board has adopted an interest rate risk management policy that establishes maximum decreases in EVE of 10%, 20%, 25% and 30%, and a maximum decrease in NII of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, in the event of an immediate 100 to 400 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates.\nTable 1 below presents a static simulation projection of changes in EVE and net interest income in the event of sudden increases in market interest rates for the various rate shock levels at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Bank's estimated changes in EVE and net interest income were within the Board established target limits. The Bank utilizes the services of a third party to assist with its interest rate risk modeling.\nTable 1 - Projected Change in EVE and Net Interest Income\n\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in Table 1. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities to repricing, they may react in differing degrees to changes in interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In addition, the proportion of adjustable-rate loans in the Bank's portfolio could decrease in future periods due to refinance activity if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table. Also, the ability of borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in interest rates.\nRate/Volume Analysis. A primary component of managing interest rate risk is based on changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Table 2 below summarizes the changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and their respective average balances during 2016 and 2015. Additionally, depending on market conditions existing at a given time, the Bank may sell fixed-rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. In managing its portfolio of available for sale investment securities, the Bank has the ability to sell securities should a need arise.\n 44 \nNet interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume on average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities. Table 2 below represents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Company's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. For each category of average interest-earning asset and average interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to: changes in volume; changes in rate; and total change.\n\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income. Net interest income primarily represents the difference between income derived from interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by both the difference between the yield on earning assets and the average cost of funds (\"interest rate spread\"), and the relative volume and mix of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities as well as noninterest-bearing deposits.\nTable 3 below contains comparative information relating to the Company's average balance sheet for 2016, 2015 and 2014, presented on a tax equivalent yield basis. Tax equivalent yields related to certain investment securities exempt from federal income tax are stated on a fully taxable basis, using a 34% federal tax rate and reduced by a disallowed portion of the tax exempt interest income. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The interest rate spread represents the difference between the tax equivalent yield on average earning assets and the average cost of funds. The tax equivalent net interest margin represents net interest income (tax adjusted basis) divided by average earning assets.\nNet interest income for the year ended 2016 totaled $32.6 million, a $3.2 million or 10.9% increase, from the $29.4 million generated during the comparative year ended 2015. The tax equivalent net interest margin for the year ended 2016 increased to 3.71%, from 3.64% for the prior year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe improvement in the tax-equivalent net interest margin is due to higher volumes of average earning assets and the change in the mix of our earning assets, as we have replaced lower yielding investments with higher yielding loans. On the liability side of the balance sheet, while we continue to seek expansion of our non-maturity deposit base, we have also taken steps to protect the Company from a rising rate environment by utilizing some longer-term funding. We anticipate the level of our current margin remaining somewhat stable over the near-term, unless there are dramatic movements in interest rates.\n 45 \n\n1. Shown as a tax-adjusted yield.\n2. Represents the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average cost of funds.\n3. Represents net interest income divided by average earning assets.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTotal assets increased to $990.7 million at December 31, 2016, from $946.3 million at December 31, 2015. Earning assets increased to $922.2 million at December 31, 2016, from $878.3 million at December 31, 2015. The ratio of earning assets to total assets was 93.1% at December 31, 2016, compared to 92.8% at December 31, 2015. The increase is attributable to a net increase in the volume of earning assets, resulting primarily from net growth in loans and leases held for investment. This growth was primarily funded by a $59.3 million increase in total deposits coupled with cash flow from the investment securities portfolio.\nInterest-bearing deposits with banks increased to $23.3 million at December 31, 2016, from $18.6 million at December 31, 2015. Overnight deposits are impacted by fluctuations in deposit levels and are available to fund securities purchases, loan originations, deposit withdrawals, liquidity management activities and daily operations of the Bank.\nThe investment securities portfolio totaled $193.1 million at December 31, 2016, versus $248.8 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, there were $9.3 million of purchases, $40.6 million of sales, $21.2 million of principal repayments, a $2.1 million decline in unrealized holding gains, $467,000 of net realized gains and $1.5 million of net accretion of premiums and discounts. The net result of cash flows from scheduled amortization and maturities, as well as the sales of securities, were used primarily to fund growth in loans and leases held for investment. The Bank may make changes in the securities portfolio mix to manage sensitivity to future interest rate changes. See Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTotal loans held for sale increased to $5.1 million at December 31, 2016, from $3.9 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting the net effect of current mortgage lending activity. During 2016, there were $44.3 million of mortgage loan sales, $44.0 million of originations net of principal payments and $1.4 million of net realized gains. See Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n 46 \nTotal loans and leases held for investment grew by $93.6 million during 2016. As a result of this net growth, total loans and leases held for investment increased to $700.6 million at December 31, 2016, from $607.0 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, there were $94.6 million of originations net of principal payments, $345,000 of charge-offs and $648,000 of transfers to OREO. As a result of the Bank's total loan and total deposit growth during 2016, the loans-to-deposits ratio increased to 81.1% at December 31, 2016, from 75.3% at December 31, 2015.\nThe Bank originates both fixed and adjustable rate secured and unsecured loans held for investment. Adjustable rate loans provide the ability to better manage exposure to market and interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates. The Bank continues to limit the origination of new acquisition and development loans, land loans or speculative lot loans. After successfully reducing its acquisition, development and construction concentration, the Bank has resumed originations, in select markets within its footprint, of speculative and pre-sold construction loans on 1-to-4 family residential properties and construction loans for commercial projects with an emphasis on owner-occupied and preleased non-owner occupied properties.\nAsset quality is a key component of the Bank's short and long-term performance objectives. Loans and leases held for investment on nonaccrual status, including TDRs on nonaccrual status totaled $3.1 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $3.2 million at December 31, 2015. Management and the Board are committed to having strong asset quality, as we believe this is a key driver of stock price performance and overall shareholder value. The ratio of loans and leases on nonaccrual status to total loans and leases improved to 0.44% at December 31, 2016, from 0.53% at December 31, 2015.\nLoans are generally placed on nonaccrual status, and accrued but unpaid interest is reversed, when in management's judgment, it is determined that the collectability of interest, but not necessarily principal, is doubtful. Generally, this occurs when payment is delinquent in excess of 90 days. Consumer loans that have become more than 180 days past due are generally charged off or a specific allowance may be provided for any expected loss. All other loans are charged off when management concludes that they are uncollectible.\nManagement has thoroughly evaluated all nonperforming loans and believes they are either well collateralized or adequately reserved. However, there can be no assurance in the future that regulators, increased volume and risks in the loan portfolio, adverse changes in economic conditions or other factors will not require additional adjustments to the ALLL for these assets. Aside from the loans identified on nonaccrual status, there were no loans at December 31, 2016, where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with their current loan repayment terms. See Notes 1, 4 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe ALLL was $8.7 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $7.9 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting provisions for credit losses and net charge-offs. During 2016, there were $970,000 of provisions for credit losses and $163,000 of net charge-offs. The ratio of the ALLL to loans and leases held for investment was 1.24% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.30% at December 31, 2015. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Lending Activities-Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d and Notes 1 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOREO acquired from foreclosures was reduced to $3.2 million at December 31, 2016, from $6.1 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, there were $3.4 million of disposals, $131,000 of net realized gains, $251,000 of valuation adjustments, net of $648,000 of additions. OREO consists of residential and commercial properties, developed lots and raw land. The Bank believes the adjusted carrying value of these properties is representative of their fair market value, although there are no assurances that ultimate sales will be equal to or greater than the carrying value. See Notes 1, 7 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Bank's investment in bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) increased to $18.1 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $15.6 million at December 31, 2015. The investment returns from BOLI are utilized to offset a portion of the cost of providing benefit plans to certain employees.\nGoodwill was $4.2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is tested for impairment annually. The Company's most recent annual impairment test determined there was no goodwill impairment. Identifiable intangible assets were $1.6 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $1.9 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting the core deposit intangible ( CDI\u201d) associated with a prior period branch acquisition transaction, which is being amortized over a ten year period. See Notes 1 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n 47 \nMSRs increased to $2.1 million at December 31, 2016, from $1.3 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, the Bank purchased the MSRs of 452 high-quality Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans with an unpaid principal balance of $84.6 million. The selection of these mortgage loans to service was based on their quality as well as their geographic location. All of the loans acquired were current as to payment on the purchase date and the Bank had the ability to push-back any loans that prepaid or became delinquent within 90 days. In addition, all of these loans are located in the state of North Carolina and a significant portion of the borrowers reside within the Bank's footprint. Mortgage loans serviced for others increased to $372.0 million at December 31, 2016, from $297.5 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to these acquired loans.\nPrepaid expenses and other assets were $8.4 million at December 31, 2016, versus $8.3 million at December 31, 2015, primarily reflecting changes and adjustments in our deferred tax asset. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Non-Interest Expense below for additional information.\nTotal deposits increased by $59.3 million to $870.6 million at December 31, 2016, from $811.3 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, non-maturity deposits including noninterest bearing accounts, savings accounts and interest bearing demand accounts grew by $27.4 million, $9.7 million and $25.7 million, respectively, and were partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in certificates of deposit. Certificates of deposit represented 29.5% of total deposits at December 31, 2016, compared to 32.1% at December 31, 2015. Noninterest bearing accounts increased to 22.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2016, from 20.9% at December 31, 2015. The Bank strives to manage its cost of deposits through a combination of monitoring the volume and pricing of new and maturing CDs and growth in non-maturity deposits, in relationship to current funding needs and market interest rates. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Interest Expense below for additional information.\nFHLB borrowings declined by $20.0 million to $17.0 million at December 31, 2016, from $37.0 million at December 31, 2015. The Bank uses FHLB borrowings as a funding source to provide an effective means of managing its overall cost of funds and to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. There was $10.3 million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Part I - Item 1. Business-Deposit Activity and Other Sources of Funds-Borrowings\u201d above, and Notes 13 and 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nStockholders' equity increased by $5.0 million to $87.2 million at December 31, 2016, from $82.2 million at December 31, 2015. This increase reflects the $7.0 million of net income earned for the year ended December 31, 2016, net of a $938,000 decline in accumulated other comprehensive income and $1.1 million of cash dividends declared. Accumulated other comprehensive income totaled $1.4 million at December 31, 2016, versus $2.4 million at December 31, 2015. See Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Notes 1 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe growth in equity coupled with a reduction in the Bank's CDI resulted in an increase in tangible equity. As such, the tangible book value per common share increased to $8.576 at December 31, 2016, from $8.02 at December 31, 2015, and the tangible equity to assets ratio increased to 8.21% at December 31, 2016, from 8.04% at December 31, 2015.\nThere were 9,494,935 common shares outstanding at December 31, 2016, compared to 9,489,222 shares outstanding at December 31, 2015, reflecting the effect of 3,475 shares issued pursuant to the vesting of restricted stock awards and 2,238 shares issued pursuant to stock options exercised during 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividend payments. The continued payment of cash dividends reflects the strong capital position of the Company, sound and improved financial performance and our desire to provide additional value to our stockholders. The Board will continue to review the status of future dividend payments, which will depend upon the Company's financial condition, earnings, equity structure, capital needs and economic conditions.\n 48 \nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by its federal and state banking regulators. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank's regulatory capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements and the Bank's regulatory capital position was categorized as well capitalized\u201d. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2016, that management believes have changed the Bank's well capitalized\u201d category. See Part I, Item 1. Business - Depository Institution Regulation - Capital Requirements\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d above and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nGeneral. The Company reported a 48.6% increase in net income to $7.0 million for 2016, from $4.7 million for 2015. Net income per diluted common share increased to $0.73 per share for 2016, from $0.49 per share for 2015. The improvement in earnings for 2016 was positively impacted by increases in net interest income and non-interest income, as well as a lower volume of non-interest expense, while being partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses associated with the strong loan portfolio growth. In addition, during the first quarter of 2015, the Bank incurred $425,000 of one-time pre-tax transaction expenses associated with acquiring nine branch offices in mid-December of 2014.\nKey Performance Ratios. Key performance ratios are return on average assets ( ROA\u201d), return on average equity ( ROE\u201d) and efficiency. For 2016, ROA and ROE improved to 0.72% and 8.02%, respectively, from 0.52% and 5.72%, respectively, for 2015. The efficiency ratio (non-interest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus non-interest income) also improved to 76.51% for 2016, from 84.53% for 2015. The efficiency ratio measures the proportion of net operating revenues that are absorbed by overhead expenses. The efficiency ratio was elevated for 2015 due primarily to franchise expansion. We anticipate the efficiency ratio to improve over time as the investments we have made in staffing and infrastructure are able to generate a larger earning asset base and an increased level of earnings.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased to $36.2 million for 2016, from $32.5 million for 2015. The year-over-year growth in interest income is due primarily to changes in the composition and volume of our earning asset base, coupled with an increase in yields on earning assets, as we have replaced lower yielding investments with higher yielding loans. Average earning assets increased during 2016 to $889.6 million, from $822.6 million for 2015, primarily reflecting the strong growth in the level of our loans and leases held for investment during the current year. We have also experienced an increase in yields on earning assets over comparative periods. The tax equivalent yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 4.11% for 2016, from 4.01% for 2015.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $3.6 million for 2016, from $3.1 million for 2015. This change in interest expense was primarily the result of an increased volume of average interest bearing liabilities that were utilized to support earnings asset growth. Interest expense was also impacted by a five basis point increase in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased to $691.6 million for 2016, from $653.1 million for 2015. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased to $177.0 million for 2016, from $158.0 million for 2015. These combined increases reflect the impact of prior period branch acquisitions, as well as organic growth during 2016. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.52% for 2016, from 0.47% for the comparative 2015 annual period. The Bank has strived to manage its funding cost through a combination of growing noninterest bearing demand deposits and lower costing non-maturity deposits. In addition, the Bank has restructured its FHLB advances in order to extend some maturities to provide protection in a rising rate environment and a reduced the interest rate paid on junior subordinated notes. These savings were partially offset by additional cost on the longer-term portion of our CD portfolio.\nEffective December 30, 2014, the Company swapped the interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures from three-month LIBOR plus 2.95%, to a fixed rate of 5.54% for the ensuing five year period. This strategy was executed to provide the Company with protection in the event of a rising rate environment. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company restructured the terms of this swap to lower the fixed rate cost and extend its maturity. As a result, the restructured fixed rate effective as of June 30, 2016, is 4.97% and the maturity date of the swap is December 30, 2024.\n 49 \nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended 2016 increased to $32.6 million, a $3.2 million or 10.9% increase, versus the $29.4 million generated during the year ended 2015. The tax equivalent net interest margin for the year ended 2016 increased to 3.71%, from 3.64% for the year ended 2015.\nThe improvement in the tax-equivalent net interest margin is due to higher volumes of average earning assets and the change in the mix of our earning assets, as we have replaced lower yielding investments with higher yielding loans. On the liability side of the balance sheet, while we continue to seek expansion of our non-maturity deposit base, we have also taken steps to protect the Company from a rising rate environment by adding some longer-term funding. We continue to balance our customers' desires to maintain liquidity in their deposit selection with the possibility of a rising rate environment. During 2016, customers have moved more funds into lower cost non-maturity and short-term CD's. We anticipate the level of our current margin remaining somewhat stable over the near-term, unless there are dramatic movements in interest rates. See Table 2 - Rate/Volume Analysis\u201d and Table 3 - Yield/Cost Analysis\u201d above for additional information on interest income, interest expense, net interest income, average balances and yield/cost ratios.\nProvision for Credit Losses. The Bank recorded $970,000 of provisions for credit losses in 2016, compared to $800,000 for 2015. The Bank's methodology for determining its provision for credit losses includes amounts specifically allocated to credits that are individually determined to be impaired, as well as general provisions allocated to groups of loans that have not been individually assessed for impairment. The increase in provision for credit losses is primarily attributable to support the net growth in loans and leases held for investment during 2016, as previously discussed. Provisions for credit losses are necessary to maintain the ALLL at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb probable future losses in the loan portfolio. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Lending Activities-Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d and Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNon-Interest Income. Total non-interest income was $14.2 million for 2016, compared to $14.3 million for 2015. Non-interest income consists of deposit fees and service charges; loan fees and charges; mortgage loan servicing fees; gain on sale and other fees on mortgage loans, gain on sales of investment securities and OREO; and other miscellaneous income. The Bank strives to maintain consistency of its non-interest income earned across both deposit and loan service offerings. Fees and service charges on deposits, and fees on loans and loan servicing fees earned during each period are influenced by the volume of deposits and loans outstanding, the volume of the various types of deposit and loan account transactions processed, the volume of loans serviced for others and the collection of related fees and service charges.\nDeposit fees and service charges, the largest component of non-interest income, totaled $7.6 million for 2016, versus $8.1 million earned in 2015. Deposit fees and service charges represented 53.5% of total non-interest income for 2016, compared to 56.5% for 2015. The amount of service charges and fees is generally dependent upon the volume of account transaction activity and the collection of related service charges and fees. Deposit fees and service charges have been enhanced from historical levels as accounts acquired in the 2014 branch acquisition transaction, as well as from the introduction of new products and product enhancements. We anticipate stable service charge revenue from deposits going forward as we focus on growing our core deposit base through new quality customer relationships.\nThe Bank's mortgage division generates revenues through originations, sales and servicing of mortgage loans. Total non-interest income generated from the sale and servicing of mortgage loans and loan fees increased to $3.6 million in 2013, from $3.1 million for 2015. We anticipate the level of mortgage originations to remain consistent, with the overall economic climate improving in the Bank's market area. The Bank sells the majority of its originated mortgage loans and retains the servicing rights. The Bank may sell or securitize fixed-rate residential mortgage loans to reduce interest rate and credit risk exposure, and to provide a more balanced sensitivity to future interest rate changes, while retaining certain other held for sale mortgage loans for possible future securitization into available for sale mortgage-backed securities.\nThe Bank sold $44.3 million of mortgage loans held for sale in 2016, compared to $34.6 million sold in 2015. Loans serviced for others and MSRs were $372.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016, compared to $297.5 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2015. We will continue to explore various strategies to enhance our non-interest income, including the purchase of MSRs, as previously discussed. The future levels of gains on sales of mortgage loans and loan servicing fees are dependent on the pricing and volume of new mortgage loan originations.\n 50 \nGains from sales of investment securities available for sale were $467,000 for 2016, versus $1.4 million for 2015. As previously noted, in 2014 we implemented a strategy to pre-invest a large portion of the anticipated branch acquisition transaction proceeds into short and intermediate term investment securities, until the funds could be converted to higher yielding assets. The Bank sold $40.6 million of investment securities available for sale in 2016, compared to $46.2 million sold in 2015, primarily to fund our loan portfolio growth.\nIn its continued efforts of disposing of nonperforming assets, the Bank recorded net gains on sales of OREO properties of $131,000 for 2016, compared to $40,000 for 2015. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIncluded in other non-interest income is revenue from BOLI investments of $562,000 for 2016, compared to $510,000 for 2015. The Bank utilizes the investment returns from the BOLI to recover a portion of the cost of providing employee benefit plans.\nOther non-interest income for 2016 includes an increase in SBA related revenue to $520,000 for 2016, from $55,000 for 2015. While the Bank has originated SBA loans in prior years, we only began the process of actively selling and servicing these credits during the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, other income for 2016 includes a $230,000 non-recurring payment to the Bank.\nTotal core non-interest income, excluding net gains and losses from OREO and investment securities sales, increased to $13.6 million for 2016, from $12.8 million for 2015.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Total non-interest expenses for 2016 declined by $473,000 to $35.9 million, from $36.4 million for 2015.\nCompensation and benefits expense, the largest component of non-interest expenses, increased to $19.8 million for 2016, from $19.4 million reported in 2015. During 2016, the Bank consolidated three existing branches into nearby locations, and incurred $65,000 of severance costs associated with these branch consolidations. The Bank will continue to manage staffing levels to ensure we meet the ongoing needs of our customers and to support our future growth.\nPremises and equipment expense increased to $5.5 million for 2016, from $5.3 million reported in 2015. Premises and equipment expense for 2016 includes the retirement of certain leasehold improvements and other fixed assets at the branch locations that were consolidated and closed. We will continue to explore opportunities to gain efficiency and performance improvement from our branch network.\nThe cost of FDIC insurance increased to $632,000 for 2016, from to $609,000 reported in 2015. The increase in FDIC insurance premiums during 2016 was due to the growth in our balance sheet.\nMarketing expense for 2016 declined to $702,000, from $820,000 reported in 2015. The Bank continues to invest in building our brand awareness throughout our expanded footprint with its marketing efforts. We anticipate that marketing expenses will remain at or below current levels as we look to take a more product targeted approach.\nData processing costs for 2016 declined to $3.1 million, from $3.6 million for 2015, as the Bank has renegotiated its contract with its third party processing provider. Data processing expense for 2015 included $173,000 of one-time branch acquisition expenses. Data processing costs fluctuate in conjunction with changes in the number of customer accounts and transaction activity volumes. As we continue to focus on new customer acquisition and to invest in emerging technology to better serve our customer base, we anticipate that data processing costs may increase in support of future growth.\nTotal amortization of intangible assets, including MSRs and identifiable intangible assets, increased to $571,000 for 2016, from $515,000 for 2015. Amortization of MSRs was $287,000 for 2016, compared to $228,000 for 2015, as the Bank purchased additional MSRs mid-way through the current year. Amortization of the Company's CDI, which is the only identifiable intangible asset subject to amortization, was $284,000 for 2016, compared to $287,000 for the 2015. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n 51 \nTotal expenses attributable to ongoing maintenance, property taxes and insurance and valuation adjustments for OREO properties was reduced to $553,000 for 2016, from $632,000 for 2015. OREO valuation adjustments included therein were $250,000 for 2016, compared to $195,000 for 2015. See Notes 1 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Management continuously analyzes the carrying value of OREO and makes valuation adjustments as necessary.\nOther non-interest expense declined to $5.1 million for 2016, compared to $5.5 million for 2015. As previously discussed, during 2016 the Bank consolidated three existing branches into nearby locations. Two of these locations were leased and the third was owned. During 2016, the Bank entered into a contract to sell the owned location and realized an $85,000 pre-tax loss as a result. Other expense for 2015 included $180,000 of one-time branch acquisition expenses.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense increased to $3.0 million for 2016, from $1.8 million for 2015. Changes in the amount of income tax expense reflect changes in pretax income, deductible expenses, the application of permanent and temporary differences and the applicable income tax rates in effect during each period. Income taxes for 2016 and 2015 includes a $74,000 and $80,000 expense adjustment, respectively, due a write down of our deferred tax asset, as a result of a reduction in the North Carolina statutory tax rates for each respective year. The effective income tax rates were 29.8% for 2016, compared to 28.2% for 2015. The Bank's investment in BOLI and tax-exempt municipal bonds contribute to more favorable effective income tax rates, which has been partially offset by the strong growth in the loan portfolio.\nThe North Carolina State Legislature (the Legislature\u201d) enacted significant tax reform in 2013 for lowering the state's corporate income tax rates. The state corporate income tax rate for 2014 was reduced from 6.9% to 6.0%; was reduced to 5.0% for 2015; was reduced to 4.0% for 2016; and", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral. First South Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company\") was formed to issue common stock, owning 100% of First South Bank (the \"Bank\") and operating through the Bank a commercial banking business; therefore, this discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operation relates primarily to the Bank. The Company's common stock is listed and trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol FSBK.\nThe business of the Bank consists principally of attracting deposits from the general public and using them to originate secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans, permanent mortgage and construction loans secured by single-family residences and other loans and leases. The Bank's earnings depend primarily on its net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The Bank's earnings are also impacted by the volume of non-interest income generated and non-interest expenses incurred.\nPrevailing economic conditions, competition, as well as federal and state regulations, affect the operations of the Bank. The Bank's cost of funds is influenced by interest rates offered on deposits by other financial institutions in the Bank's market area and by general market interest rates. Lending activities are affected by the demand for financing of real estate and various types of commercial, consumer and mortgage loans, and by the interest rates offered on such financing. The Bank's business emphasis is to operate as a well-capitalized, profitable and independent community oriented financial institution dedicated to providing quality customer service and meeting the financial needs of the communities it serves. The Bank believes it has been effective in serving its customers because of its ability to respond quickly and effectively to customer needs and inquiries.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources. Liquidity generally refers to the Bank's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its funding needs. Adequate liquidity guarantees sufficient funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals, fund loan commitments, maintain adequate reserve requirements, pay operating expenses, provide funds for debt service, and meet other general commitments. The Bank maintains its liquidity position under policy guidelines based on liquid assets in relationship to deposits and short-term borrowings. The Bank's primary sources of funds are customer deposits, loan principal and interest payments, proceeds from loan and securities sales, as well as access to wholesale funding sources such as advances from the FHLB of Atlanta and brokered certificates of deposit. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are influenced by interest rates, economic conditions and local competition. The Bank's primary investing activity is originating commercial, consumer and mortgage loans, lease financing receivables and purchases of investment securities. The Bank's primary financing activities are attracting checking, certificate, and savings deposits and obtaining FHLB advances.\nThe levels of cash and cash equivalents depend on the Bank's operating, investing and financing activities during any given period. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $46.2 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $38.0 million at December 31, 2015. The Bank has other sources of liquidity if an immediate need for additional funds arises. Investment securities available for sale, consisting of government agencies, mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities and corporate bonds totaled $192.6 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $248.3 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the Bank also had investment securities held to maturity of $510,000. See Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Bank's operating, investing and financing activities.\nBorrowings consisting of junior subordinated debentures were $10.3 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There were $17.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2016, compared to $37.0 million at December 31, 2015. During 2015, the Bank utilized FHLB borrowings as a source of funds to support loan portfolio growth. The Bank uses FHLB borrowings as a funding source to provide an effective means of managing its overall cost of funds and to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.\nThe Bank has pledged certain loans as collateral for actual or potential FHLB advances. The Bank has credit availability with the FHLB of 25% of the Bank's total assets. The Bank had $246.2 million of credit availability with the FHLB at December 31, 2016, compared to $228.2 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the Bank had lendable collateral value with the FHLB totaling $217.8 million, of which $17.0 million had been utilized to secure outstanding advances. Additional collateral would be required in order to access total borrowings up to the credit availability limit. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had pledged $139.7 million of loans as collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, which provided the Bank with $98.8 million of borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window. In addition, at December 31, 2016, the Company and Bank had available contingency funding sources of $5.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively, of pre-approved but unused lines of credit. See Notes 1 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n 42 \nJunior subordinated debentures totaling $10.3 million were outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. They were issued in 2003 through a private placement pooled trust preferred securities offering by First South Preferred Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust. The trust preferred securities bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 2.95% payable quarterly. In December 2014, the Company swapped the interest rate on these debentures to a fixed rate of 5.54% for the ensuing five year period. This strategy was executed to provide the Company with protection in a rising rate environment. During 2016, the Company restructured the terms of this swap to lower the fixed rate cost and extend its maturity. As a result, the restructured fixed rate effective June 30, 2016, is 4.97% and the maturity date of the swap is December 30, 2024. The debentures have a 30-year maturity and were first redeemable, in whole or in part, on or after September 30, 2008, with certain exceptions. For regulatory purposes, $10.0 million of the trust preferred securities qualifies as Tier 1 capital for the Company, and for the Bank, as the Company invested the proceeds in the Bank as additional paid-in capital. Proceeds from the trust preferred securities were used by the statutory trust to purchase junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAs a North Carolina chartered commercial bank and a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC\u201d) insured institution, the Bank is required to meet various federal and state regulatory capital standards. The Bank's total regulatory capital was $96.5 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $88.1 million at December 31, 2015.\nThe FDIC requires the Bank to meet the following minimum capital requirements: total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital and leverage capital. The required minimum capital ratios at December 31, 2016, adjusted for a Basel III 0.625% of risk-weighted assets phase in for capital conservation buffer, are as follows:\n 1. Total capital ratio of 8.625% of risk-weighted assets; \n 2. Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.625% of risk-weighted assets; \n 3. Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 5.125% of risk-weighted assets; and \n 4. Leverage ratio of 4% of average total assets. \nThe Bank is also subject to the capital requirements of North Carolina banking law, as described in Part I, Item 1. Business - Depository Institution Regulation - North Carolina Capital Requirements and Regulatory Action.\u201d The Bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements at December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Bank's actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nInterest Rate Risk and Asset/Liability Management. Interest rate risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates. The risk of loss can be reflected in diminished and/or reduced potential net interest income in future periods. Interest rate risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit taking activities. The Bank considers interest rate risk to be a significant risk, which could potentially have a material impact on earnings. The Bank measures its exposure to interest rate risk through net interest income simulation ( NII\u201d) and calculating our economic value of equity (\"EVE\"). NII measures the Bank's net interest income given various assumptions under various interest rate scenarios. EVE is derived by calculating the net present value of the cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items given a range of changes in market interest rates. The Bank's exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a quarterly basis by management and the ALCO. If the modeling results regarding net interest income and EVE are not within Board established targeted risk tolerance limits, the Board may direct management to adjust the Bank's asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within acceptable levels.\n 43 \nThe Bank strives to maintain a consistent net interest margin and reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates. Factors beyond the Bank's control, such as market interest rates and competition, may also impact interest income and interest expense. Given our level of fixed rate lending, coupled with embedded floors in our floating rate loan portfolio and our level of interest-bearing non-maturity deposits that can reprice immediately, the Bank has potential exposure to a near-term rising interest rate environment, which could result in a net interest margin compression for the Company. Management has taken steps to lessen this exposure by swapping some customer loans from fixed to floating rate, adding defensive investments in the investment portfolio and longer-term fixed rate funding to the balance sheet, including swapping the interest rate on its trust preferred debt to a fixed rate as described above.\nInterest rate risk and trends, liquidity and capital ratios are reported to the ALCO and the Board on a regular basis. The ALCO reviews the maturities of the Bank's assets and liabilities and establishes policies and strategies designed to regulate the flow of funds and to coordinate the sources, uses and pricing of such funds. The first priority in structuring and pricing assets and liabilities is to maintain an acceptable interest rate spread while reducing the net effects of changes in interest rates. The Bank's management is responsible for administering the policies and determinations of the ALCO and the Board with respect to the Bank's asset and liability goals and strategies.\nTable 1 below does not reflect downward rate interest rate projections. Given the current historically low level of interest rates, management and the ALCO are focused on the institution's exposure to a rising rate environment. The Board has adopted an interest rate risk management policy that establishes maximum decreases in EVE of 10%, 20%, 25% and 30%, and a maximum decrease in NII of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, in the event of an immediate 100 to 400 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates.\nTable 1 below presents a static simulation projection of changes in EVE and net interest income in the event of sudden increases in market interest rates for the various rate shock levels at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Bank's estimated changes in EVE and net interest income were within the Board established target limits. The Bank utilizes the services of a third party to assist with its interest rate risk modeling.\nTable 1 - Projected Change in EVE and Net Interest Income\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Economic Value of Portfolio Equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Interest Income </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in Rates </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+ 400 bp </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,622 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+ 300 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+ 200 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169,388 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+ 100 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Base </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in Table 1. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities to repricing, they may react in differing degrees to changes in interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In addition, the proportion of adjustable-rate loans in the Bank's portfolio could decrease in future periods due to refinance activity if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table. Also, the ability of borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in interest rates.\nRate/Volume Analysis. A primary component of managing interest rate risk is based on changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Table 2 below summarizes the changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and their respective average balances during 2016 and 2015. Additionally, depending on market conditions existing at a given time, the Bank may sell fixed-rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. In managing its portfolio of available for sale investment securities, the Bank has the ability to sell securities should a need arise.\n 44 \nNet interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume on average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities. Table 2 below represents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Company's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated.

Net interest income primarily represents the difference between income derived from interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by both the difference between the yield on earning assets and the average cost of funds (\"interest rate spread\"), and the relative volume and mix of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities as well as noninterest-bearing deposits.\nTable 3 below contains comparative information relating to the Company's average balance sheet for 2016, 2015 and 2014, presented on a tax equivalent yield basis. Tax equivalent yields related to certain investment securities exempt from federal income tax are stated on a fully taxable basis, using a 34% federal tax rate and reduced by a disallowed portion of the tax exempt interest income. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The interest rate spread represents the difference between the tax equivalent yield on average earning assets and the average cost of funds. The tax equivalent net interest margin represents net interest income (tax adjusted basis) divided by average earning assets.\nNet interest income for the year ended 2016 totaled $32.6 million, a $3.2 million or 10.9% increase, from the $29.4 million generated during the comparative year ended 2015. The tax equivalent net interest margin for the year ended 2016 increased to 3.71%, from 3.64% for the prior year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe improvement in the tax-equivalent net interest margin is due to higher volumes of average earning assets and the change in the mix of our earning assets, as we have replaced lower yielding investments with higher yielding loans. On the liability side of the balance sheet, while we continue to seek expansion of our non-maturity deposit base, we have also taken steps to protect the Company from a rising rate environment by utilizing some longer-term funding. We anticipate the level of our current margin remaining somewhat stable over the near-term, unless there are dramatic movements in interest rates.\n 45 \nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>Table 3 -

Represents net interest income divided by average earning assets.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTotal assets increased to $990.7 million at December 31, 2016, from $946.3 million at December 31, 2015. Earning assets increased to $922.2 million at December 31, 2016, from $878.3 million at December 31, 2015. The ratio of earning assets to total assets was 93.1% at December 31, 2016, compared to 92.8% at December 31, 2015. The increase is attributable to a net increase in the volume of earning assets, resulting primarily from net growth in loans and leases held for investment. This growth was primarily funded by a $59.3 million increase in total deposits coupled with cash flow from the investment securities portfolio.\nInterest-bearing deposits with banks increased to $23.3 million at December 31, 2016, from $18.6 million at December 31, 2015. Overnight deposits are impacted by fluctuations in deposit levels and are available to fund securities purchases, loan originations, deposit withdrawals, liquidity management activities and daily operations of the Bank.\nThe investment securities portfolio totaled $193.1 million at December 31, 2016, versus $248.8 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, there were $9.3 million of purchases, $40.6 million of sales, $21.2 million of principal repayments, a $2.1 million decline in unrealized holding gains, $467,000 of net realized gains and $1.5 million of net accretion of premiums and discounts. The net result of cash flows from scheduled amortization and maturities, as well as the sales of securities, were used primarily to fund growth in loans and leases held for investment. The Bank may make changes in the securities portfolio mix to manage sensitivity to future interest rate changes. See Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTotal loans held for sale increased to $5.1 million at December 31, 2016, from $3.9 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting the net effect of current mortgage lending activity. During 2016, there were $44.3 million of mortgage loan sales, $44.0 million of originations net of principal payments and $1.4 million of net realized gains. See Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n 46 \nTotal loans and leases held for investment grew by $93.6 million during 2016. As a result of this net growth, total loans and leases held for investment increased to $700.6 million at December 31, 2016, from $607.0 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, there were $94.6 million of originations net of principal payments, $345,000 of charge-offs and $648,000 of transfers to OREO. As a result of the Bank's total loan and total deposit growth during 2016, the loans-to-deposits ratio increased to 81.1% at December 31, 2016, from 75.3% at December 31, 2015.\nThe Bank originates both fixed and adjustable rate secured and unsecured loans held for investment. Adjustable rate loans provide the ability to better manage exposure to market and interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates. The Bank continues to limit the origination of new acquisition and development loans, land loans or speculative lot loans. After successfully reducing its acquisition, development and construction concentration, the Bank has resumed originations, in select markets within its footprint, of speculative and pre-sold construction loans on 1-to-4 family residential properties and construction loans for commercial projects with an emphasis on owner-occupied and preleased non-owner occupied properties.\nAsset quality is a key component of the Bank's short and long-term performance objectives. Loans and leases held for investment on nonaccrual status, including TDRs on nonaccrual status totaled $3.1 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $3.2 million at December 31, 2015. Management and the Board are committed to having strong asset quality, as we believe this is a key driver of stock price performance and overall shareholder value. The ratio of loans and leases on nonaccrual status to total loans and leases improved to 0.44% at December 31, 2016, from 0.53% at December 31, 2015.\nLoans are generally placed on nonaccrual status, and accrued but unpaid interest is reversed, when in management's judgment, it is determined that the collectability of interest, but not necessarily principal, is doubtful. Generally, this occurs when payment is delinquent in excess of 90 days. Consumer loans that have become more than 180 days past due are generally charged off or a specific allowance may be provided for any expected loss. All other loans are charged off when management concludes that they are uncollectible.\nManagement has thoroughly evaluated all nonperforming loans and believes they are either well collateralized or adequately reserved. However, there can be no assurance in the future that regulators, increased volume and risks in the loan portfolio, adverse changes in economic conditions or other factors will not require additional adjustments to the ALLL for these assets. Aside from the loans identified on nonaccrual status, there were no loans at December 31, 2016, where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with their current loan repayment terms. See Notes 1, 4 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe ALLL was $8.7 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $7.9 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting provisions for credit losses and net charge-offs. During 2016, there were $970,000 of provisions for credit losses and $163,000 of net charge-offs. The ratio of the ALLL to loans and leases held for investment was 1.24% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.30% at December 31, 2015. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Lending Activities-Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d and Notes 1 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOREO acquired from foreclosures was reduced to $3.2 million at December 31, 2016, from $6.1 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, there were $3.4 million of disposals, $131,000 of net realized gains, $251,000 of valuation adjustments, net of $648,000 of additions. OREO consists of residential and commercial properties, developed lots and raw land. The Bank believes the adjusted carrying value of these properties is representative of their fair market value, although there are no assurances that ultimate sales will be equal to or greater than the carrying value. See Notes 1, 7 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Bank's investment in bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) increased to $18.1 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $15.6 million at December 31, 2015. The investment returns from BOLI are utilized to offset a portion of the cost of providing benefit plans to certain employees.\nGoodwill was $4.2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is tested for impairment annually. The Company's most recent annual impairment test determined there was no goodwill impairment. Identifiable intangible assets were $1.6 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $1.9 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting the core deposit intangible ( CDI\u201d) associated with a prior period branch acquisition transaction, which is being amortized over a ten year period. See Notes 1 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n 47 \nMSRs increased to $2.1 million at December 31, 2016, from $1.3 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, the Bank purchased the MSRs of 452 high-quality Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans with an unpaid principal balance of $84.6 million. The selection of these mortgage loans to service was based on their quality as well as their geographic location. All of the loans acquired were current as to payment on the purchase date and the Bank had the ability to push-back any loans that prepaid or became delinquent within 90 days. In addition, all of these loans are located in the state of North Carolina and a significant portion of the borrowers reside within the Bank's footprint. Mortgage loans serviced for others increased to $372.0 million at December 31, 2016, from $297.5 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to these acquired loans.\nPrepaid expenses and other assets were $8.4 million at December 31, 2016, versus $8.3 million at December 31, 2015, primarily reflecting changes and adjustments in our deferred tax asset. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Non-Interest Expense below for additional information.\nTotal deposits increased by $59.3 million to $870.6 million at December 31, 2016, from $811.3 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, non-maturity deposits including noninterest bearing accounts, savings accounts and interest bearing demand accounts grew by $27.4 million, $9.7 million and $25.7 million, respectively, and were partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in certificates of deposit. Certificates of deposit represented 29.5% of total deposits at December 31, 2016, compared to 32.1% at December 31, 2015. Noninterest bearing accounts increased to 22.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2016, from 20.9% at December 31, 2015. The Bank strives to manage its cost of deposits through a combination of monitoring the volume and pricing of new and maturing CDs and growth in non-maturity deposits, in relationship to current funding needs and market interest rates. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Interest Expense below for additional information.\nFHLB borrowings declined by $20.0 million to $17.0 million at December 31, 2016, from $37.0 million at December 31, 2015. The Bank uses FHLB borrowings as a funding source to provide an effective means of managing its overall cost of funds and to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. There was $10.3 million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Part I - Item 1. Business-Deposit Activity and Other Sources of Funds-Borrowings\u201d above, and Notes 13 and 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nStockholders' equity increased by $5.0 million to $87.2 million at December 31, 2016, from $82.2 million at December 31, 2015. This increase reflects the $7.0 million of net income earned for the year ended December 31, 2016, net of a $938,000 decline in accumulated other comprehensive income and $1.1 million of cash dividends declared. Accumulated other comprehensive income totaled $1.4 million at December 31, 2016, versus $2.4 million at December 31, 2015. See Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Notes 1 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe growth in equity coupled with a reduction in the Bank's CDI resulted in an increase in tangible equity. As such, the tangible book value per common share increased to $8.576 at December 31, 2016, from $8.02 at December 31, 2015, and the tangible equity to assets ratio increased to 8.21% at December 31, 2016, from 8.04% at December 31, 2015.\nThere were 9,494,935 common shares outstanding at December 31, 2016, compared to 9,489,222 shares outstanding at December 31, 2015, reflecting the effect of 3,475 shares issued pursuant to the vesting of restricted stock awards and 2,238 shares issued pursuant to stock options exercised during 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividend payments. The continued payment of cash dividends reflects the strong capital position of the Company, sound and improved financial performance and our desire to provide additional value to our stockholders. The Board will continue to review the status of future dividend payments, which will depend upon the Company's financial condition, earnings, equity structure, capital needs and economic conditions.\n 48 \nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by its federal and state banking regulators. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank's regulatory capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements and the Bank's regulatory capital position was categorized as well capitalized\u201d. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2016, that management believes have changed the Bank's well capitalized\u201d category. See Part I, Item 1. Business - Depository Institution Regulation - Capital Requirements\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d above and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nGeneral. The Company reported a 48.6% increase in net income to $7.0 million for 2016, from $4.7 million for 2015. Net income per diluted common share increased to $0.73 per share for 2016, from $0.49 per share for 2015. The improvement in earnings for 2016 was positively impacted by increases in net interest income and non-interest income, as well as a lower volume of non-interest expense, while being partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses associated with the strong loan portfolio growth. In addition, during the first quarter of 2015, the Bank incurred $425,000 of one-time pre-tax transaction expenses associated with acquiring nine branch offices in mid-December of 2014.\nKey Performance Ratios. Key performance ratios are return on average assets ( ROA\u201d), return on average equity ( ROE\u201d) and efficiency. For 2016, ROA and ROE improved to 0.72% and 8.02%, respectively, from 0.52% and 5.72%, respectively, for 2015. The efficiency ratio (non-interest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus non-interest income) also improved to 76.51% for 2016, from 84.53% for 2015. The efficiency ratio measures the proportion of net operating revenues that are absorbed by overhead expenses. The efficiency ratio was elevated for 2015 due primarily to franchise expansion. We anticipate the efficiency ratio to improve over time as the investments we have made in staffing and infrastructure are able to generate a larger earning asset base and an increased level of earnings.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased to $36.2 million for 2016, from $32.5 million for 2015. The year-over-year growth in interest income is due primarily to changes in the composition and volume of our earning asset base, coupled with an increase in yields on earning assets, as we have replaced lower yielding investments with higher yielding loans. Average earning assets increased during 2016 to $889.6 million, from $822.6 million for 2015, primarily reflecting the strong growth in the level of our loans and leases held for investment during the current year. We have also experienced an increase in yields on earning assets over comparative periods. The tax equivalent yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 4.11% for 2016, from 4.01% for 2015.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $3.6 million for 2016, from $3.1 million for 2015. This change in interest expense was primarily the result of an increased volume of average interest bearing liabilities that were utilized to support earnings asset growth. Interest expense was also impacted by a five basis point increase in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased to $691.6 million for 2016, from $653.1 million for 2015. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased to $177.0 million for 2016, from $158.0 million for 2015. These combined increases reflect the impact of prior period branch acquisitions, as well as organic growth during 2016. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.52% for 2016, from 0.47% for the comparative 2015 annual period. The Bank has strived to manage its funding cost through a combination of growing noninterest bearing demand deposits and lower costing non-maturity deposits. In addition, the Bank has restructured its FHLB advances in order to extend some maturities to provide protection in a rising rate environment and a reduced the interest rate paid on junior subordinated notes. These savings were partially offset by additional cost on the longer-term portion of our CD portfolio.\nEffective December 30, 2014, the Company swapped the interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures from three-month LIBOR plus 2.95%, to a fixed rate of 5.54% for the ensuing five year period. This strategy was executed to provide the Company with protection in the event of a rising rate environment. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company restructured the terms of this swap to lower the fixed rate cost and extend its maturity. As a result, the restructured fixed rate effective as of June 30, 2016, is 4.97% and the maturity date of the swap is December 30, 2024.\n 49 \nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended 2016 increased to $32.6 million, a $3.2 million or 10.9% increase, versus the $29.4 million generated during the year ended 2015. The tax equivalent net interest margin for the year ended 2016 increased to 3.71%, from 3.64% for the year ended 2015.\nThe improvement in the tax-equivalent net interest margin is due to higher volumes of average earning assets and the change in the mix of our earning assets, as we have replaced lower yielding investments with higher yielding loans. On the liability side of the balance sheet, while we continue to seek expansion of our non-maturity deposit base, we have also taken steps to protect the Company from a rising rate environment by adding some longer-term funding. We continue to balance our customers' desires to maintain liquidity in their deposit selection with the possibility of a rising rate environment. During 2016, customers have moved more funds into lower cost non-maturity and short-term CD's. We anticipate the level of our current margin remaining somewhat stable over the near-term, unless there are dramatic movements in interest rates. See Table 2 - Rate/Volume Analysis\u201d and Table 3 - Yield/Cost Analysis\u201d above for additional information on interest income, interest expense, net interest income, average balances and yield/cost ratios.\nProvision for Credit Losses. The Bank recorded $970,000 of provisions for credit losses in 2016, compared to $800,000 for 2015. The Bank's methodology for determining its provision for credit losses includes amounts specifically allocated to credits that are individually determined to be impaired, as well as general provisions allocated to groups of loans that have not been individually assessed for impairment. The increase in provision for credit losses is primarily attributable to support the net growth in loans and leases held for investment during 2016, as previously discussed. Provisions for credit losses are necessary to maintain the ALLL at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb probable future losses in the loan portfolio. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Lending Activities-Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d and Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNon-Interest Income. Total non-interest income was $14.2 million for 2016, compared to $14.3 million for 2015. Non-interest income consists of deposit fees and service charges; loan fees and charges; mortgage loan servicing fees; gain on sale and other fees on mortgage loans, gain on sales of investment securities and OREO; and other miscellaneous income. The Bank strives to maintain consistency of its non-interest income earned across both deposit and loan service offerings. Fees and service charges on deposits, and fees on loans and loan servicing fees earned during each period are influenced by the volume of deposits and loans outstanding, the volume of the various types of deposit and loan account transactions processed, the volume of loans serviced for others and the collection of related fees and service charges.\nDeposit fees and service charges, the largest component of non-interest income, totaled $7.6 million for 2016, versus $8.1 million earned in 2015. Deposit fees and service charges represented 53.5% of total non-interest income for 2016, compared to 56.5% for 2015. The amount of service charges and fees is generally dependent upon the volume of account transaction activity and the collection of related service charges and fees. Deposit fees and service charges have been enhanced from historical levels as accounts acquired in the 2014 branch acquisition transaction, as well as from the introduction of new products and product enhancements. We anticipate stable service charge revenue from deposits going forward as we focus on growing our core deposit base through new quality customer relationships.\nThe Bank's mortgage division generates revenues through originations, sales and servicing of mortgage loans. Total non-interest income generated from the sale and servicing of mortgage loans and loan fees increased to $3.6 million in 2013, from $3.1 million for 2015. We anticipate the level of mortgage originations to remain consistent, with the overall economic climate improving in the Bank's market area. The Bank sells the majority of its originated mortgage loans and retains the servicing rights. The Bank may sell or securitize fixed-rate residential mortgage loans to reduce interest rate and credit risk exposure, and to provide a more balanced sensitivity to future interest rate changes, while retaining certain other held for sale mortgage loans for possible future securitization into available for sale mortgage-backed securities.\nThe Bank sold $44.3 million of mortgage loans held for sale in 2016, compared to $34.6 million sold in 2015. Loans serviced for others and MSRs were $372.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016, compared to $297.5 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2015. We will continue to explore various strategies to enhance our non-interest income, including the purchase of MSRs, as previously discussed. The future levels of gains on sales of mortgage loans and loan servicing fees are dependent on the pricing and volume of new mortgage loan originations.\n 50 \nGains from sales of investment securities available for sale were $467,000 for 2016, versus $1.4 million for 2015. As previously noted, in 2014 we implemented a strategy to pre-invest a large portion of the anticipated branch acquisition transaction proceeds into short and intermediate term investment securities, until the funds could be converted to higher yielding assets. The Bank sold $40.6 million of investment securities available for sale in 2016, compared to $46.2 million sold in 2015, primarily to fund our loan portfolio growth.\nIn its continued efforts of disposing of nonperforming assets, the Bank recorded net gains on sales of OREO properties of $131,000 for 2016, compared to $40,000 for 2015. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIncluded in other non-interest income is revenue from BOLI investments of $562,000 for 2016, compared to $510,000 for 2015. The Bank utilizes the investment returns from the BOLI to recover a portion of the cost of providing employee benefit plans.\nOther non-interest income for 2016 includes an increase in SBA related revenue to $520,000 for 2016, from $55,000 for 2015. While the Bank has originated SBA loans in prior years, we only began the process of actively selling and servicing these credits during the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, other income for 2016 includes a $230,000 non-recurring payment to the Bank.\nTotal core non-interest income, excluding net gains and losses from OREO and investment securities sales, increased to $13.6 million for 2016, from $12.8 million for 2015.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Total non-interest expenses for 2016 declined by $473,000 to $35.9 million, from $36.4 million for 2015.\nCompensation and benefits expense, the largest component of non-interest expenses, increased to $19.8 million for 2016, from $19.4 million reported in 2015. During 2016, the Bank consolidated three existing branches into nearby locations, and incurred $65,000 of severance costs associated with these branch consolidations. The Bank will continue to manage staffing levels to ensure we meet the ongoing needs of our customers and to support our future growth.\nPremises and equipment expense increased to $5.5 million for 2016, from $5.3 million reported in 2015. Premises and equipment expense for 2016 includes the retirement of certain leasehold improvements and other fixed assets at the branch locations that were consolidated and closed. We will continue to explore opportunities to gain efficiency and performance improvement from our branch network.\nThe cost of FDIC insurance increased to $632,000 for 2016, from to $609,000 reported in 2015. The increase in FDIC insurance premiums during 2016 was due to the growth in our balance sheet.\nMarketing expense for 2016 declined to $702,000, from $820,000 reported in 2015. The Bank continues to invest in building our brand awareness throughout our expanded footprint with its marketing efforts. We anticipate that marketing expenses will remain at or below current levels as we look to take a more product targeted approach.\nData processing costs for 2016 declined to $3.1 million, from $3.6 million for 2015, as the Bank has renegotiated its contract with its third party processing provider. Data processing expense for 2015 included $173,000 of one-time branch acquisition expenses. Data processing costs fluctuate in conjunction with changes in the number of customer accounts and transaction activity volumes. As we continue to focus on new customer acquisition and to invest in emerging technology to better serve our customer base, we anticipate that data processing costs may increase in support of future growth.\nTotal amortization of intangible assets, including MSRs and identifiable intangible assets, increased to $571,000 for 2016, from $515,000 for 2015. Amortization of MSRs was $287,000 for 2016, compared to $228,000 for 2015, as the Bank purchased additional MSRs mid-way through the current year. Amortization of the Company's CDI, which is the only identifiable intangible asset subject to amortization, was $284,000 for 2016, compared to $287,000 for the 2015. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n 51 \nTotal expenses attributable to ongoing maintenance, property taxes and insurance and valuation adjustments for OREO properties was reduced to $553,000 for 2016, from $632,000 for 2015. OREO valuation adjustments included therein were $250,000 for 2016, compared to $195,000 for 2015. See Notes 1 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Management continuously analyzes the carrying value of OREO and makes valuation adjustments as necessary.\nOther non-interest expense declined to $5.1 million for 2016, compared to $5.5 million for 2015. As previously discussed, during 2016 the Bank consolidated three existing branches into nearby locations. Two of these locations were leased and the third was owned. During 2016, the Bank entered into a contract to sell the owned location and realized an $85,000 pre-tax loss as a result. Other expense for 2015 included $180,000 of one-time branch acquisition expenses.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense increased to $3.0 million for 2016, from $1.8 million for 2015. Changes in the amount of income tax expense reflect changes in pretax income, deductible expenses, the application of permanent and temporary differences and the applicable income tax rates in effect during each period. Income taxes for 2016 and 2015 includes a $74,000 and $80,000 expense adjustment, respectively, due a write down of our deferred tax asset, as a result of a reduction in the North Carolina statutory tax rates for each respective year. The effective income tax rates were 29.8% for 2016, compared to 28.2% for 2015. The Bank's investment in BOLI and tax-exempt municipal bonds contribute to more favorable effective income tax rates, which has been partially offset by the strong growth in the loan portfolio.\nThe North Carolina State Legislature (the Legislature\u201d) enacted significant tax reform in 2013 for lowering the state's corporate income tax rates. The state corporate income tax rate for 2014 was reduced from 6.9% to 6.0%; was reduced to 5.0% for 2015; was reduced to 4.0% for 2016; and"}
