Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the \"Selected Historical Financial Information\" and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in \"Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Business - Operations - Environmental Matters and Regulation;\" \"Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Business - Operations - Other Regulation of the Oil and Gas\nIndustry;\" and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" above, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nOverview\nWe develop oil and natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. We seek to build stockholder value by delivering profitable growth in cash flow, reserves and production through the development of oil and natural gas assets. In order to deliver profitable growth, we allocate capital to our highest return assets, concentrate expenditures on exploiting our core assets, maintain capital discipline and optimize operations while upholding high-level standards for health, safety and the environment. Substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil and natural gas production and NGL recovery at market prices.\nWe are committed to developing and producing oil and natural gas in a responsible and safe manner. Our employees work diligently with regulatory agencies, as well as environmental, wildlife and community organizations, to ensure that exploration and development activities meet stakeholders' expectations and regulatory requirements.\nFuture acquisitions or dispositions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations by increasing or decreasing our reserves, production and revenues as well as expenses and future capital expenditures. We currently anticipate that we would finance any future acquisitions with available borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility, sales of properties, and/or the issuance of debt, equity or equity-linked securities. Our prior acquisitions and capital expenditures were financed with a combination of cash on hand, funding from the sale of our equity securities, our Amended Credit Facility, other debt financing and cash flows from operations.\nAs a result of acquisitions and dispositions of properties, our historical results of operations and period-to-period comparisons of these results and certain financial data may not be meaningful. In addition, past results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated net proved reserves and related Standardized Measure for the years indicated. The Standardized Measure is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated net proved reserves (MMBoe)\n</td> <td>127.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standardized measure (1) (in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>973.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,276.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>829.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019 reserves were based on average prices of $55.85 WTI per Bbl of oil, $2.58 Henry Hub per Mcf of natural gas and a percentage of the of the average oil price per Bbl of NGL. December 31, 2018 reserves were based on average prices of $65.56 WTI for oil, $3.10 Henry Hub for natural gas and $32.71 for NGLs. December 31, 2017 reserves were based on average prices of $51.34 WTI for oil, $2.98 Henry Hub for natural gas and $27.40 for NGLs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommodity prices are inherently volatile and are influenced by many factors outside of our control. As of February 4, 2020, we have hedged 5,857,500 barrels of oil, or approximately 54% of our expected 2020 production, and 1,912,500 barrels of oil for our 2021 production at price levels that provide some economic certainty to our cash flows. We focus our efforts on increasing oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long-term operations. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent on our ability to manage our revenues and overall cost structure to a level that allows for profitable production.\nWe operate in one industry segment, which is the development and production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and all of our operations are conducted in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Consequently, we currently report a single reportable segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of the closing of the Merger on March 19, 2018, Fifth Creek's revenues and expenses are included in the Audited Consolidated Statement of Operations beginning on March 19, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe

</tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Included in general and administrative expense is long-term cash and equity incentive compensation of $8.6 million (or $0.69 per Boe) and $7.2 million (or $0.71 per Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduction Revenues and Volumes. Production revenues decreased to $452.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $452.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in production revenues was due to a 19% decrease in the average realized prices per Boe before hedging, offset by a 23% increase in production volumes. The decrease in average realized prices per Boe before hedging decreased production revenues by approximately $86.0 million, while the increase in production volumes increased production revenues by approximately $85.4 million.\nTotal production volumes of 12.5 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from 10.2 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of new wells placed into production throughout 2019.\nLease Operating Expense (\"LOE\"). LOE increased to $3.01 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $2.74 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily related to higher initial LOE related to our early development program in the Hereford field.\nGathering, Transportation and Processing (\"GTP\") Expense. GTP expense increased to $0.85 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $0.46 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCosts incurred to gather, transport and/or process our oil, gas and NGLs prior to the transfer of control to the customer are included in GTP expense. Costs incurred to gather, transport and/or process our oil, gas and NGLs after control has transferred to the customer are considered components of the consideration received from the customer and thus recorded in oil, gas and NGL production revenues. In general, based on specific contract arrangements, costs incurred associated with gas and NGLs in the Hereford Field are included in GTP expense and costs incurred associated with gas and NGLs in the Northeast Wattenberg Field are included in production revenues. Costs incurred associated with oil are included in production revenues for both areas. See the \"Revenue Recognition\" section in Note 2 for additional information.\nGTP expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $0.85 per Boe is primarily associated with the Hereford Field. We expect GTP expense per Boe to increase in the future as we further develop and increase our production from the Hereford Field under the existing contractual arrangement, which has a primary term through April 2027.\nProduction Tax Expense. Total production taxes decreased to $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Production taxes are primarily based on the wellhead values of production, which exclude gains and losses associated with hedging activities. Production taxes as a percentage of oil, natural gas and NGL sales before hedging adjustments were 5.2% and 8.1% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to a decrease in our projected 2019 Colorado severance tax effective rate.\nImpairment and Abandonment Expense. Impairment and abandonment expense increased to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Impairment and abandonment expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 included leases that have expired and certain leases that will expire subsequent to the balance sheet date that the Company does not plan to renew. Impairment and abandonment expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 included leases that have expired.\nWe review our oil and natural gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. Whenever we conclude the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our oil and gas properties using proved and risked probable and possible reserves based on our development plans and best estimate of future production, commodity pricing, reserve risking, gathering and transportation deductions, production tax rates, lease operating expenses and future development costs. We compare such undiscounted future net cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the undiscounted future net cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties, no impairment is taken. If the carrying amount of a property exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows, we will impair the carrying value to fair value based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors existing as of the balance sheet date. The factors used to determine fair value may include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, indications from marketing activities, the present value of future revenues, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the projected cash flows.\nUnproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks, future plans to develop acreage, recent sales prices of comparable properties and other relevant matters. We generally expect impairments of unproved properties to be more likely to occur in periods of low commodity prices because we will be less likely to devote capital to exploration activities.\nGiven current and projected future commodity prices, we will continue to review our acreage position and future drilling plans. In addition, we will assess the carrying value of our properties relative to their estimated future net cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows from our properties are based on our aggregate best estimates of future production, commodity pricing, gathering and transportation deducts, production tax rates, lease operating expenses and future development costs as of the balance sheet date.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\"). DD&A increased to $321.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with $228.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $92.8 million was the result of a 23% increase in production and a 14% increase in the DD&A rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in production accounted for a $53.2 million increase in DD&A expense while the increase in the DD&A rate accounted for a $39.6 million increase in DD&A expense.\nUnder successful efforts accounting, depletion expense is calculated using the units-of-production method on the basis of some reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. The capital expenditures for proved properties for each field compared to the proved reserves corresponding to each producing field determine a depletion rate for current production. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the relationship of capital expenditures, proved reserves and production from certain producing fields yielded a depletion rate of $25.62 per Boe compared with $22.46 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the depletion rate of 14% is the result of year end 2018 reserve adjustments.\nUnused Commitments. Unused commitments expense of $17.7 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to gas transportation contracts. During March 2010, we entered into two firm natural gas pipeline transportation contracts to provide a guaranteed outlet for production from the West Tavaputs area of the Uinta Basin and the Gibson Gulch area of the Piceance Basin. These transportation contracts were not included in the sales of these assets in December 2013 and September 2014, respectively. Both firm transportation contracts require the pipeline to provide transportation capacity and require us to pay monthly transportation charges regardless of the amount of pipeline capacity utilized. The agreements expire July 31, 2021.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense decreased to $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. General and administrative expense on a per Boe basis decreased to $3.57 for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $4.44 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncluded in general and administrative expense is long-term cash and equity incentive compensation of $8.6 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The components of long-term cash and equity incentive compensation for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are shown in the following table:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonvested common stock\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonvested common stock units\n</td> <td>1,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonvested performance cash units (1)\n</td> <td>844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The nonvested performance cash units are accounted for as liability awards and will be settled in cash for the performance metrics that are met.

Merger transaction expense was $4.5 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Transaction expenses included severance, consulting, advisory, legal and other merger-related fees that were not capitalized as part of the Merger.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility. See Note 5 for additional information.\nCommodity Derivative Gain (Loss). Commodity derivative loss was $99.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with a gain of $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The gain or loss on commodity derivatives is related to fluctuations of oil and natural gas future pricing compared to actual pricing of commodity hedges in place as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 or during the periods then ended.\nThe fair value of our open but not yet settled derivative contracts is based on an income approach using various assumptions, such as quoted forward prices for commodities, risk-free discount rates, volatility factors and time value factors. The mark-to-market fair value of the open commodity derivative contracts will generally be inversely related to the price movement of the underlying commodity. If commodity price trends reverse from period to period, prior unrealized gains may become unrealized losses and vice versa. Higher underlying commodity price volatility will generally lead to higher volatility in our unrealized gains and losses and, by association, the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts. These unrealized gains and losses will impact our net income in the period reported. The mark-to-market fair value can create non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility. We have experienced such volatility in the past and are likely to experience it in the future. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues.\nThe table below summarizes our commodity derivative gains and losses that were recognized in the periods presented:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gain (loss) on derivatives (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(47,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior year unrealized (gain) loss transferred to realized (gain) loss (1)\n</td> <td>(81,166\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives (1)\n</td> <td>(28,454\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commodity derivative gain (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98,953\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives are presented herein as separate line items but are combined for a total commodity derivative gain (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Management believes the separate presentation of the realized and unrealized commodity derivative gains and losses is useful because the realized cash settlement portion provides a better understanding of our hedge position. We also believe that this disclosure allows for a more accurate comparison to our peers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2019, approximately 88% of our oil volumes and 19% of our natural gas volumes were subject to financial hedges, which resulted in an increase in oil income of $11.7 million and a decrease in natural gas income of $1.0 million after settlements. In 2018, approximately 73% of our oil volumes and 14% of our natural gas volumes were covered by financial hedges, which resulted in a decrease in oil revenues of $47.7 million and an increase natural gas revenues of $0.1 million after settlements.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets. This determination was made by considering all available evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, assets acquired in connection with the Merger and their classification as proved or unproved, current and projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. In making this assessment, judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets. This determination was made by considering all available evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Such evidence included the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, assets acquired in connection with the Merger and their classification as proved or unproved, current and projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. In making this assessment, judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence.\nAs a result of the analysis conducted, we reversed the majority of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets and recorded income tax expense of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017\nA discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with December 31, 2017 can be found in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity since our formation have been net cash provided by operating activities, sales and other issuances of equity and debt securities, bank credit facilities, proceeds from sale-leasebacks, joint exploration agreements and sales of interests in properties. Our primary use of capital has been for the development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. As we pursue profitable reserves and production growth, we continually monitor the capital resources available to us to meet our future financial obligations, fund planned capital expenditure activities and ensure adequate liquidity. Our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources being available to us. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity available to us from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and under our Amended Credit Facility for our planned uses of capital over the next twelve months.\nThe Amended Credit Facility provides for a maximum credit amount of $1.5 billion, an initial elected commitment amount of $500.0 million, and an initial borrowing base of $500.0 million. On October 1, 2019, the commitment and borrowing base amounts were reaffirmed at $500.0 million. At December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $16.4 million and a $140.0 million balance outstanding under our Amended Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $32.8 million and no amounts outstanding under our Amended Credit Facility. Our effective borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2019 was reduced by $26.0 million to $334.0 million due to an outstanding irrevocable letter of credit related to a firm transportation agreement. The letter of credit will begin reducing ratably per month beginning April 1, 2020 until it expires on August 31, 2021.\nOn March 19, 2018, we completed the Merger with Fifth Creek. The Merger was effected through the issuance of 100 million shares of our common stock, with a fair value of $484.0 million on the date of closing, and the repayment of $53.9 million of Fifth Creek debt. See \"Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties - Business - Significant Business Developments - Merger with Fifth Creek Energy Operating Company, LLC\" for additional information.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $278.6 million, $231.4 million and $122.0 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The changes in net cash provided by operating activities are discussed above in \"Results of Operations\". The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2017 to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in production revenues.\nCommodity Hedging Activities\nOur operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which are the prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce. Prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. National and worldwide economic activity and political stability, weather, infrastructure capacity to reach markets, supply levels and other variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict.\nTo mitigate some of the potential negative impact on cash flow caused by changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, we have entered into financial commodity swap contracts to receive fixed prices for a portion of our production. At December 31, 2019, we had in place crude oil swaps covering portions of our 2020 and 2021 production.\nIn addition to financial contracts, we may at times enter into various physical commodity contracts for the sale of oil and natural gas that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions. These physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception and, therefore, are not subject to hedge or mark-to-market accounting. The financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in oil, gas and NGL production revenues at the time of settlement.\nAll derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchase and normal sales exception as mentioned above, are recorded at fair market value and are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities. All fair values are\nadjusted for non-performance risk. All changes in the derivative's fair value are recorded in earnings. These mark-to-market adjustments produce a degree of earnings volatility but have no cash flow impact relative to changes in market prices. Our cash flow is only impacted when the associated derivative instrument contract is settled by making a payment to or receiving a payment from the counterparty.\nThe following table includes all hedges entered into through February 4, 2020.\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nHedged\nVolumes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Quantity\nType\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nFixed Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Index\nPrice (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swap Contracts:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,857,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Bbls\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>WTI\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,912,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Bbls\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>WTI\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>WTI refers to West Texas Intermediate price as quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBy removing the price volatility from a portion of our oil revenue, we have mitigated, but not eliminated, the potential effects of changing prices on our operating cash flow for the relevant period. While mitigating negative effects of falling commodity prices, these derivative contracts also limit the benefits we would receive from increases in commodity prices.\nIt is our policy to enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that are lenders in the Amended Credit Facility, affiliates of lenders in the Amended Credit Facility or potential lenders in the Amended Credit Facility. Our derivative contracts are documented using an industry standard contract known as a Schedule to the Master Agreement and International Swaps and Derivative Association, Inc. (\"ISDA\") Master Agreement or other contracts. Typical terms for these contracts include credit support requirements, cross default provisions, termination events and set-off provisions. We are not required to provide any credit support to our counterparties other than cross collateralization with the properties securing the Amended Credit Facility. We have set-off provisions in our derivative contracts with lenders under our Amended Credit Facility which, in the event of a counterparty default, allow us to set-off amounts owed to the defaulting counterparty under the Amended Credit Facility or other obligations against monies owed to us under the derivative contracts. Where the counterparty is not a lender under the Amended Credit Facility, we may not be able to set-off amounts owed by us under the Amended Credit Facility, even if such counterparty is an affiliate of a lender under such facility.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures are summarized in the following tables for the periods indicated:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basin/Area\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DJ\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>355.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>508.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (1)(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>508.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions of proved and unproved properties and other real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drilling, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties\n</td> <td>319.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>448.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathering and compression facilities\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Geologic and geophysical costs\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture, fixtures and equipment\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (1)(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>508.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes exploration and abandonement expense, which are expensed under successful efforts accounting, of $5.9 million, $0.8 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Excludes $716.2 million related to the proved and unproved oil and gas properties and furniture, equipment and other assets acquired in the Merger for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties and other real estate were $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily related to acquisitions of proved and unproved properties in the DJ Basin. The decrease in drilling, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties to $319.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $448.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to a decrease in development drilling and completion activities within the DJ Basin. The increase in geologic and geophysical costs to $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 is related to activity in the Hereford field.\nCapital expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties and other real estate were $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily related to acquisitions of proved and unproved properties in the DJ Basin. The increase in drilling, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties to $448.9 million from $226.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to an increase in development drilling and completion activities within the DJ Basin, including drilling and completion activities associated with properties acquired in the Merger. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 exclude any amounts associated with the purchase price of the Merger.\nOur current estimated capital expenditure budget for 2020 is $200.0 million to $220.0 million. The budget includes facilities costs and excludes acquisitions. We may adjust capital expenditures as business conditions and operating results warrant. The amount, timing and allocation of capital expenditures is generally discretionary and within our control. If oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline to below acceptable levels or costs increase above acceptable levels, we could choose to defer a portion of our budgeted capital expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity. We would generally do this by prioritizing capital projects to first focus on those that we believe will have the highest expected financial returns and ability to generate near-term cash flow.\nWe believe that we have sufficient available liquidity with available cash on hand, cash under the Amended Credit Facility and cash flow from operations to fund our 2020 budgeted capital expenditures. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including our level of oil and natural gas production, commodity prices and operating costs. There can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide sufficient amounts of cash flow to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nMerger Financing. On March 19, 2018, we completed the Merger with Fifth Creek. The Merger was effected through the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of our common stock, with a fair value of $484.0 million, and the repayment of $53.9 million of Fifth Creek debt.\nAmended Credit Facility. We had $140.0 million and zero outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Amended Credit Facility provides for a maximum credit amount of $1.5 billion, an initial elected commitment amount of $500.0 million and an initial borrowing base of $500.0 million. On October 1, 2019, the commitment and borrowing base amounts were reaffirmed at $500.0 million. The current maturity date of the Amended Credit Facility is July 16, 2022. While the stated maturity date in the Amended Credit Facility is September 14, 2023,\nthe maturity date is accelerated if the Company has more than $100 million of \"Permitted Debt\" or \"Permitted Refinancing Debt\" (as those terms are defined in the Amended Credit Facility) that matures prior to December 14, 2023. If that is the case, the accelerated maturity date is 91 days prior to the earliest maturity of such Permitted Debt or Permitted Refinancing Debt. Because the Company's 7.0% Senior Notes will mature on October 15, 2022, the aggregate amount of those notes exceeds $100 million and the notes represent \"Permitted Debt\", the maturity date specified in the Amended Credit Facility is accelerated to the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of those notes, or July 16, 2022.\nBorrowing bases are computed based on proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, hedge positions and estimated future cash flows from those reserves calculated using future commodity pricing provided by our lenders, as well as any other outstanding debt. Lower commodity prices will generally result in a lower borrowing base.\nWe are in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2019 and have complied with all financial covenants since issuance. We expect to be in compliance with all financial covenants based on the 2020 budget at current commodity prices.\nOur outstanding debt is summarized below:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt Issuance Costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt Issuance Costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\nAmount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amended Credit Facility\n</td> <td>September 14, 2023\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.0% Senior Notes\n</td> <td>October 15, 2022\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,372\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8.75% Senior Notes\n</td> <td>June 15, 2025\n</td> <td>275,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,717\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,403\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease Financing Obligation\n</td> <td>August 10, 2020\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>765,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,089\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>758,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>626,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>619,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Current Portion of Long-Term Debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total Long-Term Debt (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>765,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,089\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>758,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>625,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>617,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018, the current portion of long-term debt included the Lease Financing Obligation, which was settled on February 10, 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>See Note 5 for additional information.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Ratings. Our credit risk is evaluated by two independent rating agencies based on publicly available information and information obtained during our ongoing discussions with the rating agencies. Moody's Investor Services and Standard & Poor's Rating Services currently rate our 7.0% Senior Notes and 8.75% Senior Notes and have assigned a credit rating.

The regulatory environment continues to become more restrictive, which limits our ability to, and increases the costs of, conducting our operations. Areas in which we operate are subject to federal, state and local regulations. Additional and more restrictive regulations have been seen at each of these governmental levels recently and there are initiatives underway to implement additional regulations and prohibitions on oil and gas activities. New rules may further impact our ability to obtain drilling permits and other required approvals in a timely manner and increase the costs of such permits or approvals. This may create substantial uncertainty about our production and capital expenditure targets. Efforts related to climate change organized around a \"keep it in the ground\" message have gained traction in New York and other coastal states, as well as internationally, notably in France and Germany. See \"Business and Properties-Operations-Environmental Matters and Regulation\" for a summary of certain environmental regulations that affect our business and related developments, including potential future regulatory developments.\nDeclining Commodity Prices. The severe decline in oil prices that occurred in 2014 and 2015 increased the volatility and amplitude of the other risks facing us as described in this report and had an impact on our business and financial condition. The significant decrease in oil prices in late 2018 and 2019 had a similar effect. If oil prices decrease from current levels, our planned drilling projects may become uneconomic, which could affect future drilling plans and growth rates. Low commodity prices impact our revenue, which we partially mitigate with our hedging program.\nThe sustained decline in commodity prices may also expose us to unexpected liability for plugging and abandoning wells, and associated reclamation, including for assets that were sold to other industry parties in prior years. If such third parties become unable to fulfill their contract obligations to us as provided for in purchase and sale agreements, regulatory agencies and landowners may demand that we perform such activities. Recent case law in Wyoming has increased such exposure for companies that have divested assets to no longer viable entities, and we have received demands from the Bureau of Land Management and a several large ranches to plug and abandon wells, and conduct associated reclamation, on properties we no longer own. We recognized $0.3 million and $1.9 million associated with these obligations in other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments below. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nOil and Gas Properties\nOur oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not find proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and remain within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. If an exploratory well does find proved reserves, the costs remain capitalized, are included within additions to oil and gas properties and remain within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether proved reserves are added or not. All exploratory wells are evaluated for economic viability within one year of well completion, and the related capitalized costs are reviewed quarterly. Exploratory wells that discover potentially economic reserves in areas where a major capital expenditure would be required before production could begin and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful\ncompletion of further exploratory work in the area remain capitalized if the well finds a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well, and we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated DD&A are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized. Interest cost is capitalized as a component of property cost for significant exploration and development projects that require greater than six months to be readied for their intended use.\nThe application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred. In addition to development on exploratory wells, we may drill scientific wells that are only used for data gathering purposes. The costs associated with these scientific wells are expensed as incurred as exploration expense. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze, and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience.\nOther exploration costs, including certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. The sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit-of-production amortization rate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts.\nUnproved oil and gas property costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties if the properties are subsequently determined to be productive or are assigned proved reserves. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without recognizing any gain until all costs are recovered. Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks, future plans to develop acreage, recent sales prices of comparable properties and other relevant matters.\nWe review our oil and natural gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. We estimate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our oil and gas properties using proved and risked probable and possible reserves based on our development plans and best estimate of future production, commodity pricing, reserve risking, gathering and transportation deductions, production tax rates, lease operating expenses and future development costs. We compare such undiscounted future net cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the undiscounted future net cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties, no impairment is taken. If the carrying amount of a property exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows, we will impair the carrying value to fair value based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors existing as of the balance sheet date. The factors used to determine fair value may include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, indications from marketing activities, the present value of future revenues, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the projected cash flows.\nOil and gas properties are assessed for impairment once they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying cost or fair value less costs to sell. The fair value of the assets is determined using a market approach, based on an estimated selling price, as evidenced by current marketing activities, if possible. If an estimated selling price is not available, we utilize the income valuation technique, which involves calculating the present value of future net cash flows, as discussed above. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value less costs to sell, an impairment will result to reduce the value of the properties down to fair value less costs to sell. The estimated fair value of assets held for sale may be materially different from sales proceeds that we eventually realize due to a number of factors including but not limited to the differences in expected future commodity pricing, location and quality differentials, our relative desire to dispose of such properties based on facts and circumstances impacting our business at the time we agree to sell, such as our position in the field subsequent to the sale and plans for future acquisitions or development in core areas.\nOur investment in producing oil and natural gas properties includes an estimate of the future costs associated with dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties. The present value of the estimated future costs to dismantle, abandon and restore a well location are added to the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties and recorded as a long-term liability. The capitalized cost is included in the oil and natural gas property costs that are depleted over the life of the assets.\nThe provision for depletion of oil and gas properties is calculated on a field-by-field basis using the units-of-production method. Natural gas and NGLs are converted to an oil equivalent, Boe, at the standard rate of six Mcf to one Boe and forty-two gallons to one Boe, respectively. Our rate of recording DD&A is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved\ndeveloped reserves, which incorporate assumptions regarding future development and abandonment costs as well as our level of capital spending. If the estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline, the rate at which we record DD&A expense increases, reducing our net income. This decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. We are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program, as well as future economic conditions.\nOil and Gas Reserve Quantities\nOur estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Our proved reserves estimates are audited on a well-by-well basis by an independent third party engineering firm. In the aggregate, the independent third party petroleum engineer estimates of total net proved reserves are within 10% of our internal estimates as of December 31, 2019.\nReserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations. As a result, adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserves estimates. We prepare our reserves estimates, and the projected cash flows derived from these reserves estimates, in accordance with SEC guidelines. Our independent third party engineering firm adheres to the same guidelines when auditing our reserve reports. The accuracy of our reserves estimates is a function of many factors including the following: the quality and quantity of available data, the interpretation of that data, the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the reserves estimates.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserves estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserves estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statements. As such, reserves estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of oil and natural gas eventually recovered.\nPlease refer to the reserve disclosures in \"Items 1 and 2 - Business and Properties\" for further detail on reserves data.\nRevenue Recognition\nAll of our sales of oil, gas and NGLs are made under contracts with customers, whereby revenues are recognized when we satisfy our performance obligations and the customer obtains control of the product. Performance obligations under our contracts with customers are typically satisfied at a point-in-time through monthly delivery of oil, gas and/or NGLs. Accordingly, at the end of the reporting period, we do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations. Our contracts with customers typically include variable consideration based on monthly pricing tied to local indices and volumes delivered in the current month. The nature of our contracts with customers do not require us to constrain variable consideration for accounting purposes. Our contracts with customers typically require payment within one month of delivery.\nUnder our contracts with customers, natural gas and its components, including NGLs, are either sold to a midstream entity (which processes the natural gas and subsequently sells the resulting residue gas and NGLs) or are sold to a gas or NGL purchaser after being processed by a third party for a fee. Regardless of the contract structure type, the terms of these contracts compensate us for the value of the residue gas and NGLs at current market prices for each product. Our oil is sold to multiple oil purchasers at specific delivery points at or near the wellhead. All costs incurred to gather, transport and/or process our oil, gas and NGLs after control has transferred to the customer are considered components of the consideration received from the customer and thus recorded in oil, gas and NGL production revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All costs incurred prior to the transfer of control to the customer are included in gathering, transportation and processing expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGas imbalances from the sale of natural gas are recorded on the basis of gas actually sold by us. If our aggregate sales volumes for a well are greater (or less) than its proportionate share of production from the well, a liability (or receivable) is established to the extent there are insufficient proved reserves available to make-up the overproduced (or underproduced) imbalance. Imbalances have not been significant in the periods presented.\nIncome Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions\nIncome taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when assets are recovered or liabilities are settled. Deferred income taxes are also recognized for net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes. Deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax rates to the differences between financial statement and income tax reporting. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider estimated future taxable income in making such assessments, including the future reversal of taxable temporary differences. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices). There can be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require us to adjust deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future.\nAccounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. Guidance is also provided regarding de-recognition, classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions. Based on this guidance, we regularly analyze tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on the threshold prescribed. Tax positions that do not meet or exceed this threshold are considered uncertain tax positions. Penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in other expenses. We currently do not have any uncertain tax positions recorded as of December 31, 2019.\nWe are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions, and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. If we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies. Conversely, we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. See \"Results of Operations- Income Tax (Expense) Benefit\" above for a discussion of changes to the valuation allowance during 2018.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor further information on the effects of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and the potential effects of new accounting pronouncements, refer to the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (in Note 2) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "summary": "- Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the \"Selected Historical Financial Information\" and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in \"Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Business - Operations - Environmental Matters and Regulation;\" \"Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Business - Operations - Other Regulation of the Oil and Gas\nIndustry;\" and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" above, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nOverview\nWe develop oil and natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. We seek to build stockholder value by delivering profitable growth in cash flow, reserves and production through the development of oil and natural gas assets. In order to deliver profitable growth, we allocate capital to our highest return assets, concentrate expenditures on exploiting our core assets, maintain capital discipline and optimize operations while upholding high-level standards for health, safety and the environment. Substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil and natural gas production and NGL recovery at market prices.\nWe are committed to developing and producing oil and natural gas in a responsible and safe manner. Our employees work diligently with regulatory agencies, as well as environmental, wildlife and community organizations, to ensure that exploration and development activities meet stakeholders' expectations and regulatory requirements.\nFuture acquisitions or dispositions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations by increasing or decreasing our reserves, production and revenues as well as expenses and future capital expenditures. We currently anticipate that we would finance any future acquisitions with available borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility, sales of properties, and/or the issuance of debt, equity or equity-linked securities. Our prior acquisitions and capital expenditures were financed with a combination of cash on hand, funding from the sale of our equity securities, our Amended Credit Facility, other debt financing and cash flows from operations.\nAs a result of acquisitions and dispositions of properties, our historical results of operations and period-to-period comparisons of these results and certain financial data may not be meaningful. In addition, past results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated net proved reserves and related Standardized Measure for the years indicated. The Standardized Measure is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\n\n (1) December 31, 2019 reserves were based on average prices of $55.85 WTI per Bbl of oil, $2.58 Henry Hub per Mcf of natural gas and a percentage of the of the average oil price per Bbl of NGL. December 31, 2018 reserves were based on average prices of $65.56 WTI for oil, $3.10 Henry Hub for natural gas and $32.71 for NGLs. December 31, 2017 reserves were based on average prices of $51.34 WTI for oil, $2.98 Henry Hub for natural gas and $27.40 for NGLs. \nCommodity prices are inherently volatile and are influenced by many factors outside of our control. As of February 4, 2020, we have hedged 5,857,500 barrels of oil, or approximately 54% of our expected 2020 production, and 1,912,500 barrels of oil for our 2021 production at price levels that provide some economic certainty to our cash flows. We focus our efforts on increasing oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long-term operations. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent on our ability to manage our revenues and overall cost structure to a level that allows for profitable production.\nWe operate in one industry segment, which is the development and production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and all of our operations are conducted in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Consequently, we currently report a single reportable segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of the closing of the Merger on March 19, 2018, Fifth Creek's revenues and expenses are included in the Audited Consolidated Statement of Operations beginning on March 19, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table sets forth selected operating data for the periods indicated:\n\n * Not meaningful. \n (1) Included in general and administrative expense is long-term cash and equity incentive compensation of $8.6 million (or $0.69 per Boe) and $7.2 million (or $0.71 per Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nProduction Revenues and Volumes. Production revenues decreased to $452.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $452.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in production revenues was due to a 19% decrease in the average realized prices per Boe before hedging, offset by a 23% increase in production volumes. The decrease in average realized prices per Boe before hedging decreased production revenues by approximately $86.0 million, while the increase in production volumes increased production revenues by approximately $85.4 million.\nTotal production volumes of 12.5 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from 10.2 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of new wells placed into production throughout 2019.\nLease Operating Expense (\"LOE\"). LOE increased to $3.01 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $2.74 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily related to higher initial LOE related to our early development program in the Hereford field.\nGathering, Transportation and Processing (\"GTP\") Expense. GTP expense increased to $0.85 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $0.46 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCosts incurred to gather, transport and/or process our oil, gas and NGLs prior to the transfer of control to the customer are included in GTP expense. Costs incurred to gather, transport and/or process our oil, gas and NGLs after control has transferred to the customer are considered components of the consideration received from the customer and thus recorded in oil, gas and NGL production revenues. In general, based on specific contract arrangements, costs incurred associated with gas and NGLs in the Hereford Field are included in GTP expense and costs incurred associated with gas and NGLs in the Northeast Wattenberg Field are included in production revenues. Costs incurred associated with oil are included in production revenues for both areas. See the \"Revenue Recognition\" section in Note 2 for additional information.\nGTP expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $0.85 per Boe is primarily associated with the Hereford Field. We expect GTP expense per Boe to increase in the future as we further develop and increase our production from the Hereford Field under the existing contractual arrangement, which has a primary term through April 2027.\nProduction Tax Expense. Total production taxes decreased to $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Production taxes are primarily based on the wellhead values of production, which exclude gains and losses associated with hedging activities. Production taxes as a percentage of oil, natural gas and NGL sales before hedging adjustments were 5.2% and 8.1% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to a decrease in our projected 2019 Colorado severance tax effective rate.\nImpairment and Abandonment Expense. Impairment and abandonment expense increased to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Impairment and abandonment expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 included leases that have expired and certain leases that will expire subsequent to the balance sheet date that the Company does not plan to renew. Impairment and abandonment expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 included leases that have expired.\nWe review our oil and natural gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. Whenever we conclude the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our oil and gas properties using proved and risked probable and possible reserves based on our development plans and best estimate of future production, commodity pricing, reserve risking, gathering and transportation deductions, production tax rates, lease operating expenses and future development costs. We compare such undiscounted future net cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the undiscounted future net cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties, no impairment is taken. If the carrying amount of a property exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows, we will impair the carrying value to fair value based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors existing as of the balance sheet date. The factors used to determine fair value may include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, indications from marketing activities, the present value of future revenues, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the projected cash flows.\nUnproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks, future plans to develop acreage, recent sales prices of comparable properties and other relevant matters. We generally expect impairments of unproved properties to be more likely to occur in periods of low commodity prices because we will be less likely to devote capital to exploration activities.\nGiven current and projected future commodity prices, we will continue to review our acreage position and future drilling plans. In addition, we will assess the carrying value of our properties relative to their estimated future net cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows from our properties are based on our aggregate best estimates of future production, commodity pricing, gathering and transportation deducts, production tax rates, lease operating expenses and future development costs as of the balance sheet date.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\"). DD&A increased to $321.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with $228.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $92.8 million was the result of a 23% increase in production and a 14% increase in the DD&A rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in production accounted for a $53.2 million increase in DD&A expense while the increase in the DD&A rate accounted for a $39.6 million increase in DD&A expense.\nUnder successful efforts accounting, depletion expense is calculated using the units-of-production method on the basis of some reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. The capital expenditures for proved properties for each field compared to the proved reserves corresponding to each producing field determine a depletion rate for current production. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the relationship of capital expenditures, proved reserves and production from certain producing fields yielded a depletion rate of $25.62 per Boe compared with $22.46 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the depletion rate of 14% is the result of year end 2018 reserve adjustments.\nUnused Commitments. Unused commitments expense of $17.7 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to gas transportation contracts. During March 2010, we entered into two firm natural gas pipeline transportation contracts to provide a guaranteed outlet for production from the West Tavaputs area of the Uinta Basin and the Gibson Gulch area of the Piceance Basin. These transportation contracts were not included in the sales of these assets in December 2013 and September 2014, respectively. Both firm transportation contracts require the pipeline to provide transportation capacity and require us to pay monthly transportation charges regardless of the amount of pipeline capacity utilized. The agreements expire July 31, 2021.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense decreased to $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. General and administrative expense on a per Boe basis decreased to $3.57 for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $4.44 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncluded in general and administrative expense is long-term cash and equity incentive compensation of $8.6 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The components of long-term cash and equity incentive compensation for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are shown in the following table:\n\n (1) The nonvested performance cash units are accounted for as liability awards and will be settled in cash for the performance metrics that are met. The expense for the period will increase or decrease based on updated fair values of these awards at each reporting date. \nMerger Transaction Expense. Merger transaction expense was $4.5 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Transaction expenses included severance, consulting, advisory, legal and other merger-related fees that were not capitalized as part of the Merger.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility. See Note 5 for additional information.\nCommodity Derivative Gain (Loss). Commodity derivative loss was $99.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with a gain of $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The gain or loss on commodity derivatives is related to fluctuations of oil and natural gas future pricing compared to actual pricing of commodity hedges in place as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 or during the periods then ended.\nThe fair value of our open but not yet settled derivative contracts is based on an income approach using various assumptions, such as quoted forward prices for commodities, risk-free discount rates, volatility factors and time value factors. The mark-to-market fair value of the open commodity derivative contracts will generally be inversely related to the price movement of the underlying commodity. If commodity price trends reverse from period to period, prior unrealized gains may become unrealized losses and vice versa. Higher underlying commodity price volatility will generally lead to higher volatility in our unrealized gains and losses and, by association, the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts. These unrealized gains and losses will impact our net income in the period reported. The mark-to-market fair value can create non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility. We have experienced such volatility in the past and are likely to experience it in the future. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues.\nThe table below summarizes our commodity derivative gains and losses that were recognized in the periods presented:\n\n (1) Realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives are presented herein as separate line items but are combined for a total commodity derivative gain (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This separate presentation is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes the separate presentation of the realized and unrealized commodity derivative gains and losses is useful because the realized cash settlement portion provides a better understanding of our hedge position. We also believe that this disclosure allows for a more accurate comparison to our peers. \nIn 2019, approximately 88% of our oil volumes and 19% of our natural gas volumes were subject to financial hedges, which resulted in an increase in oil income of $11.7 million and a decrease in natural gas income of $1.0 million after settlements. In 2018, approximately 73% of our oil volumes and 14% of our natural gas volumes were covered by financial hedges, which resulted in a decrease in oil revenues of $47.7 million and an increase natural gas revenues of $0.1 million after settlements.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets. This determination was made by considering all available evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, assets acquired in connection with the Merger and their classification as proved or unproved, current and projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. In making this assessment, judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets. This determination was made by considering all available evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Such evidence included the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, assets acquired in connection with the Merger and their classification as proved or unproved, current and projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. In making this assessment, judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence.\nAs a result of the analysis conducted, we reversed the majority of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets and recorded income tax expense of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017\nA discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with December 31, 2017 can be found in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity since our formation have been net cash provided by operating activities, sales and other issuances of equity and debt securities, bank credit facilities, proceeds from sale-leasebacks, joint exploration agreements and sales of interests in properties. Our primary use of capital has been for the development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. As we pursue profitable reserves and production growth, we continually monitor the capital resources available to us to meet our future financial obligations, fund planned capital expenditure activities and ensure adequate liquidity. Our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources being available to us. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity available to us from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and under our Amended Credit Facility for our planned uses of capital over the next twelve months.\nThe Amended Credit Facility provides for a maximum credit amount of $1.5 billion, an initial elected commitment amount of $500.0 million, and an initial borrowing base of $500.0 million. On October 1, 2019, the commitment and borrowing base amounts were reaffirmed at $500.0 million. At December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $16.4 million and a $140.0 million balance outstanding under our Amended Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $32.8 million and no amounts outstanding under our Amended Credit Facility. Our effective borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2019 was reduced by $26.0 million to $334.0 million due to an outstanding irrevocable letter of credit related to a firm transportation agreement. The letter of credit will begin reducing ratably per month beginning April 1, 2020 until it expires on August 31, 2021.\nOn March 19, 2018, we completed the Merger with Fifth Creek. The Merger was effected through the issuance of 100 million shares of our common stock, with a fair value of $484.0 million on the date of closing, and the repayment of $53.9 million of Fifth Creek debt. See \"Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties - Business - Significant Business Developments - Merger with Fifth Creek Energy Operating Company, LLC\" for additional information.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $278.6 million, $231.4 million and $122.0 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The changes in net cash provided by operating activities are discussed above in \"Results of Operations\". The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2017 to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in production revenues.\nCommodity Hedging Activities\nOur operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which are the prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce. Prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. National and worldwide economic activity and political stability, weather, infrastructure capacity to reach markets, supply levels and other variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict.\nTo mitigate some of the potential negative impact on cash flow caused by changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, we have entered into financial commodity swap contracts to receive fixed prices for a portion of our production. At December 31, 2019, we had in place crude oil swaps covering portions of our 2020 and 2021 production.\nIn addition to financial contracts, we may at times enter into various physical commodity contracts for the sale of oil and natural gas that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions. These physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception and, therefore, are not subject to hedge or mark-to-market accounting. The financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in oil, gas and NGL production revenues at the time of settlement.\nAll derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchase and normal sales exception as mentioned above, are recorded at fair market value and are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities. All fair values are\nadjusted for non-performance risk. All changes in the derivative's fair value are recorded in earnings. These mark-to-market adjustments produce a degree of earnings volatility but have no cash flow impact relative to changes in market prices. Our cash flow is only impacted when the associated derivative instrument contract is settled by making a payment to or receiving a payment from the counterparty.\nThe following table includes all hedges entered into through February 4, 2020.\n\n (1) WTI refers to West Texas Intermediate price as quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange. \nBy removing the price volatility from a portion of our oil revenue, we have mitigated, but not eliminated, the potential effects of changing prices on our operating cash flow for the relevant period. While mitigating negative effects of falling commodity prices, these derivative contracts also limit the benefits we would receive from increases in commodity prices.\nIt is our policy to enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that are lenders in the Amended Credit Facility, affiliates of lenders in the Amended Credit Facility or potential lenders in the Amended Credit Facility. Our derivative contracts are documented using an industry standard contract known as a Schedule to the Master Agreement and International Swaps and Derivative Association, Inc. (\"ISDA\") Master Agreement or other contracts. Typical terms for these contracts include credit support requirements, cross default provisions, termination events and set-off provisions. We are not required to provide any credit support to our counterparties other than cross collateralization with the properties securing the Amended Credit Facility. We have set-off provisions in our derivative contracts with lenders under our Amended Credit Facility which, in the event of a counterparty default, allow us to set-off amounts owed to the defaulting counterparty under the Amended Credit Facility or other obligations against monies owed to us under the derivative contracts. Where the counterparty is not a lender under the Amended Credit Facility, we may not be able to set-off amounts owed by us under the Amended Credit Facility, even if such counterparty is an affiliate of a lender under such facility.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures are summarized in the following tables for the periods indicated:\n\n\n (1) Includes exploration and abandonement expense, which are expensed under successful efforts accounting, of $5.9 million, $0.8 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n (2) Excludes $716.2 million related to the proved and unproved oil and gas properties and furniture, equipment and other assets acquired in the Merger for the year ended December 31, 2018. \nCapital expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties and other real estate were $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily related to acquisitions of proved and unproved properties in the DJ Basin. The decrease in drilling, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties to $319.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $448.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to a decrease in development drilling and completion activities within the DJ Basin. The increase in geologic and geophysical costs to $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 is related to activity in the Hereford field.\nCapital expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties and other real estate were $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily related to acquisitions of proved and unproved properties in the DJ Basin. The increase in drilling, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties to $448.9 million from $226.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to an increase in development drilling and completion activities within the DJ Basin, including drilling and completion activities associated with properties acquired in the Merger. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 exclude any amounts associated with the purchase price of the Merger.\nOur current estimated capital expenditure budget for 2020 is $200.0 million to $220.0 million. The budget includes facilities costs and excludes acquisitions. We may adjust capital expenditures as business conditions and operating results warrant. The amount, timing and allocation of capital expenditures is generally discretionary and within our control. If oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline to below acceptable levels or costs increase above acceptable levels, we could choose to defer a portion of our budgeted capital expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity. We would generally do this by prioritizing capital projects to first focus on those that we believe will have the highest expected financial returns and ability to generate near-term cash flow.\nWe believe that we have sufficient available liquidity with available cash on hand, cash under the Amended Credit Facility and cash flow from operations to fund our 2020 budgeted capital expenditures. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including our level of oil and natural gas production, commodity prices and operating costs. There can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide sufficient amounts of cash flow to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nMerger Financing. On March 19, 2018, we completed the Merger with Fifth Creek. The Merger was effected through the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of our common stock, with a fair value of $484.0 million, and the repayment of $53.9 million of Fifth Creek debt.\nAmended Credit Facility. We had $140.0 million and zero outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Amended Credit Facility provides for a maximum credit amount of $1.5 billion, an initial elected commitment amount of $500.0 million and an initial borrowing base of $500.0 million. On October 1, 2019, the commitment and borrowing base amounts were reaffirmed at $500.0 million. The current maturity date of the Amended Credit Facility is July 16, 2022. While the stated maturity date in the Amended Credit Facility is September 14, 2023,\nthe maturity date is accelerated if the Company has more than $100 million of \"Permitted Debt\" or \"Permitted Refinancing Debt\" (as those terms are defined in the Amended Credit Facility) that matures prior to December 14, 2023. If that is the case, the accelerated maturity date is 91 days prior to the earliest maturity of such Permitted Debt or Permitted Refinancing Debt. Because the Company's 7.0% Senior Notes will mature on October 15, 2022, the aggregate amount of those notes exceeds $100 million and the notes represent \"Permitted Debt\", the maturity date specified in the Amended Credit Facility is accelerated to the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of those notes, or July 16, 2022.\nBorrowing bases are computed based on proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, hedge positions and estimated future cash flows from those reserves calculated using future commodity pricing provided by our lenders, as well as any other outstanding debt. Lower commodity prices will generally result in a lower borrowing base.\nWe are in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2019 and have complied with all financial covenants since issuance. We expect to be in compliance with all financial covenants based on the 2020 budget at current commodity prices.\nOur outstanding debt is summarized below:\n\n (1) As of December 31, 2018, the current portion of long-term debt included the Lease Financing Obligation, which was settled on February 10, 2019. \n (2) See Note 5 for additional information. \nCredit Ratings. Our credit risk is evaluated by two independent rating agencies based on publicly available information and information obtained during our ongoing discussions with the rating agencies. Moody's Investor Services and Standard & Poor's Rating Services currently rate our 7.0% Senior Notes and 8.75% Senior Notes and have assigned a credit rating. We do not have any provisions that are linked to our credit ratings, nor do we have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of amounts due under our Amended Credit Facility, the 7.0% Senior Notes or the 8.75% Senior Notes. However, our ability to raise funds and the costs of any financing activities will be affected by our credit rating at the time any such financing activities are conducted.\nContractual Obligations. A summary of our contractual obligations as of and subsequent to December 31, 2019 is provided in the following table:\n\n (1) Included in notes payable is the outstanding principal amount under our Amended Credit Facility due September 14, 2023. This table does not include future commitment fees, interest expense or other fees on our Amended Credit Facility because the Amended Credit Facility is a floating rate instrument, and we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances, repayments or future interest rates to be charged. Also included in notes payable is interest on a $26.0 million letter of credit that accrues at 1.75% and 0.125% per annum for participation fees and fronting fees, respectively. The expected term for the letter of credit is January 31, 2020. \n (2) The aggregate principal amount of our 7.0% Senior Notes is $350.0 million. We are obligated to make semi-annual interest payments through maturity on October 15, 2022 equal to $12.3 million. See Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information. \n (3) On April 28, 2017, we issued $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes. We are obligated to make semi-annual interest payments through maturity on June 15, 2025 equal to $12.0 million. See Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information. \n (4) We have entered into contracts that provide firm transportation capacity on oil and gas pipeline systems. The contracts require us to pay transportation demand charges regardless of the amount we deliver to the processing facility or pipeline. \n (5) Includes a gas gathering and processing contract which requires us to deliver a minimum volume of natural gas to a midstream entity for gathering and processing on a monthly basis. The contract requires us to pay a fee associated with the contracted volumes regardless of the amount delivered. \n (6) Includes reimbursement obligations of $2.4 million. The reimbursement obligations require us to pay a monthly gathering and processing fee per Mcf of production to reimburse midstream entities for costs to construct gas gathering and processing facilities. If the costs are not reimbursed by us via the monthly gathering and processing fees, we must pay the difference. \n (7) Neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor the timing of our asset retirement obligations can be precisely determined in advance. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in estimating asset retirement obligations. \n (8) Derivative liability represents the net fair value for oil commodity derivatives presented as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019. The ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market fluctuations. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" in Part II, Item 7 and in \"Commodity Hedging Activities\" above for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in valuing derivative instruments. \n (9) Operating leases primarily includes office leases. Also included are leases of operations equipment which are shown as gross amounts that we are financially committed to pay. However, we will record in our financial statements our proportionate share based on our working interest, which will vary from property to property. \n (10) Primarily includes a fresh water commitment contract which requires us to purchase a minimum volume of fresh water from a supplier. The contract requires us to pay a fee associated with the contracted volumes regardless of the amount delivered. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nRegulatory Trends\nOur future Rockies operations and cost of doing business may be affected by changes in regulations and the ability to obtain drilling permits. The regulatory environment continues to become more restrictive, which limits our ability to, and increases the costs of, conducting our operations. Areas in which we operate are subject to federal, state and local regulations. Additional and more restrictive regulations have been seen at each of these governmental levels recently and there are initiatives underway to implement additional regulations and prohibitions on oil and gas activities. New rules may further impact our ability to obtain drilling permits and other required approvals in a timely manner and increase the costs of such permits or approvals. This may create substantial uncertainty about our production and capital expenditure targets. Efforts related to climate change organized around a \"keep it in the ground\" message have gained traction in New York and other coastal states, as well as internationally, notably in France and Germany. See \"Business and Properties-Operations-Environmental Matters and Regulation\" for a summary of certain environmental regulations that affect our business and related developments, including potential future regulatory developments.\nDeclining Commodity Prices. The severe decline in oil prices that occurred in 2014 and 2015 increased the volatility and amplitude of the other risks facing us as described in this report and had an impact on our business and financial condition. The significant decrease in oil prices in late 2018 and 2019 had a similar effect. If oil prices decrease from current levels, our planned drilling projects may become uneconomic, which could affect future drilling plans and growth rates. Low commodity prices impact our revenue, which we partially mitigate with our hedging program.\nThe sustained decline in commodity prices may also expose us to unexpected liability for plugging and abandoning wells, and associated reclamation, including for assets that were sold to other industry parties in prior years. If such third parties become unable to fulfill their contract obligations to us as provided for in purchase and sale agreements, regulatory agencies and landowners may demand that we perform such activities. Recent case law in Wyoming has increased such exposure for companies that have divested assets to no longer viable entities, and we have received demands from the Bureau of Land Management and a several large ranches to plug and abandon wells, and conduct associated reclamation, on properties we no longer own. We recognized $0.3 million and $1.9 million associated with these obligations in other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments below. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nOil and Gas Properties\nOur oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not find proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and remain within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. If an exploratory well does find proved reserves, the costs remain capitalized, are included within additions to oil and gas properties and remain within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether proved reserves are added or not. All exploratory wells are evaluated for economic viability within one year of well completion, and the related capitalized costs are reviewed quarterly. Exploratory wells that discover potentially economic reserves in areas where a major capital expenditure would be required before production could begin and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful\ncompletion of further exploratory work in the area remain capitalized if the well finds a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well, and we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated DD&A are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized. Interest cost is capitalized as a component of property cost for significant exploration and development projects that require greater than six months to be readied for their intended use.\nThe application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred. In addition to development on exploratory wells, we may drill scientific wells that are only used for data gathering purposes. The costs associated with these scientific wells are expensed as incurred as exploration expense. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze, and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience.\nOther exploration costs, including certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. The sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit-of-production amortization rate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts.\nUnproved oil and gas property costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties if the properties are subsequently determined to be productive or are assigned proved reserves. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without recognizing any gain until all costs are recovered. Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks, future plans to develop acreage, recent sales prices of comparable properties and other relevant matters.\nWe review our oil and natural gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. We estimate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our oil and gas properties using proved and risked probable and possible reserves based on our development plans and best estimate of future production, commodity pricing, reserve risking, gathering and transportation deductions, production tax rates, lease operating expenses and future development costs. We compare such undiscounted future net cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the undiscounted future net cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties, no impairment is taken. If the carrying amount of a property exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows, we will impair the carrying value to fair value based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors existing as of the balance sheet date. The factors used to determine fair value may include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, indications from marketing activities, the present value of future revenues, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the projected cash flows.\nOil and gas properties are assessed for impairment once they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying cost or fair value less costs to sell. The fair value of the assets is determined using a market approach, based on an estimated selling price, as evidenced by current marketing activities, if possible. If an estimated selling price is not available, we utilize the income valuation technique, which involves calculating the present value of future net cash flows, as discussed above. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value less costs to sell, an impairment will result to reduce the value of the properties down to fair value less costs to sell. The estimated fair value of assets held for sale may be materially different from sales proceeds that we eventually realize due to a number of factors including but not limited to the differences in expected future commodity pricing, location and quality differentials, our relative desire to dispose of such properties based on facts and circumstances impacting our business at the time we agree to sell, such as our position in the field subsequent to the sale and plans for future acquisitions or development in core areas.\nOur investment in producing oil and natural gas properties includes an estimate of the future costs associated with dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties. The present value of the estimated future costs to dismantle, abandon and restore a well location are added to the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties and recorded as a long-term liability. The capitalized cost is included in the oil and natural gas property costs that are depleted over the life of the assets.\nThe provision for depletion of oil and gas properties is calculated on a field-by-field basis using the units-of-production method. Natural gas and NGLs are converted to an oil equivalent, Boe, at the standard rate of six Mcf to one Boe and forty-two gallons to one Boe, respectively. Our rate of recording DD&A is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved\ndeveloped reserves, which incorporate assumptions regarding future development and abandonment costs as well as our level of capital spending. If the estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline, the rate at which we record DD&A expense increases, reducing our net income. This decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. We are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program, as well as future economic conditions.\nOil and Gas Reserve Quantities\nOur estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Our proved reserves estimates are audited on a well-by-well basis by an independent third party engineering firm. In the aggregate, the independent third party petroleum engineer estimates of total net proved reserves are within 10% of our internal estimates as of December 31, 2019.\nReserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations. As a result, adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserves estimates. We prepare our reserves estimates, and the projected cash flows derived from these reserves estimates, in accordance with SEC guidelines. Our independent third party engineering firm adheres to the same guidelines when auditing our reserve reports. The accuracy of our reserves estimates is a function of many factors including the following: the quality and quantity of available data, the interpretation of that data, the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the reserves estimates.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserves estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserves estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statements. As such, reserves estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of oil and natural gas eventually recovered.\nPlease refer to the reserve disclosures in \"Items 1 and 2 - Business and Properties\" for further detail on reserves data.\nRevenue Recognition\nAll of our sales of oil, gas and NGLs are made under contracts with customers, whereby revenues are recognized when we satisfy our performance obligations and the customer obtains control of the product. Performance obligations under our contracts with customers are typically satisfied at a point-in-time through monthly delivery of oil, gas and/or NGLs. Accordingly, at the end of the reporting period, we do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations. Our contracts with customers typically include variable consideration based on monthly pricing tied to local indices and volumes delivered in the current month. The nature of our contracts with customers do not require us to constrain variable consideration for accounting purposes. Our contracts with customers typically require payment within one month of", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the \"Selected Historical Financial Information\" and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in \"Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Business - Operations - Environmental Matters and Regulation;\" \"Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Business - Operations - Other Regulation of the Oil and Gas\nIndustry;\" and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" above, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nOverview\nWe develop oil and natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. We seek to build stockholder value by delivering profitable growth in cash flow, reserves and production through the development of oil and natural gas assets. In order to deliver profitable growth, we allocate capital to our highest return assets, concentrate expenditures on exploiting our core assets, maintain capital discipline and optimize operations while upholding high-level standards for health, safety and the environment. Substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil and natural gas production and NGL recovery at market prices.\nWe are committed to developing and producing oil and natural gas in a responsible and safe manner. Our employees work diligently with regulatory agencies, as well as environmental, wildlife and community organizations, to ensure that exploration and development activities meet stakeholders' expectations and regulatory requirements.\nFuture acquisitions or dispositions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations by increasing or decreasing our reserves, production and revenues as well as expenses and future capital expenditures. We currently anticipate that we would finance any future acquisitions with available borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility, sales of properties, and/or the issuance of debt, equity or equity-linked securities. Our prior acquisitions and capital expenditures were financed with a combination of cash on hand, funding from the sale of our equity securities, our Amended Credit Facility, other debt financing and cash flows from operations.\nAs a result of acquisitions and dispositions of properties, our historical results of operations and period-to-period comparisons of these results and certain financial data may not be meaningful. In addition, past results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated net proved reserves and related Standardized Measure for the years indicated. The Standardized Measure is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated net proved reserves (MMBoe)\n</td> <td>127.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standardized measure (1) (in millions)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>973.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,276.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>829.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) December 31, 2019 reserves were based on average prices of $55.85 WTI per Bbl of oil, $2.58 Henry Hub per Mcf of natural gas and a percentage of the of the average oil price per Bbl of NGL. December 31, 2018 reserves were based on average prices of $65.56 WTI for oil, $3.10 Henry Hub for natural gas and $32.71 for NGLs. December 31, 2017 reserves were based on average prices of $51.34 WTI for oil, $2.98 Henry Hub for natural gas and $27.40 for NGLs. \nCommodity prices are inherently volatile and are influenced by many factors outside of our control. As of February 4, 2020, we have hedged 5,857,500 barrels of oil, or approximately 54% of our expected 2020 production, and 1,912,500 barrels of oil for our 2021 production at price levels that provide some economic certainty to our cash flows. We focus our efforts on increasing oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long-term operations. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent on our ability to manage our revenues and overall cost structure to a level that allows for profitable production.\nWe operate in one industry segment, which is the development and production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and all of our operations are conducted in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Consequently, we currently report a single reportable segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of the closing of the Merger on March 19, 2018, Fifth Creek's revenues and expenses are included in the Audited Consolidated Statement of Operations beginning on March 19, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe

million (or $0.71 per Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nProduction Revenues and Volumes. Production revenues decreased to $452.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $452.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in production revenues was due to a 19% decrease in the average realized prices per Boe before hedging, offset by a 23% increase in production volumes. The decrease in average realized prices per Boe before hedging decreased production revenues by approximately $86.0 million, while the increase in production volumes increased production revenues by approximately $85.4 million.\nTotal production volumes of 12.5 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from 10.2 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of new wells placed into production throughout 2019.\nLease Operating Expense (\"LOE\"). LOE increased to $3.01 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $2.74 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily related to higher initial LOE related to our early development program in the Hereford field.\nGathering, Transportation and Processing (\"GTP\") Expense. GTP expense increased to $0.85 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $0.46 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCosts incurred to gather, transport and/or process our oil, gas and NGLs prior to the transfer of control to the customer are included in GTP expense. Costs incurred to gather, transport and/or process our oil, gas and NGLs after control has transferred to the customer are considered components of the consideration received from the customer and thus recorded in oil, gas and NGL production revenues. In general, based on specific contract arrangements, costs incurred associated with gas and NGLs in the Hereford Field are included in GTP expense and costs incurred associated with gas and NGLs in the Northeast Wattenberg Field are included in production revenues. Costs incurred associated with oil are included in production revenues for both areas. See the \"Revenue Recognition\" section in Note 2 for additional information.\nGTP expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $0.85 per Boe is primarily associated with the Hereford Field. We expect GTP expense per Boe to increase in the future as we further develop and increase our production from the Hereford Field under the existing contractual arrangement, which has a primary term through April 2027.\nProduction Tax Expense. Total production taxes decreased to $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Production taxes are primarily based on the wellhead values of production, which exclude gains and losses associated with hedging activities. Production taxes as a percentage of oil, natural gas and NGL sales before hedging adjustments were 5.2% and 8.1% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to a decrease in our projected 2019 Colorado severance tax effective rate.\nImpairment and Abandonment Expense. Impairment and abandonment expense increased to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Impairment and abandonment expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 included leases that have expired and certain leases that will expire subsequent to the balance sheet date that the Company does not plan to renew. Impairment and abandonment expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 included leases that have expired.\nWe review our oil and natural gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. Whenever we conclude the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our oil and gas properties using proved and risked probable and possible reserves based on our development plans and best estimate of future production, commodity pricing, reserve risking, gathering and transportation deductions, production tax rates, lease operating expenses and future development costs. We compare such undiscounted future net cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the undiscounted future net cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties, no impairment is taken. If the carrying amount of a property exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows, we will impair the carrying value to fair value based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors existing as of the balance sheet date. The factors used to determine fair value may include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, indications from marketing activities, the present value of future revenues, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the projected cash flows.\nUnproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks, future plans to develop acreage, recent sales prices of comparable properties and other relevant matters. We generally expect impairments of unproved properties to be more likely to occur in periods of low commodity prices because we will be less likely to devote capital to exploration activities.\nGiven current and projected future commodity prices, we will continue to review our acreage position and future drilling plans. In addition, we will assess the carrying value of our properties relative to their estimated future net cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows from our properties are based on our aggregate best estimates of future production, commodity pricing, gathering and transportation deducts, production tax rates, lease operating expenses and future development costs as of the balance sheet date.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\"). DD&A increased to $321.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with $228.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $92.8 million was the result of a 23% increase in production and a 14% increase in the DD&A rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in production accounted for a $53.2 million increase in DD&A expense while the increase in the DD&A rate accounted for a $39.6 million increase in DD&A expense.\nUnder successful efforts accounting, depletion expense is calculated using the units-of-production method on the basis of some reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. The capital expenditures for proved properties for each field compared to the proved reserves corresponding to each producing field determine a depletion rate for current production. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the relationship of capital expenditures, proved reserves and production from certain producing fields yielded a depletion rate of $25.62 per Boe compared with $22.46 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the depletion rate of 14% is the result of year end 2018 reserve adjustments.\nUnused Commitments. Unused commitments expense of $17.7 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to gas transportation contracts. During March 2010, we entered into two firm natural gas pipeline transportation contracts to provide a guaranteed outlet for production from the West Tavaputs area of the Uinta Basin and the Gibson Gulch area of the Piceance Basin. These transportation contracts were not included in the sales of these assets in December 2013 and September 2014, respectively. Both firm transportation contracts require the pipeline to provide transportation capacity and require us to pay monthly transportation charges regardless of the amount of pipeline capacity utilized. The agreements expire July 31, 2021.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense decreased to $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. General and administrative expense on a per Boe basis decreased to $3.57 for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $4.44 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncluded in general and administrative expense is long-term cash and equity incentive compensation of $8.6 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The components of long-term cash and equity incentive compensation for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are shown in the following table:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonvested common stock\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonvested common stock units\n</td> <td>1,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonvested performance cash units (1)\n</td> <td>844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The nonvested performance cash units are accounted for as liability awards and will be settled in cash for the performance metrics that are met. The expense for the period will increase or decrease based on updated fair values of these awards at each reporting date. \nMerger Transaction Expense. Merger transaction expense was $4.5 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Transaction expenses included severance, consulting, advisory, legal and other merger-related fees that were not capitalized as part of the Merger.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility. See Note 5 for additional information.\nCommodity Derivative Gain (Loss). Commodity derivative loss was $99.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with a gain of $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The gain or loss on commodity derivatives is related to fluctuations of oil and natural gas future pricing compared to actual pricing of commodity hedges in place as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 or during the periods then ended.\nThe fair value of our open but not yet settled derivative contracts is based on an income approach using various assumptions, such as quoted forward prices for commodities, risk-free discount rates, volatility factors and time value factors. The mark-to-market fair value of the open commodity derivative contracts will generally be inversely related to the price movement of the underlying commodity. If commodity price trends reverse from period to period, prior unrealized gains may become unrealized losses and vice versa. Higher underlying commodity price volatility will generally lead to higher volatility in our unrealized gains and losses and, by association, the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts. These unrealized gains and losses will impact our net income in the period reported. The mark-to-market fair value can create non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility. We have experienced such volatility in the past and are likely to experience it in the future. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues.\nThe table below summarizes our commodity derivative gains and losses that were recognized in the periods presented:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gain (loss) on derivatives (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(47,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior year unrealized (gain) loss transferred to realized (gain) loss (1)\n</td> <td>(81,166\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives (1)\n</td> <td>(28,454\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commodity derivative gain (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98,953\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives are presented herein as separate line items but are combined for a total commodity derivative gain (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This separate presentation is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes the separate presentation of the realized and unrealized commodity derivative gains and losses is useful because the realized cash settlement portion provides a better understanding of our hedge position. We also believe that this disclosure allows for a more accurate comparison to our peers. \nIn 2019, approximately 88% of our oil volumes and 19% of our natural gas volumes were subject to financial hedges, which resulted in an increase in oil income of $11.7 million and a decrease in natural gas income of $1.0 million after settlements. In 2018, approximately 73% of our oil volumes and 14% of our natural gas volumes were covered by financial hedges, which resulted in a decrease in oil revenues of $47.7 million and an increase natural gas revenues of $0.1 million after settlements.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets. This determination was made by considering all available evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, assets acquired in connection with the Merger and their classification as proved or unproved, current and projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. In making this assessment, judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets. This determination was made by considering all available evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Such evidence included the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, assets acquired in connection with the Merger and their classification as proved or unproved, current and projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. In making this assessment, judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence.\nAs a result of the analysis conducted, we reversed the majority of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets and recorded income tax expense of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017\nA discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with December 31, 2017 can be found in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity since our formation have been net cash provided by operating activities, sales and other issuances of equity and debt securities, bank credit facilities, proceeds from sale-leasebacks, joint exploration agreements and sales of interests in properties. Our primary use of capital has been for the development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. As we pursue profitable reserves and production growth, we continually monitor the capital resources available to us to meet our future financial obligations, fund planned capital expenditure activities and ensure adequate liquidity. Our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources being available to us. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity available to us from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and under our Amended Credit Facility for our planned uses of capital over the next twelve months.\nThe Amended Credit Facility provides for a maximum credit amount of $1.5 billion, an initial elected commitment amount of $500.0 million, and an initial borrowing base of $500.0 million. On October 1, 2019, the commitment and borrowing base amounts were reaffirmed at $500.0 million. At December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $16.4 million and a $140.0 million balance outstanding under our Amended Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $32.8 million and no amounts outstanding under our Amended Credit Facility. Our effective borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2019 was reduced by $26.0 million to $334.0 million due to an outstanding irrevocable letter of credit related to a firm transportation agreement. The letter of credit will begin reducing ratably per month beginning April 1, 2020 until it expires on August 31, 2021.\nOn March 19, 2018, we completed the Merger with Fifth Creek. The Merger was effected through the issuance of 100 million shares of our common stock, with a fair value of $484.0 million on the date of closing, and the repayment of $53.9 million of Fifth Creek debt. See \"Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties - Business - Significant Business Developments - Merger with Fifth Creek Energy Operating Company, LLC\" for additional information.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $278.6 million, $231.4 million and $122.0 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The changes in net cash provided by operating activities are discussed above in \"Results of Operations\". The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2017 to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in production revenues.\nCommodity Hedging Activities\nOur operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which are the prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce. Prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. National and worldwide economic activity and political stability, weather, infrastructure capacity to reach markets, supply levels and other variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict.\nTo mitigate some of the potential negative impact on cash flow caused by changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, we have entered into financial commodity swap contracts to receive fixed prices for a portion of our production. At December 31, 2019, we had in place crude oil swaps covering portions of our 2020 and 2021 production.\nIn addition to financial contracts, we may at times enter into various physical commodity contracts for the sale of oil and natural gas that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions. These physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception and, therefore, are not subject to hedge or mark-to-market accounting. The financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in oil, gas and NGL production revenues at the time of settlement.\nAll derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchase and normal sales exception as mentioned above, are recorded at fair market value and are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities. All fair values are\nadjusted for non-performance risk. All changes in the derivative's fair value are recorded in earnings. These mark-to-market adjustments produce a degree of earnings volatility but have no cash flow impact relative to changes in market prices. Our cash flow is only impacted when the associated derivative instrument contract is settled by making a payment to or receiving a payment from the counterparty.\nThe following table includes all hedges entered into through February 4, 2020.\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nHedged\nVolumes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Quantity\nType\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nFixed Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Index\nPrice (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swap Contracts:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,857,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Bbls\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>WTI\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,912,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Bbls\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>WTI\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) WTI refers to West Texas Intermediate price as quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange. \nBy removing the price volatility from a portion of our oil revenue, we have mitigated, but not eliminated, the potential effects of changing prices on our operating cash flow for the relevant period. While mitigating negative effects of falling commodity prices, these derivative contracts also limit the benefits we would receive from increases in commodity prices.\nIt is our policy to enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that are lenders in the Amended Credit Facility, affiliates of lenders in the Amended Credit Facility or potential lenders in the Amended Credit Facility. Our derivative contracts are documented using an industry standard contract known as a Schedule to the Master Agreement and International Swaps and Derivative Association, Inc. (\"ISDA\") Master Agreement or other contracts. Typical terms for these contracts include credit support requirements, cross default provisions, termination events and set-off provisions. We are not required to provide any credit support to our counterparties other than cross collateralization with the properties securing the Amended Credit Facility. We have set-off provisions in our derivative contracts with lenders under our Amended Credit Facility which, in the event of a counterparty default, allow us to set-off amounts owed to the defaulting counterparty under the Amended Credit Facility or other obligations against monies owed to us under the derivative contracts. Where the counterparty is not a lender under the Amended Credit Facility, we may not be able to set-off amounts owed by us under the Amended Credit Facility, even if such counterparty is an affiliate of a lender under such facility.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures are summarized in the following tables for the periods indicated:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basin/Area\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DJ\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>355.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>508.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (1)(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>508.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions of proved and unproved properties and other real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drilling, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties\n</td> <td>319.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>448.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathering and compression facilities\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Geologic and geophysical costs\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture, fixtures and equipment\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (1)(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>508.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes exploration and abandonement expense, which are expensed under successful efforts accounting, of $5.9 million, $0.8 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n (2) Excludes $716.2 million related to the proved and unproved oil and gas properties and furniture, equipment and other assets acquired in the Merger for the year ended December 31, 2018. \nCapital expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties and other real estate were $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily related to acquisitions of proved and unproved properties in the DJ Basin. The decrease in drilling, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties to $319.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $448.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to a decrease in development drilling and completion activities within the DJ Basin. The increase in geologic and geophysical costs to $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 is related to activity in the Hereford field.\nCapital expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties and other real estate were $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily related to acquisitions of proved and unproved properties in the DJ Basin. The increase in drilling, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties to $448.9 million from $226.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to an increase in development drilling and completion activities within the DJ Basin, including drilling and completion activities associated with properties acquired in the Merger. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 exclude any amounts associated with the purchase price of the Merger.\nOur current estimated capital expenditure budget for 2020 is $200.0 million to $220.0 million. The budget includes facilities costs and excludes acquisitions. We may adjust capital expenditures as business conditions and operating results warrant. The amount, timing and allocation of capital expenditures is generally discretionary and within our control. If oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline to below acceptable levels or costs increase above acceptable levels, we could choose to defer a portion of our budgeted capital expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity. We would generally do this by prioritizing capital projects to first focus on those that we believe will have the highest expected financial returns and ability to generate near-term cash flow.\nWe believe that we have sufficient available liquidity with available cash on hand, cash under the Amended Credit Facility and cash flow from operations to fund our 2020 budgeted capital expenditures. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including our level of oil and natural gas production, commodity prices and operating costs. There can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide sufficient amounts of cash flow to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nMerger Financing. On March 19, 2018, we completed the Merger with Fifth Creek. The Merger was effected through the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of our common stock, with a fair value of $484.0 million, and the repayment of $53.9 million of Fifth Creek debt.\nAmended Credit Facility. We had $140.0 million and zero outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Amended Credit Facility provides for a maximum credit amount of $1.5 billion, an initial elected commitment amount of $500.0 million and an initial borrowing base of $500.0 million. On October 1, 2019, the commitment and borrowing base amounts were reaffirmed at $500.0 million. The current maturity date of the Amended Credit Facility is July 16, 2022. While the stated maturity date in the Amended Credit Facility is September 14, 2023,\nthe maturity date is accelerated if the Company has more than $100 million of \"Permitted Debt\" or \"Permitted Refinancing Debt\" (as those terms are defined in the Amended Credit Facility) that matures prior to December 14, 2023. If that is the case, the accelerated maturity date is 91 days prior to the earliest maturity of such Permitted Debt or Permitted Refinancing Debt. Because the Company's 7.0% Senior Notes will mature on October 15, 2022, the aggregate amount of those notes exceeds $100 million and the notes represent \"Permitted Debt\", the maturity date specified in the Amended Credit Facility is accelerated to the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of those notes, or July 16, 2022.\nBorrowing bases are computed based on proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, hedge positions and estimated future cash flows from those reserves calculated using future commodity pricing provided by our lenders, as well as any other outstanding debt. Lower commodity prices will generally result in a lower borrowing base.\nWe are in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2019 and have complied with all financial covenants since issuance. We expect to be in compliance with all financial covenants based on the 2020 budget at current commodity prices.\nOur outstanding debt is summarized below:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt Issuance Costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt Issuance Costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\nAmount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amended Credit Facility\n</td> <td>September 14, 2023\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.0% Senior Notes\n</td> <td>October 15, 2022\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,372\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8.75% Senior Notes\n</td> <td>June 15, 2025\n</td> <td>275,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,717\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,403\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease Financing Obligation\n</td> <td>August 10, 2020\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>765,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,089\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>758,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>626,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>619,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Current Portion of Long-Term Debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total Long-Term Debt (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>765,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,089\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>758,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>625,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>617,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) As of December 31, 2018, the current portion of long-term debt included the Lease Financing Obligation, which was settled on February 10, 2019. \n (2) See Note 5 for additional information. \nCredit Ratings. Our credit risk is evaluated by two independent rating agencies based on publicly available information and information obtained during our ongoing discussions with the rating agencies. Moody's Investor Services and Standard & Poor's Rating Services currently rate our 7.0% Senior Notes and 8.75% Senior Notes and have assigned a credit rating. We do not have any provisions that are linked to our credit ratings, nor do we have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of amounts due under our Amended Credit Facility, the 7.0% Senior Notes or the 8.75% Senior Notes. However, our ability to raise funds and the costs of any financing activities will be affected by our credit rating at the time any such financing activities are conducted.\nContractual Obligations.

This table does not include future commitment fees, interest expense or other fees on our Amended Credit Facility because the Amended Credit Facility is a floating rate instrument, and we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances, repayments or future interest rates to be charged. Also included in notes payable is interest on a $26.0 million letter of credit that accrues at 1.75% and 0.125% per annum for participation fees and fronting fees, respectively. The expected term for the letter of credit is January 31, 2020. \n (2) The aggregate principal amount of our 7.0% Senior Notes is $350.0 million. We are obligated to make semi-annual interest payments through maturity on October 15, 2022 equal to $12.3 million. See Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information. \n (3) On April 28, 2017, we issued $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes. We are obligated to make semi-annual interest payments through maturity on June 15, 2025 equal to $12.0 million. See Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information. \n (4) We have entered into contracts that provide firm transportation capacity on oil and gas pipeline systems. The contracts require us to pay transportation demand charges regardless of the amount we deliver to the processing facility or pipeline. \n (5) Includes a gas gathering and processing contract which requires us to deliver a minimum volume of natural gas to a midstream entity for gathering and processing on a monthly basis. The contract requires us to pay a fee associated with the contracted volumes regardless of the amount delivered. \n (6) Includes reimbursement obligations of $2.4 million. The reimbursement obligations require us to pay a monthly gathering and processing fee per Mcf of production to reimburse midstream entities for costs to construct gas gathering and processing facilities. If the costs are not reimbursed by us via the monthly gathering and processing fees, we must pay the difference. \n (7) Neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor the timing of our asset retirement obligations can be precisely determined in advance. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in estimating asset retirement obligations. \n (8) Derivative liability represents the net fair value for oil commodity derivatives presented as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019. The ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market fluctuations. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" in Part II, Item 7 and in \"Commodity Hedging Activities\" above for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in valuing derivative instruments. \n (9) Operating leases primarily includes office leases. Also included are leases of operations equipment which are shown as gross amounts that we are financially committed to pay. However, we will record in our financial statements our proportionate share based on our working interest, which will vary from property to property. \n (10) Primarily includes a fresh water commitment contract which requires us to purchase a minimum volume of fresh water from a supplier. The contract requires us to pay a fee associated with the contracted volumes regardless of the amount delivered. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nRegulatory Trends\nOur future Rockies operations and cost of doing business may be affected by changes in regulations and the ability to obtain drilling permits. The regulatory environment continues to become more restrictive, which limits our ability to, and increases the costs of, conducting our operations. Areas in which we operate are subject to federal, state and local regulations. Additional and more restrictive regulations have been seen at each of these governmental levels recently and there are initiatives underway to implement additional regulations and prohibitions on oil and gas activities. New rules may further impact our ability to obtain drilling permits and other required approvals in a timely manner and increase the costs of such permits or approvals. This may create substantial uncertainty about our production and capital expenditure targets. Efforts related to climate change organized around a \"keep it in the ground\" message have gained traction in New York and other coastal states, as well as internationally, notably in France and Germany. See \"Business and Properties-Operations-Environmental Matters and Regulation\" for a summary of certain environmental regulations that affect our business and related developments, including potential future regulatory developments.\nDeclining Commodity Prices. The severe decline in oil prices that occurred in 2014 and 2015 increased the volatility and amplitude of the other risks facing us as described in this report and had an impact on our business and financial condition. The significant decrease in oil prices in late 2018 and 2019 had a similar effect. If oil prices decrease from current levels, our planned drilling projects may become uneconomic, which could affect future drilling plans and growth rates. Low commodity prices impact our revenue, which we partially mitigate with our hedging program.\nThe sustained decline in commodity prices may also expose us to unexpected liability for plugging and abandoning wells, and associated reclamation, including for assets that were sold to other industry parties in prior years. If such third parties become unable to fulfill their contract obligations to us as provided for in purchase and sale agreements, regulatory agencies and landowners may demand that we perform such activities. Recent case law in Wyoming has increased such exposure for companies that have divested assets to no longer viable entities, and we have received demands from the Bureau of Land Management and a several large ranches to plug and abandon wells, and conduct associated reclamation, on properties we no longer own. We recognized $0.3 million and $1.9 million associated with these obligations in other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments below. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nOil and Gas Properties\nOur oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not find proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and remain within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. If an exploratory well does find proved reserves, the costs remain capitalized, are included within additions to oil and gas properties and remain within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether proved reserves are added or not. All exploratory wells are evaluated for economic viability within one year of well completion, and the related capitalized costs are reviewed quarterly. Exploratory wells that discover potentially economic reserves in areas where a major capital expenditure would be required before production could begin and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful\ncompletion of further exploratory work in the area remain capitalized if the well finds a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well, and we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated DD&A are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized. Interest cost is capitalized as a component of property cost for significant exploration and development projects that require greater than six months to be readied for their intended use.\nThe application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred. In addition to development on exploratory wells, we may drill scientific wells that are only used for data gathering purposes. The costs associated with these scientific wells are expensed as incurred as exploration expense. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze, and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience.\nOther exploration costs, including certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. The sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit-of-production amortization rate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts.\nUnproved oil and gas property costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties if the properties are subsequently determined to be productive or are assigned proved reserves. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without recognizing any gain until all costs are recovered. Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks, future plans to develop acreage, recent sales prices of comparable properties and other relevant matters.\nWe review our oil and natural gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. We estimate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our oil and gas properties using proved and risked probable and possible reserves based on our development plans and best estimate of future production, commodity pricing, reserve risking, gathering and transportation deductions, production tax rates, lease operating expenses and future development costs. We compare such undiscounted future net cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the undiscounted future net cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties, no impairment is taken. If the carrying amount of a property exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows, we will impair the carrying value to fair value based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors existing as of the balance sheet date. The factors used to determine fair value may include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, indications from marketing activities, the present value of future revenues, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the projected cash flows.\nOil and gas properties are assessed for impairment once they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying cost or fair value less costs to sell. The fair value of the assets is determined using a market approach, based on an estimated selling price, as evidenced by current marketing activities, if possible. If an estimated selling price is not available, we utilize the income valuation technique, which involves calculating the present value of future net cash flows, as discussed above. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value less costs to sell, an impairment will result to reduce the value of the properties down to fair value less costs to sell. The estimated fair value of assets held for sale may be materially different from sales proceeds that we eventually realize due to a number of factors including but not limited to the differences in expected future commodity pricing, location and quality differentials, our relative desire to dispose of such properties based on facts and circumstances impacting our business at the time we agree to sell, such as our position in the field subsequent to the sale and plans for future acquisitions or development in core areas.\nOur investment in producing oil and natural gas properties includes an estimate of the future costs associated with dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties. The present value of the estimated future costs to dismantle, abandon and restore a well location are added to the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties and recorded as a long-term liability. The capitalized cost is included in the oil and natural gas property costs that are depleted over the life of the assets.\nThe provision for depletion of oil and gas properties is calculated on a field-by-field basis using the units-of-production method. Natural gas and NGLs are converted to an oil equivalent, Boe, at the standard rate of six Mcf to one Boe and forty-two gallons to one Boe, respectively. Our rate of recording DD&A is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved\ndeveloped reserves, which incorporate assumptions regarding future development and abandonment costs as well as our level of capital spending. If the estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline, the rate at which we record DD&A expense increases, reducing our net income. This decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. We are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program, as well as future economic conditions.\nOil and Gas Reserve Quantities\nOur estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Our proved reserves estimates are audited on a well-by-well basis by an independent third party engineering firm. In the aggregate, the independent third party petroleum engineer estimates of total net proved reserves are within 10% of our internal estimates as of December 31, 2019.\nReserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations. As a result, adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserves estimates. We prepare our reserves estimates, and the projected cash flows derived from these reserves estimates, in accordance with SEC guidelines. Our independent third party engineering firm adheres to the same guidelines when auditing our reserve reports. The accuracy of our reserves estimates is a function of many factors including the following: the quality and quantity of available data, the interpretation of that data, the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the reserves estimates.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserves estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserves estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statements. As such, reserves estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of oil and natural gas eventually recovered.\nPlease refer to the reserve disclosures in \"Items 1 and 2 - Business and Properties\" for further detail on reserves data.\nRevenue Recognition\nAll of our sales of oil, gas and NGLs are made under contracts with customers, whereby revenues are recognized when we satisfy our performance obligations and the customer obtains control of the product. Performance obligations under our contracts with customers are typically satisfied at a point-in-time through monthly delivery of oil, gas and/or NGLs. Accordingly, at the end of the reporting period, we do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations. Our contracts with customers typically include variable consideration based on monthly pricing tied to local indices and volumes delivered in the current month. The nature of our contracts with customers do not require us to constrain variable consideration for accounting purposes. Our contracts with customers typically require payment within one month of"}
