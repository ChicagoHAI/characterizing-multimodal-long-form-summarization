MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this Form 10-K that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the relevant forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, growth opportunities and competitive positions, as well as the rapidly changing challenges with, and the Company's plans and responses to, the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic and related economic disruptions. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Risk Factors.\" The information in this Form 10-K should be evaluated in light of these important risk factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nThe risk factors discussed in \"Risk Factors\" could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. There may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Any such risks could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements.\nIntroduction and Objective\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") provides additional material information about the Company's business, recent developments and financial condition; its results of operations at a consolidated and segment level; its liquidity and capital resources including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources; and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect its financial statements. MD&A is organized as follows:\n\u2022Business Overview: This section provides a general description of the Company's business, as well as recent developments that management believes are important in understanding its results of operations and financial condition or in understanding anticipated future trends.\n\u2022Consolidated Results of Operations: This section provides an analysis of the Company's consolidated results of operations.\n\u2022Analysis of Operating Revenue and Profit by Segment: This section provides an analysis of the Company's results of operations by business segment.\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources: This section provides a discussion of the Company's liquidity, financial condition and an analysis of its cash flows, including a discussion of the Company's ability to fund its future commitments and ongoing operating activities in the short-term (i.e., over the next twelve months from the most recent fiscal period end) and in the long-term (i.e., beyond the next twelve months) through internal and external sources of capital. It includes an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources.\n\u2022Critical Accounting Estimates: This section identifies and summarizes the significant judgments or estimates on the part of management in preparing the Company's consolidated financial statements that may materially impact the Company's reported results of operations and financial condition.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAmounts in the MD&A are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million. Accordingly, a recalculation of totals and percentages, if based on the reported data, may be slightly different.\nBusiness Overview\nReportable segments\nThe Company operates three segments: Commercial Real Estate; Land Operations; and Materials & Construction. A description of each of the Company's reporting segments is as follows:\n\u2022Commercial Real Estate (\"CRE\") - This segment functions as a vertically integrated real estate investment company with core competencies in investments and acquisitions (i.e., identifying opportunities and acquiring properties); construction and development (i.e., designing and ground-up development of new properties or repositioning and redevelopment of existing properties); and in-house leasing and property management (i.e., executing new and renegotiating renewal lease arrangements, managing its properties' day-to-day operations and maintaining positive tenant relationships). The Company's preferred asset classes include improved properties in retail and industrial spaces and also urban ground leases. Its focus within improved retail properties, in particular, is on grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers that meet the daily needs of Hawai\u2018i citizens. Through its core competencies and with its experience and relationships in Hawai\u2018i, the Company seeks to create special places that enhance the lives of Hawai\u2018i residents and to provide venues and opportunities that enable its tenants to thrive. Income from this segment is principally generated by owning, operating and leasing real estate assets.\n\u2022Land Operations - This segment includes the Company's legacy assets and landholdings that are subject to the Company's simplification and monetization effort. Financial results from this segment are principally derived from real estate development and land sales, income/loss from real estate joint ventures, hydroelectric energy and other legacy business activities.\n\u2022Materials & Construction (\"M&C\") - This segment operates as Hawai\u2018i's largest asphalt paving contractor and is one of the state's largest natural materials and infrastructure construction companies. Such activities are primarily conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Grace Pacific LLC (\"Grace Pacific\"), a materials and construction company in Hawai\u2018i.\nSimplification strategy\nAs a result of its conversion to a REIT and consequent de-emphasis of non-REIT operating businesses, the Company has established a strategy to simplify its business, which includes ongoing efforts to accelerate the monetization of land and related assets and also includes evaluating strategic options for the eventual monetization of some or all of its Materials & Construction businesses.\nWhile the Company continues to evaluate options for the Grace Pacific paving business, during the second quarter of 2020, the Company consummated the sale of one of Grace Pacific's subsidiary operations, GP/RM Prestress, LLC (\"GPRM\"), a provider of precast/prestressed concrete products and services (which the Company historically consolidated through the disposal date due to holding a controlling financial interest through its majority voting interests). In connection with this sale and disposal, the Company recognized a write-down of $5.6 million (based on fair value less cost to sell) related to GPRM which was included in Impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of operations in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRelated to the Land Operations segment, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company executed a purchase and sale agreement and consummated the sale of assets related to its solar power facility in Port Allen on Kauai for purchase consideration (measured at the date of disposal) of approximately $17.1 million. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a gain on disposal of approximately $8.9 million which was included in Gain (loss) on disposal of non-core assets, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nMoreover, related to its unconsolidated equity method investments in joint venture development projects at Kukui\u2018ula, the Company continues its evaluation of opportunities to monetize these investments or, in conjunction with the joint venture partners, its evaluation of a range of alternative strategies to accelerate the monetization of the land in the joint venture projects. Any potential transaction related to either the investments or the assets within the joint venture projects would be dependent upon a number of external factors that may be beyond the Company's and/or joint venture projects' control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends and the interest of third parties in the Kukui\u2018ula development projects. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of the options evaluated will be pursued or completed. Further, there can be no assurance that the outcome of the evaluation of strategic alternatives or any potential transaction will result in the Company being able to maintain the carrying value of the Kukui\u2018ula joint venture development projects.\nCoronavirus outbreak\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the global economy and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. Considerable uncertainty surrounds COVID-19 and its effects on the population, as well as the effectiveness of any responses taken by government authorities. The pandemic resulted in a significant decline in Hawai\u2018i tourism and increase in business closures during the year ended December 31, 2020; it has significantly impacted the Company's business due largely to the extreme hardships facing its retail tenants. The ultimate extent of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources will largely depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, the severity of economic disruptions and resulting impact on economic growth/recession, the response by all levels of government in their efforts to contain the outbreak and to mitigate the economic disruptions, the impact on travel and tourism behavior and the impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted.\nAs of February 12, 2021, all of the Company's properties within its CRE portfolio remain open and substantially all of its existing tenants remain open and operating in some capacity. Further, as of this date, the CRE portfolio tenants have paid approximately 84% of their fourth quarter billings and 84% of their January 2021 lease billings (which includes base rents and recoveries from tenants). Within this population, the Company's grocer tenants (designated as essential businesses and located within its grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers), have paid approximately 93% of their fourth quarter billings and approximately 85% of their January 2021 lease billings.\nAs a result of COVID-19, certain tenants experiencing economic difficulties have sought and may continue to seek current and future rent relief, which may be provided in the form of rent deferrals or other relief modifications that result in changes to fixed contractual lease payments for specific months, among other possible arrangements.\nStarting in and during the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, rent assistance provided to certain tenants primarily consisted of rent deferrals which varied in terms of months covered and the repayment period (e.g., on a short-term basis to be repaid over the second half of 2020 or on a long-term basis to be repaid over 2021). Subsequent to June 30, 2020 and during the remainder of the year ended December 31, 2020, rent assistance arrangements involved additional deferrals as well as other relief modifications, including modifying the nature of rent payments from fixed to variable (i.e., variable based on a percentage of the tenant's sales, typically subject to a minimum \"floor\" amount) or, in some cases, payment forgiveness.\nAs of December 31, 2020, rent assistance arrangements offered and agreed to with tenants as a result of COVID-19 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Number of tenants </td> <td> </td> <td>Total impacted lease billings </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent deferrals </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other relief modifications1\n</td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 Certain tenants that were provided other relief modifications may have also been subject to rent deferrals.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company estimated a higher amount of uncollectable tenant billings due to COVID-19, pursuant to which the reductions in revenue the Company recorded as a result of such assessments were as follows (in millions):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact to billed accounts receivable </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact to straight-line lease receivables </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue reductions - tenant collectability assessments </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for allowance for doubtful accounts1\n</td> <td>3.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue reductions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 Related to other impacted operating lease receivables.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in reductions in operating profit and its non-GAAP performance measures. As such, the comparability of\nthe Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 to future periods may be significantly impacted by the effects of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries should be read in

ended December 31, 2019 are described below or in the Analysis of Operating Revenue and Profit by Segment sections below.\nOperating revenue for 2020 decreased 29.8%, or $129.9 million, to $305.3 million due primarily to lower revenue from the Land Operations segment and Materials & Construction segment.\nCost of operations for 2020 decreased 31.5%, or $107.4 million, to $233.5 million, due primarily to lower costs from the Land Operations segment and Materials & Construction segment.\nSelling, general and administrative for 2020 decreased 21.7%, or $12.8 million, to $46.1 million primarily due to lower corporate overhead costs, as well as lower costs incurred in the Materials & Construction and CRE segments. Corporate overhead costs decreased from the prior period primarily due to lower personnel-related costs.\nImpairment of assets for 2020 related to the sale and disposal of GPRM at the close of the quarter ended June 30, 2020. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company recorded impairments of $49.7 million related to goodwill and long-lived assets for the quarry & paving operations in its Materials & Construction segment.\nGain (loss) on disposal of assets, net was $9.6 million in 2020, primarily driven by the consummation of the sale of assets related to the Company's solar power facility in Port Allen on

2019. Operating profit decreased 24.8%, or $16.4 million, to $49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in each of Commercial Real Estate operating revenue and operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects revenue charges of $19.0 million related to the collectability of tenant billings that the Company recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, as well as the impact of other relief modifications (e.g., rent forgiveness) and other adjustments provided in the period of $6.4 million (described above). Such decreases in revenue and operating profit were partially offset by the positive impacts to revenue and operating profit of properties acquired in the first half of 2019 and redevelopment/new development projects commencing operations (which was also the primary driver of an increase in operating costs and expenses of 7.4% or $6.6 million to $95.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020). Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.6 million from the prior year primarily driven by lower personnel cost.\nCommercial Real Estate interest and other income (expense), net from the prior year was primarily driven by interest income earned on \u00a71031 exchange funds from the sale of agricultural land on Maui in 2018 (which were utilized as of the end of the quarter ended June 30, 2019).\nCommercial Real Estate portfolio acquisitions and dispositions\nThere were no acquisitions of CRE improved properties or ground lease interest in land during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made the following disposition within one of its commercial real estate properties under a purchase option held and executed by the then-current tenant as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dispositions </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property </td> <td> </td> <td>Location </td> <td> </td> <td>Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Purchase Price </td> <td> </td> <td>GLA (SF) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Collection (Suites 2 & 3) </td> <td> </td> <td>Oahu, HI </td> <td> </td> <td>2/20 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,100 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeasing activity\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company signed 68 new leases and 152 renewal leases for its improved properties across its three asset classes, covering 919,425 square feet of GLA. The 68 new leases consist of 141,675 square feet with an average annual base rent of $22.82 per-square-foot. Of the 68 new leases, 13 leases with a total GLA of 13,817 square feet were considered comparable (i.e., leases executed for units that have been vacated in the previous 12 months for comparable space and comparable lease terms) and, for these 13 leases, resulted in a 3.1% average base rent decrease over comparable expiring leases. The 152 renewal leases consist of 777,750 square feet with an average annual base rent of $24.77 per square foot. Of the 152 renewal leases, 89 leases with a total GLA of 575,539 were considered comparable and resulted in a 7.7% average base rent increase over comparable expiring leases.\nLeasing activity summarized by asset class for the year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Leases </td> <td>GLA </td> <td>ABR/SF </td> <td>Rent Spread1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail </td> <td>141 </td> <td>610,903 </td> <td>$28.76 </td> <td>6.9% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial </td> <td>64 </td> <td>276,692 </td> <td>$14.23 </td> <td>10.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office </td> <td>15 </td> <td>31,830 </td> <td>$31.33 </td> <td>1.7% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Rent spread is calculated for comparable leases, a subset of the total population of leases for the period presented (described above).\nOccupancy\nOccupancy represents the percentage of square footage leased and commenced to gross leasable space at the end of the period reported. The Company's commercial portfolio occupancy - and occupancy metrics for a category of properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of the prior calendar year and current period, to date (\"Same-Store\" as more fully described below) - summarized by asset class as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Point Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail </td> <td> </td> <td>91.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>93.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.1) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>98.6% </td> <td> </td> <td>95.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office </td> <td> </td> <td>91.6% </td> <td> </td> <td>90.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Improved Portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>93.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>93.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-Store Occupancy </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Point Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail </td> <td> </td> <td>93.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>95.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>98.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>94.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office </td> <td> </td> <td>91.6% </td> <td> </td> <td>90.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Improved Portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>95.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>94.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLand Operations\nTrends, events and uncertainties\nThe asset class mix of real estate sales in any given period can be diverse and may include developed residential real estate, developable subdivision lots, undeveloped land or property sold under threat of condemnation. Further, the timing of property or parcel sales can significantly affect operating results in a given period.\nAdditionally, the operating profit reported in each period does not necessarily follow a percentage of sales trend because the cost basis of property sold can differ significantly between transactions. For example, the sale of undeveloped land and vacant parcels in Hawai\u2018i may result in higher margins than the sale of developed property due to the low historical cost basis of the Company's land owned in Hawai\u2018i.\nAs a result, direct year-over-year comparison of the Land Operations segment results may not provide a consistent, measurable indicator of future performance. Further, Land Operations revenue trends, cash flows from the sales of real estate, and the amount of real estate held for sale on the Company's consolidated balance sheet do not necessarily indicate future profitability trends for this segment.\nFinancial results\nResults of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in millions; unaudited) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development sales revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unimproved/other property sales revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating revenue1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Land Operations operating revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>40.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land Operations operating costs and expenses2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(31.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on disposal of assets, net </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings (loss) from joint ventures </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income (expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Land Operations operating profit (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 Other operating revenue includes revenue related to trucking, renewable energy and diversified agriculture.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 Includes intersegment operating charges primarily from CRE that are eliminated in the consolidated results of operations.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2020: Land Operations revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $40.6 million and included the sales of development parcels at Maui Business Park II and unimproved land sales on the island of Kauai and Maui. Revenue also included other operating revenue related to the Company's legacy business activities in the Land Operations segment (e.g., trucking service, renewable energy, and diversified agribusiness operations).\nLand Operations operating profit of $17.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by the gain of $8.9 million realized on the sale of the Company's solar power facility in Port Allen during the third quarter and was also composed of the margins on the sales noted above, as well as profits generated from the operations of the segment's other legacy business activities. Other notable items within operating profit during the year ended December 31, 2020 included a charge of $6.7 million related to the estimated costs of probable remediation work for reservoirs on Kauai, as well as the impact of a favorable resolution of certain contingent liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the sale of agricultural land on Maui in 2018.\n2019: Land Operations revenue of $114.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by development sales activity which included three of the remaining Kahala Avenue acres; 44 of the remaining units for the Company's Kamalani project in Kihei, Maui; nine acres at Maui Business Park (Phase II); unimproved/other property sales activity related to the sale of land and related property and rights in Wailea, Maui; and the sale of unimproved property of approximately 800 acres of agricultural land on Maui.\nMaterials & Construction\nFinancial results\nResults of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions, tons delivered in thousands;

Backlog primarily consists of asphalt paving and, to a lesser extent, Grace Pacific's consolidated revenue from its construction-and traffic control-related products. Backlog includes estimated revenue from the remaining portion of contracts not yet completed, as well as revenue from approved change orders. The length of time that projects remain in backlog can span from a few days for a small volume of work to 36 months for large paving contracts and contracts performed in phases. This amount includes opportunity backlog consisting of government contracts in which Grace Pacific has been confirmed to be the lowest bidder and formal communication of the award is perfunctory at the time of this disclosure (such amounts were $64.1 million and $7.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively). Circumstances outside the Company's control such as procurement or technical protests may arise that prevent the finalization of such contracts. Maui Paving's backlog as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $5.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively.\nMaterials & Construction revenue was $114.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $160.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating loss was $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the segment operating loss was largely driven by a write-down of $5.6 million related to the sale of the Company's interest in GPRM which was completed during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the segment operating loss of $69.2 million was primarily driven by the $49.7 million non-cash impairment to the carrying value of the Company's goodwill balance.\nThe remaining operating loss during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due primarily to the impact of low paving volumes resulting from government agency-imposed project delays and the impact of COVID-19 (including travel restrictions and resource availability for projects on neighbor islands) during the second quarter as well as the fourth quarter; these losses were only partially offset by the operating profit generated in the third quarter (primarily driven by improved volume and resulting financial performance from Grace paving and quarry operations). The Company is continuing to monitor the performance of the M&C segment in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, based on the inherent uncertainty in the general economic environment, there can be no assurance that the carrying values associated with the long-lived assets and goodwill will be recoverable and impairments on such long-lived assets and goodwill may be required.\nBacklog at December 31, 2020 was $126.7 million (as a result of the disposal of GPRM at the end of the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, this metric excludes backlog related to GPRM). On a comparable basis (i.e., adjusted to exclude GPRM backlog of $20.8 million as of December 31, 2019), backlog increased from $58.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase in backlog was primarily driven by an increase in the amount of marketed bid opportunities and an improvement in the rate of bids won by the Company.\nRelated to the calculation of the backlog metric, as noted in prior periods, certain agencies award \"maintenance contracts\" under which a contractor can secure all paving work within a certain geographic area, but jobs are not identified in\nadvance (and, therefore, will not meet the requirement for inclusion in backlog). Under this maintenance contract system, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also secured significant maintenance contract awards, including the Oahu State Pavement Preservation maintenance contracts for the entire island of Oahu. Procedurally, the Company must receive specific work orders that would meet the definition of backlog and provide actionable scopes of work, including quantities, location, materials and project economics.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because management believes that they provide additional insight into the Company's and segments' core operating results, and/or the underlying business trends affecting performance on a consistent and comparable basis from period to period. These measures generally are provided to investors as an additional means of evaluating the performance of ongoing core operations. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nFFO is presented by the Company as a widely used non-GAAP measure of operating performance for real estate companies. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\") December 2018 Financial Standards White Paper as follows: net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding (1) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (2) gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, (3) gains and losses from change in control and (4) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity.\nThe Company believes that, subject to the following limitations, FFO provides a supplemental measure to net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) for comparing its performance and operations to those of other REITs. FFO does not represent an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of the Company's liquidity. The Company presents different forms of FFO:\n\u2022\"Core FFO\" represents a non-GAAP measure relevant to the operating performance of the Company's commercial real estate business (i.e., its core business). Core FFO is calculated by adjusting CRE operating profit to exclude items noted above (i.e., depreciation and amortization related to real estate included in CRE operating profit) and to make further adjustments to include expenses not included in CRE operating profit but that are necessary to accurately reflect the operating performance of its core business (i.e., corporate expenses and interest expense attributable to this core business). The Company believes such adjustments facilitate the comparable measurement of the Company's core operating performance over time. The Company believes that Core FFO, which is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, provides an additional and useful means to assess and compare the operating performance of REITs.\n\u2022FFO represents the Nareit-defined non-GAAP measure for the operating performance of the Company as a whole. The Company's calculation refers to net income (loss) available to A&B common shareholders as its starting point in the calculation of FFO.\nThe Company presents both non-GAAP measures and reconciles each to the most directly-comparable GAAP measure as well as reconciling FFO to Core FFO. The Company's FFO and Core FFO may not be comparable to FFO non-GAAP measures reported by other REITs. These other REITs may not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or may interpret the current Nareit definition differently.\nNOI is a non-GAAP measure used internally in evaluating the unlevered performance of the Company's Commercial Real Estate portfolio. The Company believes NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only the contractual income and cash-based expense items that are incurred at the property level. When compared across periods, NOI can be used to determine trends in earnings of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by non-contractual revenue (e.g., straight-line lease adjustments required under GAAP); by non-cash expense recognition items (e.g., the impact of depreciation and amortization expense or impairments); or by other expenses or gains or losses that do not directly relate to the Company's ownership and operations of the properties (e.g., indirect selling, general, administrative and other expenses, as well as lease termination income). The Company believes the exclusion of these items from operating profit (loss) is useful because the resulting measure captures the contractually-based revenue that is realizable (i.e., assuming collectability is deemed probable) and the direct property-related expenses paid or payable in cash that are incurred in operating the Company's Commercial Real Estate portfolio, as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. NOI should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nNOI represents total Commercial Real Estate contractually-based operating revenue that is realizable (i.e., assuming collectability is deemed probable) less the direct property-related operating expenses paid or payable in cash. The calculation of NOI excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization (e.g., depreciation related to capitalized costs for improved properties, other capital expenditures for building/area improvements and tenant space improvements, as well as amortization of leasing commissions); straight-line lease adjustments (including amortization of lease incentives); amortization of favorable/unfavorable lease assets/liabilities; lease termination income; interest and other income (expense), net; selling, general, administrative and other expenses (not directly associated with the property); and impairment of commercial real estate assets.\nThe Company reports NOI and Occupancy on a Same-Store basis, which includes the results of properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of the prior calendar year and current reporting period, year-to-date. The Same-Store pool excludes properties under development or redevelopment and also excludes properties acquired or sold during either of the comparable reporting periods. While there is management judgment involved in classifications, new developments and redevelopments are moved into the Same-Store pool after one full calendar year of stabilized operation. Properties included in held for sale are excluded from Same-Store.\nThe Company believes that reporting on a Same-Store basis provides investors with additional information regarding the operating performance of comparable assets separate from other factors (such as the effect of developments, redevelopments, acquisitions or dispositions).\nTo emphasize, the Company's methods of calculating non-GAAP measures may differ from methods employed by other companies and thus may not be comparable to such other companies.\nReconciliations of net income (loss) available to A&B common shareholders

business requirements and plans both in the short-term (i.e., the next twelve months from December 31, 2020) and long-term (i.e., beyond the next twelve months) have generally been cash provided by operating activities; available cash and cash equivalents; and borrowing capacity under its various credit facilities. The Company's primary liquidity needs for its business requirements and plans have generally been supporting its known contractual obligations and also funding capital expenditures (including recent commercial real estate acquisitions and real estate developments); shareholder distributions; and working capital needs.\nAs noted above, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted global commercial activity; has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets; and both its near-term and long-term economic impacts remain uncertain. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company proactively drew $120 million on its credit facility at the end of the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 to ensure it had ample access to capital and to increase flexibility; subsequently, the Company paid down such amounts throughout the year, in part, with proceeds from asset monetization efforts on transactions closed during the year. Additionally, the Company announced in the second quarter ended June 30, 2020 that it had temporarily suspended quarterly dividend distributions as it monitored its financial performance and economic outlook each quarter. Prior to December 31, 2020, the Company declared a dividend of $0.15 per share (to ensure it would maintain compliance with REIT taxable income distribution requirements for the full year).\nKnown contractual obligations\nA description of material contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020 is included in Note 10, Note 15 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, and relates to the Company's Notes payable and other debt, Operating lease liabilities and Accrued pension and post-retirement benefits, respectively, and is herein incorporated by reference.\nIn addition, contractual interest payments for Notes payable and other debt in the short term (i.e., over the next twelve months from December 31, 2020) and long-term (i.e., beyond the next twelve months) is estimated to be $26.8 million and $89.8 million, respectively (includes amounts based on contractual/fixed swap interest rates applied to future principal balances based on repayment schedules for secured and unsecured debt and also estimated interest on revolving credit facilities based on outstanding balances and the rate in effect as of December 31, 2020).\nTotal amounts to be spent on contractual non-cancellable purchase obligations (that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction that are not recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet) over the next twelve months from December 31, 2020 is $31.1 million; such amounts beyond the next twelve months are not material. The largest of such amounts pertain to the Company's CRE redevelopment project related to Aikahi Park Shopping Center (with a target in-service date at the end of 2021) totaling approximately $10.4 million to be spent over the next twelve months.\nA description of other commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020 is included in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, and is herein incorporated by reference.\nSources of liquidity\nAs noted above, one of the Company's principal sources of liquidity has been cash flows provided by operations, which were $63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven in the current year by cash generated from the CRE segment (the Company's core business). Total cash flows provided by operations decreased from the prior year ($157.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019), primarily driven by lower operating cash flows from the Land Operations segment due to the Company successfully completing sales on the remaining inventory for (and closing out of) two development-for-sale projects in 2019 (resulting in a lower volume in the current period of comparable development-for-sale project proceeds) as part of the Company's continued execution on its simplification strategy.\nThe Company's operating income (loss) and cash flows provided by operating activities is generated by its subsidiaries. There are no material restrictions on the ability of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to the Company.\nThe Company's other primary sources of liquidity include its cash and cash equivalents of $57.2 million as of December 31, 2020, and the Company's revolving credit and term facilities, which provide liquidity and flexibility on a short-term (i.e., the next twelve months from December 31, 2020), as well as long-term basis. With respect to the revolving credit facility for general A&B purposes, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had $111.0 million of borrowings outstanding, $1.1 million letters of credit issued against and $337.9 million of available capacity on such revolving credit facility (which currently has a term through September 15, 2022). Further, other sources of liquidity for the Company include trade receivables, contracts retention, and inventories (excluding parts, materials and supplies), totaling $60.9 million at December 31, 2020.\nOther uses (or sources) of liquidity\nThe Company may use (or, in some periods, generate) cash through various investing activities or financing activities. Cash provided by investing activities was $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $240.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The year ended December 31, 2020 included cash proceeds from the disposal of assets of $27.1 million (which was primarily driven by the consummation of non-core asset disposals related to the Company's solar power facility in Port Allen on Kauai and also its former GPRM subsidiary described above).\nCash used in investing activities is primarily composed of capital expenditures. In the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company had capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $25.1 million. As it relates to the CRE segment (i.e., its core business), the Company differentiates capital expenditures as follows (based on management's perspective on discretionary versus non-discretionary areas of spending for its CRE business):\n\u2022Growth Capital Expenditures: Property acquisition, development and redevelopment activity to generate income and cash flow growth.\n\u2022Maintenance Capital Expenditures: Activity necessary to maintain building value, the current income stream and position in the market.\nCapital expenditures for the respective periods for all segments were as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, unaudited) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CRE property acquisitions, development and redevelopment </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(95.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building/area improvements (Maintenance Capital Expenditures) </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant space improvements (Maintenance Capital Expenditures) </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarrying and paving </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136.8% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agribusiness and other </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33.3)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\u00b9 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>255.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90.2)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Excludes capital expenditures for real estate developments to be held and sold as real estate development inventory, which are classified in the consolidated statement of cash flows as operating activities and are excluded from the tables above.\nThe year ended December 31, 2019 included cash outlays of $255.1 million related to capital expenditures which was largely driven by $218.4 million related to the Company's acquisition of five commercial real estate assets using proceeds from the sale of legacy landholdings that qualified for tax-deferral treatment under \u00a71031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). There were no such acquisitions of commercial real estate assets in the current year ended December 31, 2020. See below for further discussion on the Company's use of \u00a71031 of the Code.\nThe Company regularly evaluates investment opportunities, including development-for-hold projects, commercial real estate acquisitions, joint venture investments, share repurchases, business acquisitions and other strategic transactions to increase shareholder value. The Company cannot predict whether or when it may make investments or what impact any such transactions could have on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Given the uncertainty around the duration and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is not able to project capital expenditures in 2021 related to any of its segments. However, the Company anticipates activity related to property acquisitions, development and redevelopment will be relatively consistent with the current year, and the Company expects building/area improvements and tenant space improvements to be consistent with or lower than current year expenditures.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities was $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $136.7 million. The change in cash flows from financing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was due primarily to lower net payments on debt (i.e., debt payments net of additional borrowings) of $18.7 million in year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $78.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as lower cash dividends paid of $13.8 million in year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $50.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther capital resource matters\nThe Company frequently utilizes \u00a71031 or \u00a71033 of the Code, to obtain tax-deferral treatment when qualifying real estate assets are sold or become subject to involuntary conversion and the resulting proceeds are reinvested in replacement properties within the required time period. Proceeds from potential tax-deferred sales under \u00a71031 of the Code are held in escrow (and presented as part of Restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets) pending future reinvestment or are returned to the Company for general use if eligibility for tax-deferral treatment based on the required time period lapses. The proceeds from involuntary conversions under \u00a71033 of the Code are held by the Company until the funds are redeployed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not complete any transactions that would give rise to cash proceeds from sales or involuntary conversion activity that qualified under \u00a71031 or \u00a71033 of the Code. Further, during the year ended December 31, 2020, there were no acquisitions utilizing eligible/available proceeds from tax-deferred sales or involuntary conversions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there are no amounts from tax-deferred sales that are available for use and have not been reinvested under \u00a71031 of the Code. As of December 31, 2020, the Company holds approximately $14.3 million from tax-deferred involuntary conversions that had not yet been reinvested under \u00a71033 of the Code.\nTrends, events and uncertainties\nAs noted above, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the global economy; has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets; and both its near-term and long-term economic impacts remain uncertain. This uncertainty includes the potential need for additional capital resources to maintain the Company's business and operations during a period of potential declining or delayed rent payments from CRE tenants and/or potential declining revenue from its other businesses.\nThe Company's ability to retain outstanding borrowings and utilize remaining amounts available under its revolving credit facility will depend on its continued compliance with the applicable financial covenants and other terms of the Company's notes payable and other debt arrangements. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants for all outstanding balances as of December 31, 2020. However, as a result of the various uncertainties and factors surrounding COVID-19, the Company may be unable to continue to maintain compliance with certain of its financial covenants. Failure to maintain compliance with its financial covenants or obtain waivers or agree to modifications with its lenders would have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition. The Company intends to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on its business and intends to operate in compliance with these covenants or seek to obtain waivers or modifications to these financial covenants to enable the Company to maintain compliance.\nBased on its current outlook, the Company believes that funds generated from cash provided by operating activities; available cash and cash equivalent balances; and borrowing capacity under its various credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the needs of the Company's business requirements and plans both in the short-term (i.e., the next twelve months from December 31, 2020) and long-term (i.e., beyond the next twelve months). There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that it will be able to maintain its ability to borrow under its available credit facilities. As the circumstances underlying its current outlook may change, the Company will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that it determines is in the best interest of its business, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, upon which the MD&A is based, requires that management exercise judgment when making estimates and assumptions about future events that may affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and actual results may differ from those critical accounting estimates. These differences could be material.\nManagement considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i)(a) the accounting estimate requires the Company to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate was made, (b) changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur in periods subsequent to the period in which the estimate was made, or (c) different estimates by the Company could have been used, and (ii) changes in those assumptions or estimates would have had a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. The critical accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company's financial statements are described below.\nImpairment of long-lived assets held and used and finite-lived intangible assets\nLong-lived assets held and used, including finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In such an evaluation, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset are compared with the amount recorded for the asset to determine if its carrying value is not recoverable. If this review determines that the recorded value will not be recovered, the amount recorded for the asset is reduced to estimated fair value. These asset impairment analyses are highly subjective because they require management to make assumptions and apply considerable judgments to, among other things, estimates of the timing and amount of future cash flows, expected useful lives of the assets, uncertainty about future events, including changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance, changes in the use of the assets and ongoing costs of maintenance and improvements of the assets, and thus, the accounting estimates may change from period to period. If management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, the Company's financial condition or its future financial results could be materially impacted.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded cumulative long-lived asset and finite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $40.6 million related to its Materials and Construction segment.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, the Company did not recognize any impairments of long-lived assets or finite-lived intangible assets for assets held and used.\nImpairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates\nThe Company's investments in unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment whenever there is evidence that fair value may be below carrying cost. An investment is written down to fair value if fair value is below carrying cost and the impairment is believed to be other-than-temporary. In evaluating the fair value of an investment and whether any identified impairment is other-than-temporary, significant estimates and considerable judgments are involved. These estimates and judgments are based, in part, on the Company's current and future evaluation of economic conditions in general, as well as a joint venture's current and future plans. Additionally, these impairment calculations are highly subjective because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgments to estimates regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows that may consider various factors, including sales prices, development costs, market conditions and absorption rates, probabilities related to various cash flow scenarios, and appropriate discount rates based on the perceived risks, among others. In evaluating whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers all available information, including but not limited to the financial condition and near-term prospects of the affiliate, the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, and projected industry and economic trends, among others. Changes in these and other assumptions could affect the projected operational results and fair value of the unconsolidated affiliates, and accordingly, may require valuation adjustments to the Company's investments that may materially impact the Company's financial condition or its future operating results.\nEconomic conditions in particular real estate markets, difficulty in obtaining or renewing project-level financing or development approvals, and changes in the Company's development strategy, among other factors, may affect the value or feasibility of certain development projects owned by the Company or by its joint ventures and could lead to additional impairment charges in the future.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company determined that its investment in Kukui\u2018ula was other-than-temporarily impaired due to the Company changing its strategy and no longer intending to hold its investment through the duration of the project. As a result, the Company estimated the fair value of its investment in Kukui\u2018ula using a discounted cash flow model and recorded a non-cash, other-than-temporary impairment of $186.8 million.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, the Company did not recognize any impairments of its investments in affiliates.\nGoodwill\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. If the results of the Company's test indicates that a reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe goodwill impairment test may involve estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit using various methodologies, including an income approach that is based on a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach that involves the application of market-derived multiples. When required, valuations may be performed in conjunction with the Company's goodwill impairment tests for each reporting unit which assumes that each is an unrelated business to be sold separately and independently from the other reporting units.\nThe discounted cash flow approach relies on a number of assumptions, including future macroeconomic conditions, market factors specific to the reporting unit, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time and a discount rate that considers the risks related to the amount and timing of the cash flows, among others. Under the market multiple methodology, the estimate of fair value is based on market multiples of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) or revenues. When using market multiples of EBITDA or revenues, the Company must make judgments about the comparability of those multiples in closed and proposed transactions and comparability of multiples for similar companies.\nThe Company's historical goodwill was attributable to (1) the three reporting units in the M&C segment - GPC (primarily consisting of the Grace Pacific's quarry, paving, and liquid asphalt operations), GPRS (primarily consisting of Grace Pacific's roadway and maintenance solutions operations) and GPRM (primarily consisting of Grace Pacific's prestressed and precast concrete operations until its disposal during the second quarter of 2020) - recognized in the acquisition of Grace Pacific in 2013 and (2) the CRE reporting unit, which is also the reportable segment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, based on the results of the valuation performed in conjunction with the Company's annual goodwill impairment test in 2018, the carrying amounts of the GPC and GPRS reporting units exceeded their estimated fair values and goodwill was determined to be impaired. The decline in fair value was due primarily to persisting, competitive market pressures that negatively affected sales and margins. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $37.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2018. The weighted-average discount rate used in the valuation was 13.6%. The GPRM reporting unit goodwill was not deemed to be impaired as GPRM's carrying amount exceeded its fair value by approximately 33 percent.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2019, the Company was required to perform an interim impairment test for the goodwill in each of its three M&C reporting units due to the continued decline in M&C sales and margins in 2019, which resulted from continued, adverse market conditions. Based on the results of the valuation performed in conjunction with this test, the carrying amounts of the three M&C reporting units exceeded their estimated fair values and goodwill was determined to be impaired. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $49.7 million during the third quarter of 2019. The weighted-average discount rate used in the discounted cash flow approach of the valuation was 12.7%.\nOther than those noted above, the Company did not record any additional impairments to the goodwill in its reporting units for the remainder of the year ended December 31, 2019 or in the year ended December 31, 2020. Subsequent to such impairments and the derecognition of the goodwill associated with the GPRM reporting unit as part of the disposal of GPRM noted above, as of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any material goodwill at any of its reporting units that were at risk (see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report).\nNew Accounting

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, growth opportunities and competitive positions, as well as the rapidly changing challenges with, and the Company's plans and responses to, the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic and related economic disruptions. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Risk Factors.\" The information in this Form 10-K should be evaluated in light of these important risk factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nThe risk factors discussed in \"Risk Factors\" could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. There may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Any such risks could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements.\nIntroduction and Objective\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") provides additional material information about the Company's business, recent developments and financial condition; its results of operations at a consolidated and segment level; its liquidity and capital resources including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources; and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect its financial statements. MD&A is organized as follows:\n\u2022Business Overview: This section provides a general description of the Company's business, as well as recent developments that management believes are important in understanding its results of operations and financial condition or in understanding anticipated future trends.\n\u2022Consolidated Results of Operations: This section provides an analysis of the Company's consolidated results of operations.\n\u2022Analysis of Operating Revenue and Profit by Segment: This section provides an analysis of the Company's results of operations by business segment.\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources: This section provides a discussion of the Company's liquidity, financial condition and an analysis of its cash flows, including a discussion of the Company's ability to fund its future commitments and ongoing operating activities in the short-term (i.e., over the next twelve months from the most recent fiscal period end) and in the long-term (i.e., beyond the next twelve months) through internal and external sources of capital. It includes an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources.\n\u2022Critical Accounting Estimates: This section identifies and summarizes the significant judgments or estimates on the part of management in preparing the Company's consolidated financial statements that may materially impact the Company's reported results of operations and financial condition.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAmounts in the MD&A are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million. Accordingly, a recalculation of totals and percentages, if based on the reported data, may be slightly different.\nBusiness Overview\nReportable segments\nThe Company operates three segments: Commercial Real Estate; Land Operations; and Materials & Construction. A description of each of the Company's reporting segments is as follows:\n\u2022Commercial Real Estate (\"CRE\") - This segment functions as a vertically integrated real estate investment company with core competencies in investments and acquisitions (i.e., identifying opportunities and acquiring properties); construction and development (i.e., designing and ground-up development of new properties or repositioning and redevelopment of existing properties); and in-house leasing and property management (i.e., executing new and renegotiating renewal lease arrangements, managing its properties' day-to-day operations and maintaining positive tenant relationships). The Company's preferred asset classes include improved properties in retail and industrial spaces and also urban ground leases. Its focus within improved retail properties, in particular, is on grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers that meet the daily needs of Hawai\u2018i citizens. Through its core competencies and with its experience and relationships in Hawai\u2018i, the Company seeks to create special places that enhance the lives of Hawai\u2018i residents and to provide venues and opportunities that enable its tenants to thrive. Income from this segment is principally generated by owning, operating and leasing real estate assets.\n\u2022Land Operations - This segment includes the Company's legacy assets and landholdings that are subject to the Company's simplification and monetization effort. Financial results from this segment are principally derived from real estate development and land sales, income/loss from real estate joint ventures, hydroelectric energy and other legacy business activities.\n\u2022Materials & Construction (\"M&C\") - This segment operates as Hawai\u2018i's largest asphalt paving contractor and is one of the state's largest natural materials and infrastructure construction companies. Such activities are primarily conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Grace Pacific LLC (\"Grace Pacific\"), a materials and construction company in Hawai\u2018i.\nSimplification strategy\nAs a result of its conversion to a REIT and consequent de-emphasis of non-REIT operating businesses, the Company has established a strategy to simplify its business, which includes ongoing efforts to accelerate the monetization of land and related assets and also includes evaluating strategic options for the eventual monetization of some or all of its Materials & Construction businesses.\nWhile the Company continues to evaluate options for the Grace Pacific paving business, during the second quarter of 2020, the Company consummated the sale of one of Grace Pacific's subsidiary operations, GP/RM Prestress, LLC (\"GPRM\"), a provider of precast/prestressed concrete products and services (which the Company historically consolidated through the disposal date due to holding a controlling financial interest through its majority voting interests). In connection with this sale and disposal, the Company recognized a write-down of $5.6 million (based on fair value less cost to sell) related to GPRM which was included in Impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of operations in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRelated to the Land Operations segment, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company executed a purchase and sale agreement and consummated the sale of assets related to its solar power facility in Port Allen on Kauai for purchase consideration (measured at the date of disposal) of approximately $17.1 million. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a gain on disposal of approximately $8.9 million which was included in Gain (loss) on disposal of non-core assets, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nMoreover, related to its unconsolidated equity method investments in joint venture development projects at Kukui\u2018ula, the Company continues its evaluation of opportunities to monetize these investments or, in conjunction with the joint venture partners, its evaluation of a range of alternative strategies to accelerate the monetization of the land in the joint venture projects. Any potential transaction related to either the investments or the assets within the joint venture projects would be dependent upon a number of external factors that may be beyond the Company's and/or joint venture projects' control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends and the interest of third parties in the Kukui\u2018ula development projects. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of the options evaluated will be pursued or completed. Further, there can be no assurance that the outcome of the evaluation of strategic alternatives or any potential transaction will result in the Company being able to maintain the carrying value of the Kukui\u2018ula joint venture development projects.\nCoronavirus outbreak\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the global economy and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. Considerable uncertainty surrounds COVID-19 and its effects on the population, as well as the effectiveness of any responses taken by government authorities. The pandemic resulted in a significant decline in Hawai\u2018i tourism and increase in business closures during the year ended December 31, 2020; it has significantly impacted the Company's business due largely to the extreme hardships facing its retail tenants. The ultimate extent of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources will largely depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, the severity of economic disruptions and resulting impact on economic growth/recession, the response by all levels of government in their efforts to contain the outbreak and to mitigate the economic disruptions, the impact on travel and tourism behavior and the impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted.\nAs of February 12, 2021, all of the Company's properties within its CRE portfolio remain open and substantially all of its existing tenants remain open and operating in some capacity. Further, as of this date, the CRE portfolio tenants have paid approximately 84% of their fourth quarter billings and 84% of their January 2021 lease billings (which includes base rents and recoveries from tenants). Within this population, the Company's grocer tenants (designated as essential businesses and located within its grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers), have paid approximately 93% of their fourth quarter billings and approximately 85% of their January 2021 lease billings.\nAs a result of COVID-19, certain tenants experiencing economic difficulties have sought and may continue to seek current and future rent relief, which may be provided in the form of rent deferrals or other relief modifications that result in changes to fixed contractual lease payments for specific months, among other possible arrangements.\nStarting in and during the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, rent assistance provided to certain tenants primarily consisted of rent deferrals which varied in terms of months covered and the repayment period (e.g., on a short-term basis to be repaid over the second half of 2020 or on a long-term basis to be repaid over 2021). Subsequent to June 30, 2020 and during the remainder of the year ended December 31, 2020, rent assistance arrangements involved additional deferrals as well as other relief modifications, including modifying the nature of rent payments from fixed to variable (i.e., variable based on a percentage of the tenant's sales, typically subject to a minimum \"floor\" amount) or, in some cases, payment forgiveness.\nAs of December 31, 2020, rent assistance arrangements offered and agreed to with tenants as a result of COVID-19 were as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company estimated a higher amount of uncollectable tenant billings due to COVID-19, pursuant to which the reductions in revenue the Company recorded as a result of such assessments were as follows (in millions):\n\nThe Company's financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in reductions in operating profit and its non-GAAP performance measures. As such, the comparability of\nthe Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 to future periods may be significantly impacted by the effects of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto.\n\nThe causes of material changes in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 are described below or in the Analysis of Operating Revenue and Profit by Segment sections below.\nOperating revenue for 2020 decreased 29.8%, or $129.9 million, to $305.3 million due primarily to lower revenue from the Land Operations segment and Materials & Construction segment.\nCost of operations for 2020 decreased 31.5%, or $107.4 million, to $233.5 million, due primarily to lower costs from the Land Operations segment and Materials & Construction segment.\nSelling, general and administrative for 2020 decreased 21.7%, or $12.8 million, to $46.1 million primarily due to lower corporate overhead costs, as well as lower costs incurred in the Materials & Construction and CRE segments. Corporate overhead costs decreased from the prior period primarily due to lower personnel-related costs.\nImpairment of assets for 2020 related to the sale and disposal of GPRM at the close of the quarter ended June 30, 2020. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company recorded impairments of $49.7 million related to goodwill and long-lived assets for the quarry & paving operations in its Materials & Construction segment.\nGain (loss) on disposal of assets, net was $9.6 million in 2020, primarily driven by the consummation of the sale of assets related to the Company's solar power facility in Port Allen on Kauai as previously described.\nAnalysis of Operating Revenue and Profit by Segment\nThe following analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto.\nCommercial Real Estate\nFinancial results\nResults of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\nCommercial Real Estate operating revenue decreased 6.6% or $10.6 million, to $150.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating profit decreased 24.8%, or $16.4 million, to $49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in each of Commercial Real Estate operating revenue and operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects revenue charges of $19.0 million related to the collectability of tenant billings that the Company recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, as well as the impact of other relief modifications (e.g., rent forgiveness) and other adjustments provided in the period of $6.4 million (described above). Such decreases in revenue and operating profit were partially offset by the positive impacts to revenue and operating profit of properties acquired in the first half of 2019 and redevelopment/new development projects commencing operations (which was also the primary driver of an increase in operating costs and expenses of 7.4% or $6.6 million to $95.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020). Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.6 million from the prior year primarily driven by lower personnel cost.\nCommercial Real Estate interest and other income (expense), net from the prior year was primarily driven by interest income earned on \u00a71031 exchange funds from the sale of agricultural land on Maui in 2018 (which were utilized as of the end of the quarter ended June 30, 2019).\nCommercial Real Estate portfolio acquisitions and dispositions\nThere were no acquisitions of CRE improved properties or ground lease interest in land during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made the following disposition within one of its commercial real estate properties under a purchase option held and executed by the then-current tenant as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nLeasing activity\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company signed 68 new leases and 152 renewal leases for its improved properties across its three asset classes, covering 919,425 square feet of GLA. The 68 new leases consist of 141,675 square feet with an average annual base rent of $22.82 per-square-foot. Of the 68 new leases, 13 leases with a total GLA of 13,817 square feet were considered comparable (i.e., leases executed for units that have been vacated in the previous 12 months for comparable space and comparable lease terms) and, for these 13 leases, resulted in a 3.1% average base rent decrease over comparable expiring leases. The 152 renewal leases consist of 777,750 square feet with an average annual base rent of $24.77 per square foot. Of the 152 renewal leases, 89 leases with a total GLA of 575,539 were considered comparable and resulted in a 7.7% average base rent increase over comparable expiring leases.\nLeasing activity summarized by asset class for the year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows:\n\n1 Rent spread is calculated for comparable leases, a subset of the total population of leases for the period presented (described above).\nOccupancy\nOccupancy represents the percentage of square footage leased and commenced to gross leasable space at the end of the period reported. The Company's commercial portfolio occupancy - and occupancy metrics for a category of properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of the prior calendar year and current period, to date (\"Same-Store\" as more fully described below) - summarized by asset class as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\n\nLand Operations\nTrends, events and uncertainties\nThe asset class mix of real estate sales in any given period can be diverse and may include developed residential real estate, developable subdivision lots, undeveloped land or property sold under threat of condemnation. Further, the timing of property or parcel sales can significantly affect operating results in a given period.\nAdditionally, the operating profit reported in each period does not necessarily follow a percentage of sales trend because the cost basis of property sold can differ significantly between transactions. For example, the sale of undeveloped land and vacant parcels in Hawai\u2018i may result in higher margins than the sale of developed property due to the low historical cost basis of the Company's land owned in Hawai\u2018i.\nAs a result, direct year-over-year comparison of the Land Operations segment results may not provide a consistent, measurable indicator of future performance. Further, Land Operations revenue trends, cash flows from the sales of real estate, and the amount of real estate held for sale on the Company's consolidated balance sheet do not necessarily indicate future profitability trends for this segment.\nFinancial results\nResults of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\n2020: Land Operations revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $40.6 million and included the sales of development parcels at Maui Business Park II and unimproved land sales on the island of Kauai and Maui. Revenue also included other operating revenue related to the Company's legacy business activities in the Land Operations segment (e.g., trucking service, renewable energy, and diversified agribusiness operations).\nLand Operations operating profit of $17.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by the gain of $8.9 million realized on the sale of the Company's solar power facility in Port Allen during the third quarter and was also composed of the margins on the sales noted above, as well as profits generated from the operations of the segment's other legacy business activities. Other notable items within operating profit during the year ended December 31, 2020 included a charge of $6.7 million related to the estimated costs of probable remediation work for reservoirs on Kauai, as well as the impact of a favorable resolution of certain contingent liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the sale of agricultural land on Maui in 2018.\n2019: Land Operations revenue of $114.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by development sales activity which included three of the remaining Kahala Avenue acres; 44 of the remaining units for the Company's Kamalani project in Kihei, Maui; nine acres at Maui Business Park (Phase II); unimproved/other property sales activity related to the sale of land and related property and rights in Wailea, Maui; and the sale of unimproved property of approximately 800 acres of agricultural land on Maui.\nMaterials & Construction\nFinancial results\nResults of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\n1 Intersegment operating charges, net for Materials & Construction represent amounts primarily from the Commercial Real Estate segment and are eliminated in the consolidated results of operations.\n2 Backlog represents the total amount of revenue that Grace Pacific and Maui Paving, LLC, a 50-percent-owned unconsolidated affiliate, expect to realize on contracts awarded. Backlog primarily consists of asphalt paving and, to a lesser extent, Grace Pacific's consolidated revenue from its construction-and traffic control-related products. Backlog includes estimated revenue from the remaining portion of contracts not yet completed, as well as revenue from approved change orders. The length of time that projects remain in backlog can span from a few days for a small volume of work to 36 months for large paving contracts and contracts performed in phases. This amount includes opportunity backlog consisting of government contracts in which Grace Pacific has been confirmed to be the lowest bidder and formal communication of the award is perfunctory at the time of this disclosure (such amounts were $64.1 million and $7.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively). Circumstances outside the Company's control such as procurement or technical protests may arise that prevent the finalization of such contracts. Maui Paving's backlog as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $5.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively.\nMaterials & Construction revenue was $114.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $160.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating loss was $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the segment operating loss was largely driven by a write-down of $5.6 million related to the sale of the Company's interest in GPRM which was completed during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the segment operating loss of $69.2 million was primarily driven by the $49.7 million non-cash impairment to the carrying value of the Company's goodwill balance.\nThe remaining operating loss during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due primarily to the impact of low paving volumes resulting from government agency-imposed project delays and the impact of COVID-19 (including travel restrictions and resource availability for projects on neighbor islands) during the second quarter as well as the fourth quarter; these losses were only partially offset by the operating profit generated in the third quarter (primarily driven by improved volume and resulting financial performance from Grace paving and quarry operations). The Company is continuing to monitor the performance of the M&C segment in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, based on the inherent uncertainty in the general economic environment, there can be no assurance that the carrying values associated with the long-lived assets and goodwill will be recoverable and impairments on such long-lived assets and goodwill may be required.\nBacklog at December 31, 2020 was $126.7 million (as a result of the disposal of GPRM at the end of the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, this metric excludes backlog related to GPRM). On a comparable basis (i.e., adjusted to exclude GPRM backlog of $20.8 million as of December 31, 2019), backlog increased from $58.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase in backlog was primarily driven by an increase in the amount of marketed bid opportunities and an improvement in the rate of bids won by the Company.\nRelated to the calculation of the backlog metric, as noted in prior periods, certain agencies award \"maintenance contracts\" under which a contractor can secure all paving work within a certain geographic area, but jobs are not identified in\nadvance (and, therefore, will not meet the requirement for inclusion in backlog). Under this maintenance contract system, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also secured significant maintenance contract awards, including the Oahu State Pavement Preservation maintenance contracts for the entire island of Oahu. Procedurally, the Company must receive specific work orders that would meet the definition of backlog and provide actionable scopes of work, including quantities, location, materials and project economics.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because management believes that they provide additional insight into the Company's and segments' core operating results, and/or the underlying business trends affecting performance on a consistent and comparable basis from period to period. These measures generally are provided to investors as an additional means of evaluating the performance of ongoing core operations. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nFFO is presented by the Company as a widely used non-GAAP measure of operating performance for real estate companies. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\") December 2018 Financial Standards White Paper as follows: net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding (1) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (2) gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, (3) gains and losses from change in control and (4) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity.\nThe Company believes that, subject to the following limitations, FFO provides a supplemental measure to net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) for comparing its performance and operations to those of other REITs. FFO does not represent an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of the Company's liquidity. The Company presents different forms of FFO:\n\u2022\"Core FFO\" represents a non-GAAP measure relevant to the operating performance of the Company's commercial real estate business (i.e., its core business). Core FFO is calculated by adjusting CRE operating profit to exclude items noted above (i.e., depreciation and amortization related to real estate included in CRE operating profit) and to make further adjustments to include expenses not included in CRE operating profit but that are necessary to accurately reflect the operating performance of its core business (i.e., corporate expenses and interest expense attributable to this core business). The Company believes such adjustments facilitate the comparable measurement of the Company's core operating performance over time. The Company believes that Core FFO, which is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, provides an additional and useful means to assess and compare the operating performance of REITs.\n\u2022FFO represents the Nareit-defined non-GAAP measure for the operating performance of the Company as a whole. The Company's calculation refers to net income (loss) available to A&B common shareholders as its starting point in the calculation of FFO.\nThe Company presents both non-GAAP measures and reconciles each to the most directly-comparable GAAP measure as well as reconciling FFO to Core FFO. The Company's FFO and Core FFO may not be comparable to FFO non-GAAP measures reported by other REITs. These other REITs may not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or may interpret the current Nareit definition differently.\nNOI is a non-GAAP measure used internally in evaluating the unlevered performance of the Company's Commercial Real Estate portfolio. The Company believes NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only the contractual income and cash-based expense items that are incurred at the property level. When compared across periods, NOI can be used to determine trends in earnings of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by non-contractual revenue (e.g., straight-line lease adjustments required under GAAP); by non-cash expense recognition items (e.g., the impact of depreciation and amortization expense or impairments); or by other expenses or gains or losses that do not directly relate to the Company's ownership and operations of the properties (e.g., indirect selling, general, administrative and other expenses, as well as lease termination income). The Company believes the exclusion of these items from operating profit (loss) is useful because the resulting measure captures the contractually-based revenue that is realizable (i.e., assuming collectability is deemed probable) and the direct property-related expenses paid or payable in cash that are incurred in operating the Company's Commercial Real Estate portfolio, as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. NOI should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nNOI represents total Commercial Real Estate contractually-based operating revenue that is realizable (i.e., assuming collectability is deemed probable) less the direct property-related operating expenses paid or payable in cash. The calculation of NOI excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization (e.g., depreciation related to capitalized costs for improved properties, other capital expenditures for building/area improvements and tenant space improvements, as well as amortization of leasing commissions); straight-line lease adjustments (including amortization of lease incentives); amortization of favorable/unfavorable lease assets/liabilities; lease termination income; interest and other income (expense), net; selling, general, administrative and other expenses (not directly associated with the property); and impairment of commercial real estate assets.\nThe Company reports NOI and Occupancy on a Same-Store basis, which includes the results of properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of the prior calendar year and current reporting period, year-to-date. The Same-Store pool excludes properties under development or redevelopment and also excludes properties acquired or sold during either of the comparable reporting periods. While there is management judgment involved in classifications, new developments and redevelopments are moved into the Same-Store pool after one full calendar year of stabilized operation. Properties included in held for sale are excluded from Same-Store.\nThe Company believes that reporting on a Same-Store basis provides investors with additional information regarding the operating performance of comparable assets separate from other factors (such as the effect of developments, redevelopments, acquisitions or dispositions).\nTo emphasize, the Company's methods of calculating non-GAAP measures may differ from methods employed by other companies and thus may not be comparable to such other companies.\nReconciliations of net income (loss) available to A&B common shareholders to FFO and Core FFO for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in millions):\n\nReconciliations of Core FFO starting from CRE operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in millions):\n\nReconciliations of CRE operating profit (loss) to NOI for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in millions):\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAmounts in the MD&A are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million. Accordingly, a recalculation of totals and percentages, if based on the reported data, may be slightly different.\nBusiness Overview\nReportable segments\nThe Company operates three segments: Commercial Real Estate; Land Operations; and Materials & Construction. A description of each of the Company's reporting segments is as follows:\n\u2022Commercial Real Estate (\"CRE\") - This segment functions as a vertically integrated real estate investment company with core competencies in investments and acquisitions (i.e., identifying opportunities and acquiring properties); construction and development (i.e., designing and ground-up development of new properties or repositioning and redevelopment of existing properties); and in-house leasing and property management (i.e., executing new and renegotiating renewal lease arrangements, managing its properties' day-to-day operations and maintaining positive tenant relationships). The Company's preferred asset classes include improved properties in retail and industrial spaces and also urban ground leases. Its focus within improved retail properties, in particular, is on grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers that meet the daily needs of Hawai\u2018i citizens. Through its core competencies and with its experience and relationships in Hawai\u2018i, the Company seeks to create special places that enhance the lives of Hawai\u2018i residents and to provide venues and opportunities that enable its tenants to thrive. Income from this segment is principally generated by owning, operating and leasing real estate assets.\n\u2022Land Operations - This segment includes the Company's legacy assets and landholdings that are subject to the Company's simplification and monetization effort. Financial results from this segment are principally derived from real estate development and land sales, income/loss from real estate joint ventures, hydroelectric energy and other legacy business activities.\n\u2022Materials & Construction (\"M&C\") - This segment operates as Hawai\u2018i's largest asphalt paving contractor and is one of the state's largest natural materials and infrastructure construction companies. Such activities are primarily conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Grace Pacific LLC (\"Grace Pacific\"), a materials and construction company in Hawai\u2018i.\nSimplification strategy\nAs a result of its conversion to a REIT and consequent de-emphasis of non-REIT operating businesses, the Company has established a strategy to simplify its business, which includes ongoing efforts to accelerate the monetization of land and related assets and also includes evaluating strategic options for the eventual monetization of some or all of its Materials & Construction businesses.\nWhile the Company continues to evaluate options for the Grace Pacific paving business, during the second quarter of 2020, the Company consummated the sale of one of Grace Pacific's subsidiary operations, GP/RM Prestress, LLC (\"GPRM\"), a provider of precast/prestressed concrete products and services (which the Company historically consolidated through the disposal date due to holding a controlling financial interest through its majority voting interests). In connection with this sale and disposal, the Company recognized a write-down of $5.6 million (based on fair value less cost to sell) related to GPRM which was included in Impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of operations in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRelated to the Land Operations segment, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company executed a purchase and sale agreement and consummated the sale of assets related to its solar power facility in Port Allen on Kauai for purchase consideration (measured at the date of disposal) of approximately $17.1 million. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a gain on disposal of approximately $8.9 million which was included in Gain (loss) on disposal of non-core assets, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nMoreover, related to its unconsolidated equity method investments in joint venture development projects at Kukui\u2018ula, the Company continues its evaluation of opportunities to monetize these investments or, in conjunction with the joint venture partners, its evaluation of a range of alternative strategies to accelerate the monetization of the land in the joint venture projects. Any potential transaction related to either the investments or the assets within the joint venture projects would be dependent upon a number of external factors that may be beyond the Company's and/or joint venture projects' control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends and the interest of third parties in the Kukui\u2018ula development projects. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of the options evaluated will be pursued or completed. Further, there can be no assurance that the outcome of the evaluation of strategic alternatives or any potential transaction will result in the Company being able to maintain the carrying value of the Kukui\u2018ula joint venture development projects.\nCoronavirus outbreak\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the global economy and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. Considerable uncertainty surrounds COVID-19 and its effects on the population, as well as the effectiveness of any responses taken by government authorities. The pandemic resulted in a significant decline in Hawai\u2018i tourism and increase in business closures during the year ended December 31, 2020; it has significantly impacted the Company's business due largely to the extreme hardships facing its retail tenants. The ultimate extent of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources will largely depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, the severity of economic disruptions and resulting impact on economic growth/recession, the response by all levels of government in their efforts to contain the outbreak and to mitigate the economic disruptions, the impact on travel and tourism behavior and the impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted.\nAs of February 12, 2021, all of the Company's properties within its CRE portfolio remain open and substantially all of its existing tenants remain open and operating in some capacity. Further, as of this date, the CRE portfolio tenants have paid approximately 84% of their fourth quarter billings and 84% of their January 2021 lease billings (which includes base rents and recoveries from tenants). Within this population, the Company's grocer tenants (designated as essential businesses and located within its grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers), have paid approximately 93% of their fourth quarter billings and approximately 85% of their January 2021 lease billings.\nAs a result of COVID-19, certain tenants experiencing economic difficulties have sought and may continue to seek current and future rent relief, which may be provided in the form of rent deferrals or other relief modifications that result in changes to fixed contractual lease payments for specific months, among other possible arrangements.\nStarting in and during the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, rent assistance provided to certain tenants primarily consisted of rent deferrals which varied in terms of months covered and the repayment period (e.g., on a short-term basis to be repaid over the second half of 2020 or on a long-term basis to be repaid over 2021). Subsequent to June 30, 2020 and during the remainder of the year ended December 31, 2020, rent assistance arrangements involved additional deferrals as well as other relief modifications, including modifying the nature of rent payments from fixed to variable (i.e., variable based on a percentage of the tenant's sales, typically subject to a minimum \"floor\" amount) or, in some cases, payment forgiveness.\nAs of December 31, 2020, rent assistance arrangements offered and agreed to with tenants as a result of COVID-19 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Number of tenants </td> <td> </td> <td>Total impacted lease billings </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent deferrals </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other relief modifications1\n</td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 Certain tenants that were provided other relief modifications may have also been subject to rent deferrals.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company estimated a higher amount of uncollectable tenant billings due to COVID-19, pursuant to which the reductions in revenue the Company recorded as a result of such assessments were as follows (in millions):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact to billed accounts receivable </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact to straight-line lease receivables </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue reductions - tenant collectability assessments </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for allowance for doubtful accounts1\n</td> <td>3.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue reductions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 Related to other impacted operating lease receivables.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in reductions in operating profit and its non-GAAP performance measures. As such, the comparability of\nthe Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 to future periods may be significantly impacted by the effects of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries should be read in

ended December 31, 2019 are described below or in the Analysis of Operating Revenue and Profit by Segment sections below.\nOperating revenue for 2020 decreased 29.8%, or $129.9 million, to $305.3 million due primarily to lower revenue from the Land Operations segment and Materials & Construction segment.\nCost of operations for 2020 decreased 31.5%, or $107.4 million, to $233.5 million, due primarily to lower costs from the Land Operations segment and Materials & Construction segment.\nSelling, general and administrative for 2020 decreased 21.7%, or $12.8 million, to $46.1 million primarily due to lower corporate overhead costs, as well as lower costs incurred in the Materials & Construction and CRE segments. Corporate overhead costs decreased from the prior period primarily due to lower personnel-related costs.\nImpairment of assets for 2020 related to the sale and disposal of GPRM at the close of the quarter ended June 30, 2020. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company recorded impairments of $49.7 million related to goodwill and long-lived assets for the quarry & paving operations in its Materials & Construction segment.\nGain (loss) on disposal of assets, net was $9.6 million in 2020, primarily driven by the consummation of the sale of assets related to the Company's solar power facility in Port Allen on Kauai as previously described.\nAnalysis of Operating Revenue and Profit by Segment\nThe following analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes

2019. Operating profit decreased 24.8%, or $16.4 million, to $49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in each of Commercial Real Estate operating revenue and operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects revenue charges of $19.0 million related to the collectability of tenant billings that the Company recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, as well as the impact of other relief modifications (e.g., rent forgiveness) and other adjustments provided in the period of $6.4 million (described above). Such decreases in revenue and operating profit were partially offset by the positive impacts to revenue and operating profit of properties acquired in the first half of 2019 and redevelopment/new development projects commencing operations (which was also the primary driver of an increase in operating costs and expenses of 7.4% or $6.6 million to $95.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020). Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.6 million from the prior year primarily driven by lower personnel cost.\nCommercial Real Estate interest and other income (expense), net from the prior year was primarily driven by interest income earned on \u00a71031 exchange funds from the sale of agricultural land on Maui in 2018 (which were utilized as of the end of the quarter ended June 30, 2019).\nCommercial Real Estate portfolio acquisitions and dispositions\nThere were no acquisitions of CRE improved properties or ground lease interest in land during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made the following disposition within one of its commercial real estate properties under a purchase option held and executed by the then-current tenant as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dispositions </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property </td> <td> </td> <td>Location </td> <td> </td> <td>Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Purchase Price </td> <td> </td> <td>GLA (SF) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Collection (Suites 2 & 3) </td> <td> </td> <td>Oahu, HI </td> <td> </td> <td>2/20 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,100 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeasing activity\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company signed 68 new leases and 152 renewal leases for its improved properties across its three asset classes, covering 919,425 square feet of GLA. The 68 new leases consist of 141,675 square feet with an average annual base rent of $22.82 per-square-foot. Of the 68 new leases, 13 leases with a total GLA of 13,817 square feet were considered comparable (i.e., leases executed for units that have been vacated in the previous 12 months for comparable space and comparable lease terms) and, for these 13 leases, resulted in a 3.1% average base rent decrease over comparable expiring leases. The 152 renewal leases consist of 777,750 square feet with an average annual base rent of $24.77 per square foot. Of the 152 renewal leases, 89 leases with a total GLA of 575,539 were considered comparable and resulted in a 7.7% average base rent increase over comparable expiring leases.\nLeasing activity summarized by asset class for the year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Leases </td> <td>GLA </td> <td>ABR/SF </td> <td>Rent Spread1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail </td> <td>141 </td> <td>610,903 </td> <td>$28.76 </td> <td>6.9% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial </td> <td>64 </td> <td>276,692 </td> <td>$14.23 </td> <td>10.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office </td> <td>15 </td> <td>31,830 </td> <td>$31.33 </td> <td>1.7% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Rent spread is calculated for comparable leases, a subset of the total population of leases for the period presented (described above).\nOccupancy\nOccupancy represents the percentage of square footage leased and commenced to gross leasable space at the end of the period reported.

Further, the timing of property or parcel sales can significantly affect operating results in a given period.\nAdditionally, the operating profit reported in each period does not necessarily follow a percentage of sales trend because the cost basis of property sold can differ significantly between transactions. For example, the sale of undeveloped land and vacant parcels in Hawai\u2018i may result in higher margins than the sale of developed property due to the low historical cost basis of the Company's land owned in Hawai\u2018i.\nAs a result, direct year-over-year comparison of the Land Operations segment results may not provide a consistent, measurable indicator of future performance. Further, Land Operations revenue trends, cash flows from the sales of real estate, and the amount of real estate held for sale on the Company's consolidated balance sheet do not necessarily indicate future profitability trends for this segment.\nFinancial results\nResults of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in millions; unaudited) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development sales revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unimproved/other property sales revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating revenue1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Land Operations operating revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>40.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land Operations operating costs and expenses2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(31.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on disposal of assets, net </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings (loss) from joint ventures </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income (expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Land Operations operating profit (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 Other operating revenue includes revenue related to trucking, renewable energy and diversified agriculture.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 Includes intersegment operating charges primarily from CRE that are eliminated in the consolidated results of operations.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2020: Land Operations revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $40.6 million and included the sales of development parcels at Maui Business Park II and unimproved land sales on the island of Kauai and Maui. Revenue also included other operating revenue related to the Company's legacy business activities in the Land Operations segment (e.g., trucking service, renewable energy, and diversified agribusiness operations).\nLand Operations operating profit of $17.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by the gain of $8.9 million realized on the sale of the Company's solar power facility in Port Allen during the third quarter and was also composed of the margins on the sales noted above, as well as profits generated from the operations of the segment's other legacy business activities. Other notable items within operating profit during the year ended December 31, 2020 included a charge of $6.7 million related to the estimated costs of probable remediation work for reservoirs on Kauai, as well as the impact of a favorable resolution of certain contingent liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the sale of agricultural land on Maui in 2018.\n2019: Land Operations revenue of $114.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by development sales activity which included three of the remaining Kahala Avenue acres; 44 of the remaining units for the Company's Kamalani project in Kihei, Maui; nine acres at Maui Business Park (Phase II); unimproved/other property sales activity related to the sale of land and related property and rights in Wailea, Maui;

Backlog primarily consists of asphalt paving and, to a lesser extent, Grace Pacific's consolidated revenue from its construction-and traffic control-related products. Backlog includes estimated revenue from the remaining portion of contracts not yet completed, as well as revenue from approved change orders. The length of time that projects remain in backlog can span from a few days for a small volume of work to 36 months for large paving contracts and contracts performed in phases. This amount includes opportunity backlog consisting of government contracts in which Grace Pacific has been confirmed to be the lowest bidder and formal communication of the award is perfunctory at the time of this disclosure (such amounts were $64.1 million and $7.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively). Circumstances outside the Company's control such as procurement or technical protests may arise that prevent the finalization of such contracts. Maui Paving's backlog as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $5.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively.\nMaterials & Construction revenue was $114.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $160.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating loss was $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the segment operating loss was largely driven by a write-down of $5.6 million related to the sale of the Company's interest in GPRM which was completed during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the segment operating loss of $69.2 million was primarily driven by the $49.7 million non-cash impairment to the carrying value of the Company's goodwill balance.\nThe remaining operating loss during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due primarily to the impact of low paving volumes resulting from government agency-imposed project delays and the impact of COVID-19 (including travel restrictions and resource availability for projects on neighbor islands) during the second quarter as well as the fourth quarter; these losses were only partially offset by the operating profit generated in the third quarter (primarily driven by improved volume and resulting financial performance from Grace paving and quarry operations). The Company is continuing to monitor the performance of the M&C segment in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, based on the inherent uncertainty in the general economic environment, there can be no assurance that the carrying values associated with the long-lived assets and goodwill will be recoverable and impairments on such long-lived assets and goodwill may be required.\nBacklog at December 31, 2020 was $126.7 million (as a result of the disposal of GPRM at the end of the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, this metric excludes backlog related to GPRM). On a comparable basis (i.e., adjusted to exclude GPRM backlog of $20.8 million as of December 31, 2019), backlog increased from $58.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase in backlog was primarily driven by an increase in the amount of marketed bid opportunities and an improvement in the rate of bids won by the Company.\nRelated to the calculation of the backlog metric, as noted in prior periods, certain agencies award \"maintenance contracts\" under which a contractor can secure all paving work within a certain geographic area, but jobs are not identified in\nadvance (and, therefore, will not meet the requirement for inclusion in backlog). Under this maintenance contract system, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also secured significant maintenance contract awards, including the Oahu State Pavement Preservation maintenance contracts for the entire island of Oahu. Procedurally, the Company must receive specific work orders that would meet the definition of backlog and provide actionable scopes of work, including quantities, location, materials and project economics.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because management believes that they provide additional insight into the Company's and segments' core operating results, and/or the underlying business trends affecting performance on a consistent and comparable basis from period to period. These measures generally are provided to investors as an additional means of evaluating the performance of ongoing core operations. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nFFO is presented by the Company as a widely used non-GAAP measure of operating performance for real estate companies. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\") December 2018 Financial Standards White Paper as follows: net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding (1) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (2) gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, (3) gains and losses from change in control and (4) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity.\nThe Company believes that, subject to the following limitations, FFO provides a supplemental measure to net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) for comparing its performance and operations to those of other REITs. FFO does not represent an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of the Company's liquidity. The Company presents different forms of FFO:\n\u2022\"Core FFO\" represents a non-GAAP measure relevant to the operating performance of the Company's commercial real estate business (i.e., its core business). Core FFO is calculated by adjusting CRE operating profit to exclude items noted above (i.e., depreciation and amortization related to real estate included in CRE operating profit) and to make further adjustments to include expenses not included in CRE operating profit but that are necessary to accurately reflect the operating performance of its core business (i.e., corporate expenses and interest expense attributable to this core business). The Company believes such adjustments facilitate the comparable measurement of the Company's core operating performance over time. The Company believes that Core FFO, which is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, provides an additional and useful means to assess and compare the operating performance of REITs.\n\u2022FFO represents the Nareit-defined non-GAAP measure for the operating performance of the Company as a whole. The Company's calculation refers to net income (loss) available to A&B common shareholders as its starting point in the calculation of FFO.\nThe Company presents both non-GAAP measures and reconciles each to the most directly-comparable GAAP measure as well as reconciling FFO to Core FFO. The Company's FFO and Core FFO may not be comparable to FFO non-GAAP measures reported by other REITs. These other REITs may not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or may interpret the current Nareit definition differently.\nNOI is a non-GAAP measure used internally in evaluating the unlevered performance of the Company's Commercial Real Estate portfolio. The Company believes NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only the contractual income and cash-based expense items that are incurred at the property level. When compared across periods, NOI can be used to determine trends in earnings of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by non-contractual revenue (e.g., straight-line lease adjustments required under GAAP); by non-cash expense recognition items (e.g., the impact of depreciation and amortization expense or impairments); or by other expenses or gains or losses that do not directly relate to the Company's ownership and operations of the properties (e.g., indirect selling, general, administrative and other expenses, as well as lease termination income). The Company believes the exclusion of these items from operating profit (loss) is useful because the resulting measure captures the contractually-based revenue that is realizable (i.e., assuming collectability is deemed probable) and the direct property-related expenses paid or payable in cash that are incurred in operating the Company's Commercial Real Estate portfolio, as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. NOI should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nNOI represents total Commercial Real Estate contractually-based operating revenue that is realizable (i.e., assuming collectability is deemed probable) less the direct property-related operating expenses paid or payable in cash. The calculation of NOI excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization (e.g., depreciation related to capitalized costs for improved properties, other capital expenditures for building/area improvements and tenant space improvements, as well as amortization of leasing commissions); straight-line lease adjustments (including amortization of lease incentives); amortization of favorable/unfavorable lease assets/liabilities; lease termination income; interest and other income (expense), net; selling, general, administrative and other expenses (not directly associated with the property); and impairment of commercial real estate assets.\nThe Company reports NOI and Occupancy on a Same-Store basis, which includes the results of properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of the prior calendar year and current reporting period, year-to-date. The Same-Store pool excludes properties under development or redevelopment and also excludes properties acquired or sold during either of the comparable reporting periods. While there is management judgment involved in classifications, new developments and redevelopments are moved into the Same-Store pool after one full calendar year of stabilized operation. Properties included in held for sale are excluded from Same-Store.\nThe Company believes that reporting on a Same-Store basis provides investors with additional information regarding the operating performance of comparable assets separate from other factors (such as the effect of developments, redevelopments, acquisitions or dispositions).\nTo emphasize, the Company's methods of calculating non-GAAP measures may differ from methods employed by other companies and thus may not be comparable to such other companies.\nReconciliations of net income (loss) available to A&B common shareholders to FFO and Core FFO for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in millions):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) available to A&B common shareholders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(36.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization of commercial real estate properties </td> <td> </td> <td>40.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on the disposal of commercial real estate properties, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of CRE assets </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exclude items not related to core business: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land Operations Operating Profit </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Materials & Construction Operating (Profit) Loss </td> <td> </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-core business interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core FFO </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nReconciliations of Core FFO starting from CRE operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in millions):\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CRE Operating Profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization of commercial real estate properties </td> <td> </td> <td>40.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core business interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions to participating securities </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core FFO </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nReconciliations of CRE operating profit (loss) to NOI for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in millions):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CRE Operating Profit (Loss)"}
