Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe provide technology-enabled audit, recovery, outsource services, and related analytics services in the United States. Our services help identify improper payments, and in some markets, restructure and recover delinquent or defaulted assets and improper payments for both government and private clients in a broad range of markets. Our clients typically operate in complex and regulated environments and outsource their audit and recovery needs in order to reduce losses on billions of dollars of defaulted student loans, improper healthcare payments and delinquent state and federal tax and federal treasury and other receivables. We also provide complex outsource services for clients across our various markets, where we handle many or all aspects of our clients' audit and recovery processes.\nOur revenue model is generally success-based as we earn fees on the aggregate correct audits and/or amount of funds that we enable our clients to recover. Our services do not require any significant upfront investments by our clients and offer\nour clients the opportunity to recover significant funds otherwise lost. Because our model is based upon the success of our efforts, our business objectives are aligned with those of our clients and we are generally not reliant on their spending budgets. Furthermore, our business model does not require significant capital as we do not purchase loans or obligations.\nSources of Revenues\nWe derive our revenues from services for clients in a variety of different markets. These markets include our two largest markets, student lending and healthcare, as well as our other markets which include but are not limited to delinquent state and federal taxes and federal treasury and other receivables.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Student Lending:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Great Lakes Higher Education Guaranty Corporation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> All Other Guaranty Agencies\n</td> <td>39,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total of Student Lending\n</td> <td>66,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> CMS RAC and MSP CRC (1)\n</td> <td>41,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Commercial\n</td> <td>14,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total of Healthcare\n</td> <td>55,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (2)\n</td> <td>33,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes $28.4 million related to the termination of the 2009 CMS Region A contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents outsource services, tax, and IRS\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Student Lending\nOur revenues from the student lending market are contract-based and consist primarily of contingency fees based on a specified percentage of the amount we enable our clients to recover. Our contingency fee percentage for a particular recovery depends on the type of recovery facilitated. Our clients in the student loan recovery market mainly consist of several of the largest guaranty agencies, or GAs. We believe the size and the composition of our student loan inventory at any point provides us with a significant degree of revenue visibility for our student loan revenues. Based on data compiled from over two decades of experience with the recovery of defaulted student loans, at the time we receive a placement of student loans, we are able to make a reasonably accurate estimate of the recovery outcomes likely to be derived from such placement and the revenues we are likely able to generate based on the anticipated recovery outcomes.\nOur key metric in evaluating our student lending business is Placement Volume. Our Placement Volume represents the dollar volume of defaulted student loans first placed with us during the specified period by public and private clients for recovery. Placement Volume allows us to measure and track trends in the amount of inventory our clients in the student lending market are placing with us during any period. The revenues associated with the recovery of a portion of these loans may be recognized in subsequent accounting periods, which assists management in estimating future revenues and in allocating resources necessary to address current Placement Volumes. The following table shows our Placement Volume for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, showing separately the Placement Volume associated with student loans held by Great Lakes for which we served as the primary recovery contractor until September 2017 and since that time as a subcontractor to Navient, the primary servicer of the Great Lakes portfolio.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Student Lending Placement Volume:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Great Lakes Higher Education Guaranty Corporation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>751,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>860,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> All Other Guaranty Agencies\n</td> <td>2,565,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,018,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,313,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Student Lending Placement Volume\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,571,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,770,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,173,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere are five potential outcomes to the student loan recovery process from which we generate revenues. These outcomes include: full repayment, recurring payments, rehabilitation, loan restructuring and wage garnishment. Of these five potential outcomes, our ability to rehabilitate defaulted student loans is the most significant component of our revenues in this market. Generally, a loan is considered successfully rehabilitated after the student loan borrower has made nine consecutive qualifying monthly payments and our client has notified us that it is recalling the loan. Once we have structured and implemented a repayment program for a defaulted borrower, we (i) earn a percentage of each periodic payment collected up to and including the final periodic payment prior to the loan being considered rehabilitated\u201d by our clients, and (ii) if the loan is rehabilitated,\u201d then we are paid a one-time percentage of the total amount of the remaining unpaid balance for each rehabilitated loan. The fees we are paid vary by recovery outcome as well as by contract. For non-government-supported student loans we are generally only paid contingency fees on two outcomes: full repayment or recurring repayments. The table below describes our typical fee structure for each of these five outcomes.\nStudent Loan Recovery Outcomes\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Repayment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recurring Payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rehabilitation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loan Restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Wage Garnishment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022 Repayment in full of the loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 Regular structured payments, typically according to a renegotiated payment plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 After a defaulted borrower has made nine consecutive recurring payments, the loan is eligible for rehabilitation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 Restructure and consolidate a number of outstanding loans into a single loan, typically with one monthly payment and an extended maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 If we are unable to obtain voluntary repayment, payments may be obtained through wage garnishment after certain administrative requirements are met\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022 We are paid a percentage of the full payment that is made\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 We are paid a percentage of each payment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 We are paid based on a percentage of the overall value of the rehabilitated loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 We are paid based on a percentage of overall value of the restructured loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 We are paid a percentage of each payment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur revenues from student lending were approximately 29% lower in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily as a result of the change in our relationship with Great Lakes, for which we acted as the primary recovery contractor until September 2017 and as a subcontractor on a portion of the overall portfolio since that time.\nHealthcare\nWe derive revenues from both commercial and government clients in the healthcare market. Revenues earned under these contracts are driven by auditing, identifying, and sometimes recovering improperly paid claims through both automated and manual review of such claims. We are paid contingency fees by our clients based on a percentage of the dollar amount of improper claims recovered as a result of our efforts. The revenues we recognize are net of our estimate of claims that we believe will be overturned by appeal following payment by the provider.\nOn October 5, 2017, we announced that we were awarded the MSP CRC contract by the CMS. Under this agreement, we are responsible for identifying and recovering payments in situations where Medicare should not be the primary payer of healthcare claims because a beneficiary has other forms of insurance coverage, such as through an employer group health plan or certain other payers.\nOn October 26, 2016, CMS awarded new RAC contracts and we received RAC contracts for audit Regions 1 and 5. The RAC contract award for Region 1 allows us to continue our audit of payments under Medicare's Part A and Part B for all provider types other than DMEPOS and home health and hospice within an 11 state region in the Northeast and Midwest. The Region 5 RAC contract provides for the post-payment review of DMEPOS and home health and hospice claims nationally. While audit and recovery activity under the new contracts commenced in April 2017, the scope of audit permitted by CMS under the new RAC contracts has been limited to 0.5% of claims. We do not expect to recognize significant revenues from the newly awarded RAC contracts until the percentage of claims we are able to audit increases from the current 0.5% of the claims.\nWe accrue an estimated liability for appeals based on the amount of commissions received which are subject to appeal and which we estimate are probable of being returned to providers following successful appeal. The $18.5 million balance as of December 31, 2017, represented our best estimate of the probable amount that we may be required to refund related to appeals of claims for which commissions were previously collected. The term of our first Medicare Recovery Audit Contract with CMS, for Region A, expired on January 31, 2018. Our estimates for this appeals liability are based on our historical experience\nwith the Medicare RAC appeal process. As the term of the original contract expired, CMS issued a letter to us on January 2, 2018, stating that Performant will no longer be obligated to support the appeals process or maintain an appeal reserve after the January 31, 2018 contract termination date. In addition to the estimated liability for appeals, we also maintained a separate net payable to client liability for appeals decisions which had been decided, but not yet refunded to CMS. On January 31, 2018, CMS issued to us their final Letter of Demand which reconciled all outstanding payables to CMS for the old Region A contract. Accordingly, we released an aggregate of approximately $27.8 million and $0.6 million of the estimated liability for appeals and the net payable to client balances, during the first quarter and third quarter of 2018, respectively. This increased first quarter 2018 revenue by $27.8 million and third quarter revenue by $0.6 million. In conjunction with the release, we also derecognized approximately $9.0 million of prepaid expenses and other current assets, with a charge to other operating expenses, reflecting accrued receivables associated with amounts due to us from our subcontractors for decided and yet-to-be decided appeals. As a result, we no longer have any estimated liability for appeals relating to our first CMS contract. We have accrued $0.2 million of additional estimated liability for appeals related to other healthcare contracts at December 31, 2018.\nFor our commercial healthcare business, our business strategy is focused on utilizing our technology-enabled services platform to provide audit, recovery and analytical services for private healthcare payers. We have entered into contracts with several private payers, although these contracts are in the early stage of implementation. Revenues from our commercial healthcare clients were $14.1 million for 2018 compared to revenues of $8.5 million that we earned from our commercial healthcare clients in 2017.\nOther\nWe also derive revenues from the recovery of delinquent state and federal taxes, and federal treasury and other receivables, default aversion and/or first party call center services for certain clients and the licensing of hosted technology solutions to certain clients. For our hosted technology services, we license our system and integrate our technology into our clients' operations, for which we are paid a licensing fee. Our revenues for these services include contingency fees, fees based on dedicated headcount to our clients and hosted technology licensing fees.\nCosts and Expenses\nWe generally report two categories of operating expenses: salaries and benefits and other operating expense. Salaries and benefits expenses consist primarily of salaries and performance incentives paid and benefits provided to our employees. Other operating expense includes expenses related to our use of subcontractors, other production related expenses, including costs associated with data processing, retrieval of medical records, printing and mailing services, amortization and other outside services, as well as general corporate and administrative expenses.\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Results\nOur results of operations are influenced by a number of factors, including allocation of placement volume, claim recovery volume, contingency fees, regulatory matters, client retention and macroeconomic factors.\nAllocation of Placement Volume\nOur clients have the right to unilaterally set and increase or reduce the volume of defaulted student loans or other receivables that we service at any given time. In addition, many of our recovery contracts for student loans and other receivables are not exclusive, with our clients retaining multiple service providers to service portions of their portfolios. Accordingly, the number of delinquent student loans or other receivables that are placed with us may vary from time to time, which may have a significant effect on the amount and timing of our revenues. We believe the major factors that influence the number of placements we receive from our clients in the student loan market include our performance under our existing contracts and our ability to perform well against competitors for a particular client. To the extent that we perform well under our existing contracts and differentiate our services from those of our competitors, we may receive a relatively greater number of placements under these existing contracts and may improve our ability to obtain future contracts from these clients and other potential clients. Further, delays in placement volume, as well as acceleration of placement volume, from any of our large clients may cause our revenues and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter.\nTypically, we are able to anticipate with reasonable accuracy the timing and volume of placements of defaulted student loans and other receivables based on historical patterns and regular communication with our clients. Occasionally, however, placements are delayed due to factors outside of our control.\nContingency Fees\nOur revenues consist primarily of contract-based contingency fees. The contingency fee percentages that we earn are set by our clients or agreed upon during the bid process and may change from time to time either under the terms of existing contracts or pursuant to the terms of contract renewals.\nRegulatory Matters\nEach of the markets which we serve is highly regulated. Accordingly, changes in regulations that affect the types of loans, receivables and claims that we are able to service or the manner in which any such delinquent loans, receivables and claims can be recovered will affect our revenues and results of operations. For example, the passage of the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, or SAFRA, in 2010 had the effect of transferring the origination of all government-supported student loans to the Department of Education, thereby ending all student loan originations guaranteed by the GAs. Loans guaranteed by the GAs represented approximately 70% of government-supported student loans originated in 2009. While the GAs will continue to service existing outstanding student loans for years to come, this legislation means that there will be no further growth in student loans held by GAs. Further, we are seeing a larger amount of defaulted student loans in our GA client portfolios that have been previously rehabilitated and by regulation are not subject to rehabilitation for a second time. In addition, our entry into the healthcare market was facilitated by passage of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which mandated CMS to contract with private firms to audit Medicare claims in an effort to increase the recovery of improper Medicare payments. Any changes to the regulations that affect the student loan industry or the recovery of defaulted student loans or the Medicare program generally or the audit and recovery of Medicare claims could have a significant impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nClient Contract Cancellation\nSubstantially all of our contracts entitle our clients to unilaterally terminate their contractual relationship with us at any time without penalty. If we lose one or more of our significant clients, including if one of our significant clients is consolidated by an entity that does not use our services, if the terms of compensation for our services change or if there is a reduction in the level of placements provided by any of these clients, our revenues could decline.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nCertain macroeconomic factors influence our business and results of operations. These include the increasing volume of student loan originations in the U.S. as a result of increased tuition costs and student enrollment, the default rate of student loan borrowers, the growth in Medicare expenditures resulting from increasing healthcare costs, as well as the fiscal budget tightening of federal, state and local governments as a result of general economic weakness and lower tax revenues.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period-to-period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU that amends the FASB ASC by creating a new Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We adopted Topic 606 as of January 1, 2018, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition. We applied Topic 606 retrospectively for all reporting periods presented before January 1, 2018, the date of the initial application. There was no impact of adopting Topic 606 on our 2017 and 2016 consolidated financial statements.\nWe derive our revenues primarily from providing recovery services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Identification of the contract with a customer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Determination of the transaction price\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nOur contracts generally contain a single performance obligation, delivered over time as a series of services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to a client, as the promise to transfer the individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. We determine the standalone selling prices by taking into consideration the value of the services being provided, the client type and how similar services are priced in other contracts on a standalone basis.\nOur contracts are composed primarily of variable consideration. Fees earned under our recovery service contracts consist primarily of contingency fees based on a specified percentage of the amount we enable our clients to recover. The contingency fee percentage for a particular recovery depends on the type of recovery or claim facilitated. In certain contracts we can earn additional performance-based consideration determined based on its performance relative to a client's other contractors providing similar services.\nRevenue from contingency fees earned upon recovery of funds is generally recognized as amounts are invoiced based on either the \u2018as-invoiced' practical expedient when such amounts reflect the value of the services completed to-date, or an output metric used to measure progress of the satisfaction of its performance obligation. We estimate any performance-based variable consideration and recognizes such revenue over the performance period only if it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Under certain contracts, consideration can include periodic performance-based bonuses which can be awarded based on our performance under the specific contract. These performance-based awards are considered variable and may be constrained by us until there is not a risk of a material reversal.\nFor contracts that contain a refund right, these amounts are considered variable consideration, and we estimate our refund liability for each claim and recognizes revenue net of such estimate.\nWe generally either apply the as-invoiced practical expedient where our right to consideration corresponds directly to our right to invoice our clients, or the variable consideration allocation exception where the variable consideration is attributable to one or more, but not all, of the services promised in a series of distinct services that form part of a single performance obligation. As such, we have elected the optional exemptions related to the as-invoiced practical expedient and the variable consideration allocation exception whereby the disclosure of the amount of transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations is not required.\nWe have applied the as-invoiced practical expedient and the variable consideration allocation exception to contracts with performance obligations that have an average remaining duration of less than a year.\nRevenue is recognized upon the collection of defaulted loan and debt payments. Loan rehabilitation revenue is recognized when the rehabilitated loans are sold (funded) by clients. Incentive revenue is recognized upon receipt of official notification of incentive award from customers. Under our MSP CRC contract with CMS, we recognize revenues when insurance companies or other responsible parties remit payment to reimburse CMS for claims for which they are responsible, and the remittance has been applied in the CMS database. Under our RAC contracts with CMS, we recognize revenues when the healthcare provider has paid CMS for a claim or has agreed to an offset against other claims by the provider. Under other healthcare contracts, we may recognize revenue upon delivering the results of claims audits, when sufficient reliable information is available to us for estimating the variable consideration earned, as it is a reasonable measure of our progress toward complete satisfaction of our performance obligation.\nHealthcare providers have the right to appeal a claim and may pursue additional level of appeals if the initial appeal is found in favor of CMS. We accrue an estimated liability for appeals at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the amount of revenue probable of being returned to CMS following successful appeal based on historical data and other trends relating to such appeals. In addition, if our estimate of liability for appeals with respect to revenues recognized during a prior period changes, we increase or decrease the estimated liability for appeals in the current period.\nThis estimated liability for appeals is an offset to revenues on our income statement. Resolution of appeals can take a very long time to resolve and there is a significant backlog in the system for resolving appeals, as over the course of our existing RAC contract, healthcare providers have increased their pursuit of appeals beyond the first and second levels of appeal to the third level of appeal, where cases are heard by administrative law judges, or ALJs. In our experience, decisions at the third level of appeal are the least favorable as ALJs exercise greater discretion and there is less predictability in the ALJ decisions as compared to appeals at the first or second levels. This increase of ALJ appeals and backlog of claims at the third level of appeal is the primary reason our total estimated liability for appeals (consisting of the estimated liability for appeals plus the contra-accounts-receivable estimated allowance for appeals) has historically remained at a consistent level despite decreasing revenue from CMS. On January 31, 2018, CMS issued to us their final Letter of Demand which reconciled all outstanding payables to CMS for the old Region A contract. Accordingly, we released an aggregate of approximately $27.8 million and $0.6 million of the estimated liability for appeals and the Net payable to client balances, during the first quarter and third quarter of 2018, respectively. This increased first quarter 2018 revenue by $27.8 million and third quarter revenue by $0.6 million. In conjunction with the release, we also derecognized approximately $9.0 million of prepaid expenses and other current assets, with a charge to other operating expenses, reflecting accrued receivables associated with amounts due to us from our subcontractors for decided and yet-to-be decided appeals. As a result, we no longer have any estimated liability for appeals relating to our first CMS contract. The Company has accrued $0.2 million of additional estimated liability for appeals related to other healthcare contracts at December 31, 2018, which represents our best estimate of the probable amount of losses related to appeals of claims for which commissions were previously collected. To the extent that required payments by us related to successful appeals exceed the amount accrued, revenues in the applicable period would be reduced by the amount of the excess.\nWe determined that we do not have any costs related to obtaining or fulfilling a contract that are recoverable and as such, these contract costs are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair value assigned to the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We perform our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill fair value is less than its carrying amount in November of each year to allow us additional time to evaluate our assessment prior to reporting its results. We performed a quantitative impairment assessment of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill fair value is less than its carrying amount as of November 30, 2018, and concluded that there was no need to impair goodwill.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table represents our historical operating results for the periods presented:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>96,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expense\n</td> <td>58,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n</td> <td>2,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>157,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(1,797\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(4,699\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,972\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,273\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>(6,468\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,054\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,586\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>1,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,325\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,867\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(216\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,010\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,729\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,719\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were $155.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $23.6 million or 18%, compared to total revenues of $132.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nStudent lending revenues were $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $27.8 million, or 29%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily a result of the wind down relating to Great Lakes and decrease in the number of borrowers that are participating in the rehabilitation programs with our GA clients.\nHealthcare revenues were $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $46.0 million, or 460%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in healthcare revenues attributable to our CMS RAC contract and MSP CRC was $40.4 million, and the increase attributable to our revenues from our commercial healthcare clients was $5.5 million in 2018. This increase was due primarily to the release of $28.4 million of the estimated liability for appeals and the net payable to client balances for the old CMS Region A contract, and the ramp up of our CMS MSP CRC contract and other contracts with our commercial healthcare customers.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits expense was $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $14.0 million, or 17%, compared to salaries and benefits expense of $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to increased headcount during 2018 in anticipation of ramp up of activity related to new clients and contracts and the acquisition of Premiere.\nOther Operating Expense\nOther operating expense was $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.5 million, or 4%, compared to other operating expense of $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to a $7.1 million derecognition of subcontractor receivable associated with the termination of the 2009 CMS Region A contract, a $1.9 million allowance for doubtful accounts against subcontractor receivable and higher rent, utilities and maintenance expenses which were offset by lower third party collection fees.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.9 million, compared to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. An impairment expense of $3.0 million was recognized in 2018 relating to the write-off of the Great Lakes customer relationship intangible asset. The impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 million that was recognized in 2017 relates to the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets in one of our subsidiaries, Performant Europe Ltd., due to the Company's decision to wind down activity in this business in 2017.\nLoss from Operations\nAs a result of the factors described above, loss from operations was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to loss from operations of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $5.3 million, or 75%.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of 33%. Interest expense decreased due to a lower annual average principal debt balance and lower interest rates under our current Credit Agreement in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax provision was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective income tax rate changed to (23%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 9% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily driven by the current year losses for which no benefit is being recognized due to the valuation allowance.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the factors described above, net loss was $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which represents a decrease of $4.7 million compared to net loss of $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table presents our historical operating results for the periods presented:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,311\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>82,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expense\n</td> <td>55,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n</td> <td>1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>139,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(7,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(6,972\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,897\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(925\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>(14,054\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,823\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,769\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>(1,325\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,370\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Loss\n</td> <td>(12,729\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,453\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were $132.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $9.3 million or 7%, compared to total revenues of $141.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is due to a decline in revenues in both our student lending and healthcare markets.\nStudent lending revenues were $94.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $15.3 million, or 14%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily a result of the expiration of the Department of Education contract in April 2015 and subsequent wind down, partially offset by an increase in revenue as a result of an increase in the number of borrowers that are participating in the rehabilitation programs with our Guaranty Agency clients.\nHealthcare revenues were $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $1.4 million, or 12%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was due primarily to the wind down of our first RAC contract during 2017, offset by an approximately $2.9 million increase in revenues from commercial healthcare customers.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits expense was $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $3.3 million, or 4%, compared to salaries and benefits expense of $78.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to increased headcount during 2017 in anticipation of ramp up of activity related to new clients and contracts.\nOther Operating Expense\nOther operating expense was $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.9 million, or 2%, compared to other operating expense of $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to higher third party collection fees.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $14.4 million, compared to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 million that was recognized in 2017 relates to the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets in one of our subsidiaries, Performant Europe Ltd., due to the Company's decision to wind down activity in this business in 2017. In 2016, we wrote off of $15.4 million related to the Department of Education customer relationship intangible after the Department of Education announced in December 2016 that we would not be a recipient of the new contract awards.\nLoss from Operations\nAs a result of the factors described above, loss from operations was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to loss from operations of $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a decrease of $0.8 million, or 11%.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a decrease of 12%. Interest expense decreased due to repayments of principal under our prior credit agreement resulting in a lower outstanding balance in 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax benefit was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 28% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a loss from operations in 2017 for which the tax benefit is not recognized due to the valuation allowance and the accrued state income tax expense related to income from operations that is taxed in separate state jurisdictions.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the factors described above, net loss was $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents an increase of $1.3 million compared to net loss of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash flows from operations. Cash and cash equivalents, which excludes restricted cash, totaled $5.5 million as of December 31, 2018. Due to our operating cash flows and our existing cash and cash equivalents and our ability to restructure both our variable and fixed expenses, we believe that we have the ability to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future.\nThe $16.3 million decrease in the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 compared with December 31, 2017 was primarily due to our net loss, the principal and interest payments on our long-term debt and delay in timing of cash inflows from trade receivables, which was offset by delayed draw of $4.0 million of loan proceeds in 2018.\nThe following table presents information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,149\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(5,360\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,259\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,866\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>1,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40,637\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activities\nOperating activities used $12.1 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $15.1 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease included a net loss of $8.0 million in 2018, an increase in trade receivables of $6.7 million, and a decrease in the net\npayable to client of $2.9 million, which was partially offset by various working capital fluctuations such as a decrease in our income tax receivable of $6.7 million.\nOperating activities provided $3.0 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $14.8 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease included a net loss of $12.7 million in 2017 and was partially offset by various working capital fluctuations such as an increase in our income tax receivable of $4.8 million, an increase in trade receivables of $1.0 million and a decrease in other current liabilities of $1.1 million.\nOperating activities provided $17.8 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $1.6 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our net loss of $11.5 million in 2016 includes $15.4 million of non-cash customer-relationship impairment expense. Taking account of this non-cash expense, operating activities during 2016 provided cash at a level similar to 2015. Additional operating cash was provided by a reduction in trade receivables of $6.5 million. These items were partially offset by various working capital fluctuations such as an increase in our income tax receivable of $2.0 million and a decrease in net payable to client of $1.3 million.\nCash flows from investing activities\nInvesting activities resulted in cash outflow of $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and was primarily for capital expenditures related to information technology, hardware, data storage and security enhancements to our operating software offset by the working capital related to the acquisition of Premiere.\nInvesting activities resulted in cash outflow of $7.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and was primarily for capital expenditures related to information technology, hardware, data storage and security enhancements to our operating software.\nInvesting activities resulted in cash outflow of $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 and was primarily for capital expenditures related to information technology, data storage, hardware, telecommunication systems and security enhancements to our proprietary software.\nCash flows from financing activities\nCash provided from financing activities of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to additional borrowings on notes payable of $4.0 million, offset by the repayment of principal on outstanding debt of $2.2 million.\nCash used in financing activities of $12.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the repayment of principal on outstanding debt and other contractual obligations of $55.5 million, additional borrowings on notes payable of $44.0 million, and $0.9 million in debt issuance costs for amendments to our credit agreement.\nCash used in financing activities of $40.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the repayment of principal on outstanding debt and other contractual obligations of $39.1 million, and $1.2 million in debt issuance costs for amendments to our credit agreement.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash included in current assets on our consolidated balance sheet was $1.8 million as of December 31, 2018, and $1.8 million as of December 31, 2017. In November 2017, the Company deposited $1.8 million in restricted cash as collateral for new letters of credit issued to replace letters of credit terminated under our prior credit agreement.\nLong-term Debt\nOn August 7, 2017, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Performant Business Services, Inc. (the \"Borrower\"), entered into a credit agreement with ECMC Group, Inc. (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d). Before the amendment described below, the Credit Agreement provided for a term loan facility in the initial amount of $44 million (the Initial Term Loan\u201d) and for up to $15 million of additional term loans ( Additional Term Loans\u201d; and together with the Initial Term Loan, the Loans\u201d) which original Additional Term Loans were initially able to be drawn until the second anniversary of the funding of the Initial Term Loans, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. On August 11, 2017, the Initial Term Loan was advanced (the \"Closing Date\") and the proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding amounts under our prior credit agreement with Madison Capital Funding LLC as administrative agent (\"the Prior Credit Agreement\"). On August 31, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement to among other things (i) extend the maturity date of the Initial Term Loan and\nany Additional Term Loans by one year to August 2021, (ii) expand the Additional Term Loans commitment from $15 million to $25 million, (iii) extend the period during which the Additional Term Loans can be borrowed by one year to August 2020, and (iv) relieve the Borrower from its obligation to comply with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement during the six fiscal quarters following the Premiere acquisition. On October 15, 2018, the Company borrowed $4 million of the $25 million available as Additional Term Loans under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, $45.8 million was outstanding under the Credit Agreement. On March 21, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement to among other things relieve the Borrower from its obligation to comply with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement until the quarter ending June 30, 2020.\nWe have the option to extend the maturity of the Loans for two additional one year periods, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. The Loans bear interest at the one-month LIBOR rate (subject to a 1% per annum floor) plus a margin which may vary from 5.5% per annum to 10.0% per annum based on our total debt to EBITDA ratio. Our annual interest rate at December 31, 2018, was 8.0%, and at December 31, 2017 was 8.6%. We are required to pay 5% of the original principal balance of the Loans annually in quarterly installments and to make mandatory prepayments of the Loans with a percentage of our excess cash flow which may vary between 75% and 0% depending on our total debt to EBITDA ratio and from the net cash proceeds of certain asset dispositions and debt not otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement, in each case, subject to the lender's right to decline to receive such payments. The Loans may be voluntarily prepaid at any time, together with a prepayment premium of 1% for all voluntary prepayments prior to August 11, 2019.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants which are not effective until the quarter ending June 30, 2020, at which point, we will be required to (1) achieve a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 through December 31, 2020, 1.25 to 1.0 through June 30, 2021, and 1.25 to 1.0 through June 30, 2022 if the maturity date of the Loans is extended until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (2) maintain a maximum total debt to EBITDA ratio of 6.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants that restrict the Company and its subsidiaries' ability to incur certain types or amounts of indebtedness, incur liens on certain assets, make material changes in corporate structure or the nature of its business, dispose of material assets, engage in a change in control transaction, make certain foreign investments, enter into certain restrictive agreements, or engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also contains various customary events of default, including with respect to change of control of the Company or its ownership of the Borrower.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our United States domestic subsidiaries' assets and are guaranteed by the Company and its United States domestic subsidiaries, other than the Borrower.\nAs a result of our entry into our Credit Agreement, and the repayment of all amounts owed under our Prior Credit Agreement, we wrote off debt issuance costs related to our Prior Credit Agreement of approximately $1.0 million in August 2017.\nIn consideration for, and concurrently with, the extension of the Initial Term Loan in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, we issued a warrant to the lender to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,863,326 shares of the Company's common stock (representing approximately up to 7.5% of our diluted common stock as calculated using the treasury stock\u201d method as defined under U.S. GAAP for the most recent fiscal quarter, with an exercise price of $1.92 per share (the \"Exercise Price\")). In connection with the October 15, 2018 Additional Term Loan borrowing of $4 million, we were required to, and did, issue a warrant to the lender to purchase an aggregate of 309,066 shares of the Company's common stock at the same Exercise Price of $1.92 per share. Upon any further borrowing of the Additional Term Loans, we will be required to issue additional warrants at the same Exercise Price to purchase up to an aggregate of 77,267 additional shares of common stock (which represents approximately 0.15% of our diluted common stock calculated using the treasury stock\u201d method as defined under U.S. GAAP for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017) for each $1.0 million of such Additional Term Loans. Similarly, upon our election to extend the maturity of the Loans for additional one year periods, we will be required to issue additional warrants at the same Exercise Price to purchase up to an aggregate of 515,110 additional shares of common stock for the first year's extension, and to purchase up to an aggregate of 772,665 additional shares of common stock for the second year's extension (which represent approximately 1.0% and 1.5% of our diluted common stock for the first and second years, respectively, calculated using the treasury stock\u201d method as defined under U.S. GAAP for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017).\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\nThan\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\nThan\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Payments\n</td> <td>8,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>13,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations\n</td> <td>7,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in the table below and within this report adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided a reconciliation below of adjusted EBITDA to net income and adjusted net income to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income in this report because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income provide useful information to investors and analysts in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nOur use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe provide technology-enabled audit, recovery, outsource services, and related analytics services in the United States. Our services help identify improper payments, and in some markets, restructure and recover delinquent or defaulted assets and improper payments for both government and private clients in a broad range of markets. Our clients typically operate in complex and regulated environments and outsource their audit and recovery needs in order to reduce losses on billions of dollars of defaulted student loans, improper healthcare payments and delinquent state and federal tax and federal treasury and other receivables. We also provide complex outsource services for clients across our various markets, where we handle many or all aspects of our clients' audit and recovery processes.\nOur revenue model is generally success-based as we earn fees on the aggregate correct audits and/or amount of funds that we enable our clients to recover. Our services do not require any significant upfront investments by our clients and offer\nour clients the opportunity to recover significant funds otherwise lost. Because our model is based upon the success of our efforts, our business objectives are aligned with those of our clients and we are generally not reliant on their spending budgets. Furthermore, our business model does not require significant capital as we do not purchase loans or obligations.\nSources of Revenues\nWe derive our revenues from services for clients in a variety of different markets. These markets include our two largest markets, student lending and healthcare, as well as our other markets which include but are not limited to delinquent state and federal taxes and federal treasury and other receivables.\n\n (1) Includes $28.4 million related to the termination of the 2009 CMS Region A contract \n (2) Represents outsource services, tax, and IRS  Student Lending\nOur revenues from the student lending market are contract-based and consist primarily of contingency fees based on a specified percentage of the amount we enable our clients to recover. Our contingency fee percentage for a particular recovery depends on the type of recovery facilitated. Our clients in the student loan recovery market mainly consist of several of the largest guaranty agencies, or GAs. We believe the size and the composition of our student loan inventory at any point provides us with a significant degree of revenue visibility for our student loan revenues. Based on data compiled from over two decades of experience with the recovery of defaulted student loans, at the time we receive a placement of student loans, we are able to make a reasonably accurate estimate of the recovery outcomes likely to be derived from such placement and the revenues we are likely able to generate based on the anticipated recovery outcomes.\nOur key metric in evaluating our student lending business is Placement Volume. Our Placement Volume represents the dollar volume of defaulted student loans first placed with us during the specified period by public and private clients for recovery. Placement Volume allows us to measure and track trends in the amount of inventory our clients in the student lending market are placing with us during any period. The revenues associated with the recovery of a portion of these loans may be recognized in subsequent accounting periods, which assists management in estimating future revenues and in allocating resources necessary to address current Placement Volumes. The following table shows our Placement Volume for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, showing separately the Placement Volume associated with student loans held by Great Lakes for which we served as the primary recovery contractor until September 2017 and since that time as a subcontractor to Navient, the primary servicer of the Great Lakes portfolio.\n\nThere are five potential outcomes to the student loan recovery process from which we generate revenues. These outcomes include: full repayment, recurring payments, rehabilitation, loan restructuring and wage garnishment. Of these five potential outcomes, our ability to rehabilitate defaulted student loans is the most significant component of our revenues in this market. Generally, a loan is considered successfully rehabilitated after the student loan borrower has made nine consecutive qualifying monthly payments and our client has notified us that it is recalling the loan. Once we have structured and implemented a repayment program for a defaulted borrower, we (i) earn a percentage of each periodic payment collected up to and including the final periodic payment prior to the loan being considered rehabilitated\u201d by our clients, and (ii) if the loan is rehabilitated,\u201d then we are paid a one-time percentage of the total amount of the remaining unpaid balance for each rehabilitated loan. The fees we are paid vary by recovery outcome as well as by contract. For non-government-supported student loans we are generally only paid contingency fees on two outcomes: full repayment or recurring repayments. The table below describes our typical fee structure for each of these five outcomes.\nStudent Loan Recovery Outcomes\n\nOur revenues from student lending were approximately 29% lower in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily as a result of the change in our relationship with Great Lakes, for which we acted as the primary recovery contractor until September 2017 and as a subcontractor on a portion of the overall portfolio since that time.\nHealthcare\nWe derive revenues from both commercial and government clients in the healthcare market. Revenues earned under these contracts are driven by auditing, identifying, and sometimes recovering improperly paid claims through both automated and manual review of such claims. We are paid contingency fees by our clients based on a percentage of the dollar amount of improper claims recovered as a result of our efforts. The revenues we recognize are net of our estimate of claims that we believe will be overturned by appeal following payment by the provider.\nOn October 5, 2017, we announced that we were awarded the MSP CRC contract by the CMS. Under this agreement, we are responsible for identifying and recovering payments in situations where Medicare should not be the primary payer of healthcare claims because a beneficiary has other forms of insurance coverage, such as through an employer group health plan or certain other payers.\nOn October 26, 2016, CMS awarded new RAC contracts and we received RAC contracts for audit Regions 1 and 5. The RAC contract award for Region 1 allows us to continue our audit of payments under Medicare's Part A and Part B for all provider types other than DMEPOS and home health and hospice within an 11 state region in the Northeast and Midwest. The Region 5 RAC contract provides for the post-payment review of DMEPOS and home health and hospice claims nationally. While audit and recovery activity under the new contracts commenced in April 2017, the scope of audit permitted by CMS under the new RAC contracts has been limited to 0.5% of claims. We do not expect to recognize significant revenues from the newly awarded RAC contracts until the percentage of claims we are able to audit increases from the current 0.5% of the claims.\nWe accrue an estimated liability for appeals based on the amount of commissions received which are subject to appeal and which we estimate are probable of being returned to providers following successful appeal. The $18.5 million balance as of December 31, 2017, represented our best estimate of the probable amount that we may be required to refund related to appeals of claims for which commissions were previously collected. The term of our first Medicare Recovery Audit Contract with CMS, for Region A, expired on January 31, 2018. Our estimates for this appeals liability are based on our historical experience\nwith the Medicare RAC appeal process. As the term of the original contract expired, CMS issued a letter to us on January 2, 2018, stating that Performant will no longer be obligated to support the appeals process or maintain an appeal reserve after the January 31, 2018 contract termination date. In addition to the estimated liability for appeals, we also maintained a separate net payable to client liability for appeals decisions which had been decided, but not yet refunded to CMS. On January 31, 2018, CMS issued to us their final Letter of Demand which reconciled all outstanding payables to CMS for the old Region A contract. Accordingly, we released an aggregate of approximately $27.8 million and $0.6 million of the estimated liability for appeals and the net payable to client balances, during the first quarter and third quarter of 2018, respectively. This increased first quarter 2018 revenue by $27.8 million and third quarter revenue by $0.6 million. In conjunction with the release, we also derecognized approximately $9.0 million of prepaid expenses and other current assets, with a charge to other operating expenses, reflecting accrued receivables associated with amounts due to us from our subcontractors for decided and yet-to-be decided appeals. As a result, we no longer have any estimated liability for appeals relating to our first CMS contract. We have accrued $0.2 million of additional estimated liability for appeals related to other healthcare contracts at December 31, 2018.\nFor our commercial healthcare business, our business strategy is focused on utilizing our technology-enabled services platform to provide audit, recovery and analytical services for private healthcare payers. We have entered into contracts with several private payers, although these contracts are in the early stage of implementation. Revenues from our commercial healthcare clients were $14.1 million for 2018 compared to revenues of $8.5 million that we earned from our commercial healthcare clients in 2017.\nOther\nWe also derive revenues from the recovery of delinquent state and federal taxes, and federal treasury and other receivables, default aversion and/or first party call center services for certain clients and the licensing of hosted technology solutions to certain clients. For our hosted technology services, we license our system and integrate our technology into our clients' operations, for which we are paid a licensing fee. Our revenues for these services include contingency fees, fees based on dedicated headcount to our clients and hosted technology licensing fees.\nCosts and Expenses\nWe generally report two categories of operating expenses: salaries and benefits and other operating expense. Salaries and benefits expenses consist primarily of salaries and performance incentives paid and benefits provided to our employees. Other operating expense includes expenses related to our use of subcontractors, other production related expenses, including costs associated with data processing, retrieval of medical records, printing and mailing services, amortization and other outside services, as well as general corporate and administrative expenses.\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Results\nOur results of operations are influenced by a number of factors, including allocation of placement volume, claim recovery volume, contingency fees, regulatory matters, client retention and macroeconomic factors.\nAllocation of Placement Volume\nOur clients have the right to unilaterally set and increase or reduce the volume of defaulted student loans or other receivables that we service at any given time. In addition, many of our recovery contracts for student loans and other receivables are not exclusive, with our clients retaining multiple service providers to service portions of their portfolios. Accordingly, the number of delinquent student loans or other receivables that are placed with us may vary from time to time, which may have a significant effect on the amount and timing of our revenues. We believe the major factors that influence the number of placements we receive from our clients in the student loan market include our performance under our existing contracts and our ability to perform well against competitors for a particular client. To the extent that we perform well under our existing contracts and differentiate our services from those of our competitors, we may receive a relatively greater number of placements under these existing contracts and may improve our ability to obtain future contracts from these clients and other potential clients. Further, delays in placement volume, as well as acceleration of placement volume, from any of our large clients may cause our revenues and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter.\nTypically, we are able to anticipate with reasonable accuracy the timing and volume of placements of defaulted student loans and other receivables based on historical patterns and regular communication with our clients. Occasionally, however, placements are delayed due to factors outside of our control.\nContingency Fees\nOur revenues consist primarily of contract-based contingency fees. The contingency fee percentages that we earn are set by our clients or agreed upon during the bid process and may change from time to time either under the terms of existing contracts or pursuant to the terms of contract renewals.\nRegulatory Matters\nEach of the markets which we serve is highly regulated. Accordingly, changes in regulations that affect the types of loans, receivables and claims that we are able to service or the manner in which any such delinquent loans, receivables and claims can be recovered will affect our revenues and results of operations. For example, the passage of the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, or SAFRA, in 2010 had the effect of transferring the origination of all government-supported student loans to the Department of Education, thereby ending all student loan originations guaranteed by the GAs. Loans guaranteed by the GAs represented approximately 70% of government-supported student loans originated in 2009. While the GAs will continue to service existing outstanding student loans for years to come, this legislation means that there will be no further growth in student loans held by GAs. Further, we are seeing a larger amount of defaulted student loans in our GA client portfolios that have been previously rehabilitated and by regulation are not subject to rehabilitation for a second time. In addition, our entry into the healthcare market was facilitated by passage of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which mandated CMS to contract with private firms to audit Medicare claims in an effort to increase the recovery of improper Medicare payments. Any changes to the regulations that affect the student loan industry or the recovery of defaulted student loans or the Medicare program generally or the audit and recovery of Medicare claims could have a significant impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nClient Contract Cancellation\nSubstantially all of our contracts entitle our clients to unilaterally terminate their contractual relationship with us at any time without penalty. If we lose one or more of our significant clients, including if one of our significant clients is consolidated by an entity that does not use our services, if the terms of compensation for our services change or if there is a reduction in the level of placements provided by any of these clients, our revenues could decline.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nCertain macroeconomic factors influence our business and results of operations. These include the increasing volume of student loan originations in the U.S. as a result of increased tuition costs and student enrollment, the default rate of student loan borrowers, the growth in Medicare expenditures resulting from increasing healthcare costs, as well as the fiscal budget tightening of federal, state and local governments as a result of general economic weakness and lower tax revenues.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period-to-period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU that amends the FASB ASC by creating a new Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We adopted Topic 606 as of January 1, 2018, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition. We applied Topic 606 retrospectively for all reporting periods presented before January 1, 2018, the date of the initial application. There was no impact of adopting Topic 606 on our 2017 and 2016 consolidated financial statements.\nWe derive our revenues primarily from providing recovery services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n \u2022 Identification of the contract with a customer \n \u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract \n \u2022 Determination of the transaction price \n \u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract \n \u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied  We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nOur contracts generally contain a single performance obligation, delivered over time as a series of services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to a client, as the promise to transfer the individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. We determine the standalone selling prices by taking into consideration the value of the services being provided, the client type and how similar services are priced in other contracts on a standalone basis.\nOur contracts are composed primarily of variable consideration. Fees earned under our recovery service contracts consist primarily of contingency fees based on a specified percentage of the amount we enable our clients to recover. The contingency fee percentage for a particular recovery depends on the type of recovery or claim facilitated. In certain contracts we can earn additional performance-based consideration determined based on its performance relative to a client's other contractors providing similar services.\nRevenue from contingency fees earned upon recovery of funds is generally recognized as amounts are invoiced based on either the \u2018as-invoiced' practical expedient when such amounts reflect the value of the services completed to-date, or an output metric used to measure progress of the satisfaction of its performance obligation. We estimate any performance-based variable consideration and recognizes such revenue over the performance period only if it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Under certain contracts, consideration can include periodic performance-based bonuses which can be awarded based on our performance under the specific contract. These performance-based awards are considered variable and may be constrained by us until there is not a risk of a material reversal.\nFor contracts that contain a refund right, these amounts are considered variable consideration, and we estimate our refund liability for each claim and recognizes revenue net of such estimate.\nWe generally either apply the as-invoiced practical expedient where our right to consideration corresponds directly to our right to invoice our clients, or the variable consideration allocation exception where the variable consideration is attributable to one or more, but not all, of the services promised in a series of distinct services that form part of a single performance obligation. As such, we have elected the optional exemptions related to the as-invoiced practical expedient and the variable consideration allocation exception whereby the disclosure of the amount of transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations is not required.\nWe have applied the as-invoiced practical expedient and the variable consideration allocation exception to contracts with performance obligations that have an average remaining duration of less than a year.\nRevenue is recognized upon the collection of defaulted loan and debt payments. Loan rehabilitation revenue is recognized when the rehabilitated loans are sold (funded) by clients. Incentive revenue is recognized upon receipt of official notification of incentive award from customers. Under our MSP CRC contract with CMS, we recognize revenues when insurance companies or other responsible parties remit payment to reimburse CMS for claims for which they are responsible, and the remittance has been applied in the CMS database. Under our RAC contracts with CMS, we recognize revenues when the healthcare provider has paid CMS for a claim or has agreed to an offset against other claims by the provider. Under other healthcare contracts, we may recognize revenue upon delivering the results of claims audits, when sufficient reliable information is available to us for estimating the variable consideration earned, as it is a reasonable measure of our progress toward complete satisfaction of our performance obligation.\nHealthcare providers have the right to appeal a claim and may pursue additional level of appeals if the initial appeal is found in favor of CMS. We accrue an estimated liability for appeals at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the amount of revenue probable of being returned to CMS following successful appeal based on historical data and other trends relating to such appeals. In addition, if our estimate of liability for appeals with respect to revenues recognized during a prior period changes, we increase or decrease the estimated liability for appeals in the current period.\nThis estimated liability for appeals is an offset to revenues on our income statement. Resolution of appeals can take a very long time to resolve and there is a significant backlog in the system for resolving appeals, as over the course of our existing RAC contract, healthcare providers have increased their pursuit of appeals beyond the first and second levels of appeal to the third level of appeal, where cases are heard by administrative law judges, or ALJs. In our experience, decisions at the third level of appeal are the least favorable as ALJs exercise greater discretion and there is less predictability in the ALJ decisions as compared to appeals at the first or second levels. This increase of ALJ appeals and backlog of claims at the third level of appeal is the primary reason our total estimated liability for appeals (consisting of the estimated liability for appeals plus the contra-accounts-receivable estimated allowance for appeals) has historically remained at a consistent level despite decreasing revenue from CMS. On January 31, 2018, CMS issued to us their final Letter of Demand which reconciled all outstanding payables to CMS for the old Region A contract. Accordingly, we released an aggregate of approximately $27.8 million and $0.6 million of the estimated liability for appeals and the Net payable to client balances, during the first quarter and third quarter of 2018, respectively. This increased first quarter 2018 revenue by $27.8 million and third quarter revenue by $0.6 million. In conjunction with the release, we also derecognized approximately $9.0 million of prepaid expenses and other current assets, with a charge to other operating expenses, reflecting accrued receivables associated with amounts due to us from our subcontractors for decided and yet-to-be decided appeals. As a result, we no longer have any estimated liability for appeals relating to our first CMS contract. The Company has accrued $0.2 million of additional estimated liability for appeals related to other healthcare contracts at December 31, 2018, which represents our best estimate of the probable amount of losses related to appeals of claims for which commissions were previously collected. To the extent that required payments by us related to successful appeals exceed the amount accrued, revenues in the applicable period would be reduced by the amount of the excess.\nWe determined that we do not have any costs related to obtaining or fulfilling a contract that are recoverable and as such, these contract costs are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair value assigned to the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We perform our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill fair value is less than its carrying amount in November of each year to allow us additional time to evaluate our assessment prior to reporting its results. We performed a quantitative impairment assessment of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill fair value is less than its carrying amount as of November 30, 2018, and concluded that there was no need to impair goodwill.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table represents our historical operating results for the periods presented:\n\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were $155.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $23.6 million or 18%, compared to total revenues of $132.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nStudent lending revenues were $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $27.8 million, or 29%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily a result of the wind down relating to Great Lakes and decrease in the number of borrowers that are participating in the rehabilitation programs with our GA clients.\nHealthcare revenues were $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $46.0 million, or 460%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in healthcare revenues attributable to our CMS RAC contract and MSP CRC was $40.4 million, and the increase attributable to our revenues from our commercial healthcare clients was $5.5 million in 2018. This increase was due primarily to the release of $28.4 million of the estimated liability for appeals and the net payable to client balances for the old CMS Region A contract, and the ramp up of our CMS MSP CRC contract and other contracts with our commercial healthcare customers.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits expense was $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $14.0 million, or 17%, compared to salaries and benefits expense of $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to increased headcount during 2018 in anticipation of ramp up of activity related to new clients and contracts and the acquisition of Premiere.\nOther Operating Expense\nOther operating expense was $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.5 million, or 4%, compared to other operating expense of $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to a $7.1 million derecognition of subcontractor receivable associated with the termination of the 2009 CMS Region A contract, a $1.9 million allowance for doubtful accounts against subcontractor receivable and higher rent, utilities and maintenance expenses which were offset by lower third party collection fees.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.9 million, compared to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. An impairment expense of $3.0 million was recognized in 2018 relating to the write-off of the Great Lakes customer relationship intangible asset. The impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 million that was recognized in 2017 relates to the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets in one of our subsidiaries, Performant Europe Ltd., due to the Company's decision to wind down activity in this business in 2017.\nLoss from Operations\nAs a result of the factors described above, loss from operations was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to loss from operations of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $5.3 million, or 75%.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of 33%. Interest expense decreased due to a lower annual average principal debt balance and lower interest rates under our current Credit Agreement in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax provision was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective income tax rate changed to (23%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 9% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily driven by the current year losses for which no benefit is being recognized due to the valuation allowance.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the factors described above, net loss was $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which represents a decrease of $4.7 million compared to net loss of $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table presents our historical operating results for the periods presented:\n\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were $132.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $9.3 million or 7%, compared to total revenues of $141.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is due to a decline in revenues in both our student lending and healthcare markets.\nStudent lending revenues were $94.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $15.3 million, or 14%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily a result of the expiration of the Department of Education contract in April 2015 and subsequent wind down, partially offset by an increase in revenue as a result of an increase in the number of borrowers that are participating in the rehabilitation programs with our Guaranty Agency clients.\nHealthcare revenues were $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $1.4 million, or 12%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was due primarily to the wind down of our first RAC contract during 2017, offset by an approximately $2.9 million increase in revenues from commercial healthcare customers.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits expense was $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $3.3 million, or 4%, compared to salaries and benefits expense of $78.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to increased headcount during 2017 in anticipation of ramp up of activity related to new clients and contracts.\nOther Operating Expense\nOther operating expense was $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.9 million, or 2%, compared to other operating expense of $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to higher third party collection fees.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $14.4 million, compared to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 million that was recognized in 2017 relates to the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets in one of our subsidiaries, Performant Europe Ltd., due to the Company's decision to wind down activity in this business in 2017. In 2016, we wrote off of $15.4 million related to the Department of Education customer relationship intangible after the Department of Education announced in December 2016 that we would not be a recipient of the new contract awards.\nLoss from Operations\nAs a result of the factors described above, loss from operations was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to loss from operations of $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a decrease of $0.8 million, or 11%.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a decrease of 12%. Interest expense decreased due to repayments of principal under our prior credit agreement resulting in a lower outstanding balance in 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax benefit was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 28% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a loss from operations in 2017 for which the tax benefit is not recognized due to the valuation allowance and the accrued state income tax expense related to income from operations that is taxed in separate state jurisdictions.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the factors described above, net loss was $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents an increase of $1.3 million compared to net loss of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash flows from operations. Cash and cash equivalents, which excludes restricted cash, totaled $5.5 million as of December 31, 2018. Due to our operating cash flows and our existing cash and cash equivalents and our ability to restructure both our variable and fixed expenses, we believe that we have the ability to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future.\nThe $16.3 million decrease in the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 compared with December 31, 2017 was primarily due to our net loss, the principal and interest payments on our long-term debt and delay in timing of cash inflows from trade receivables, which was offset by delayed draw of $4.0 million of loan proceeds in 2018.\nThe following table presents information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\nCash flows from operating activities\nOperating activities used $12.1 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $15.1 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease included a net loss of $8.0 million in 2018, an increase in trade receivables of $6.7 million, and a decrease in the net\npayable to client of $2.9 million, which was partially offset by various working capital fluctuations such as a decrease in our income tax receivable of $6.7 million.\nOperating activities provided $3.0 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $14.8 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease included a net loss of $12.7 million in 2017 and was partially offset by various working capital fluctuations such as an increase in our income tax receivable of $4.8 million, an increase in trade receivables of $1.0 million and a decrease in other current liabilities of $1.1 million.\nOperating activities provided $17.8 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $1.6 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our net loss of $11.5 million in 2016 includes $15.4 million of non-cash customer-relationship impairment expense. Taking account of this non-cash expense, operating activities during 2016 provided cash at a level similar to 2015. Additional operating cash was provided by a reduction in trade receivables of $6.5 million. These items were partially offset by various working capital fluctuations such as an increase in our income tax receivable of $2.0 million and a decrease in net payable to client of $1.3 million.\nCash flows from investing activities\nInvesting activities resulted in cash outflow of $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and was primarily for capital expenditures related to information technology, hardware, data storage and security enhancements to our operating software offset by the working capital related to the acquisition of Premiere.\nInvesting activities resulted in cash outflow of $7.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and was primarily for capital expenditures related to information technology, hardware, data storage and security enhancements to our operating software.\nInvesting activities resulted in cash outflow of $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 and was primarily for capital expenditures related to information technology, data storage, hardware, telecommunication systems and security enhancements to our proprietary software.\nCash flows from financing activities\nCash provided from financing activities of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to additional borrowings on notes payable of $4.0 million, offset by the repayment of principal on outstanding debt of $2.2 million.\nCash used in financing activities of $12.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the repayment of principal on outstanding debt and other contractual obligations of $55.5 million, additional borrowings on notes payable of $44.0 million, and $0.9 million in debt issuance costs for amendments to our credit agreement.\nCash used in financing activities of $40.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the repayment of principal on outstanding debt and other contractual obligations of $39.1 million, and $1.2 million in debt issuance costs for amendments to our credit agreement.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash included in current assets on our consolidated balance sheet was $1.8 million as of December 31, 2018, and $1.8 million as of December 31, 2017. In November 2017, the Company deposited $1.8 million in restricted cash as collateral for new letters of credit issued to replace letters of credit terminated under our prior credit agreement.\nLong-term Debt\nOn August 7, 2017, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Performant Business Services, Inc. (the \"Borrower\"), entered into a credit agreement with ECMC Group, Inc. (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d). Before the amendment described below, the Credit Agreement provided for a term loan facility in the initial amount of $44 million (the Initial Term Loan\u201d) and for up to $15 million of additional term loans ( Additional Term Loans\u201d; and together with the Initial Term Loan, the Loans\u201d) which original Additional Term Loans were initially able to be drawn until the second anniversary of the funding of the Initial Term Loans, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. On August 11, 2017, the Initial Term Loan was advanced (the \"Closing Date\") and the proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding amounts under our prior credit agreement with Madison Capital Funding LLC as administrative agent (\"the Prior Credit Agreement\"). On August 31, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement to among other things (i) extend the maturity date of the Initial Term Loan and\nany Additional Term Loans by one year to August 2021, (ii) expand the Additional Term Loans commitment from $15 million to $25 million, (iii) extend the period during which the Additional Term Loans can be borrowed by one year to August 2020, and (iv) relieve the Borrower from its obligation to comply with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement during the six fiscal quarters following the Premiere acquisition. On October 15, 2018, the Company borrowed $4 million of the $25 million available as Additional Term Loans under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, $45.8 million was outstanding under the Credit Agreement. On March 21, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement to among other things relieve the Borrower from its obligation to comply with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement until the quarter ending June 30, 2020.\nWe have the option to extend the maturity of the Loans for two additional one year periods, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. The Loans bear interest at the one-month LIBOR rate (subject to a 1% per annum floor) plus a margin which may vary from 5.5% per annum to 10.0% per annum based on our total debt to EBITDA ratio. Our annual interest rate at December 31, 2018, was 8.0%, and at December 31, 2017 was 8.6%. We are required to pay 5% of the original principal balance of the Loans annually in quarterly installments and to make mandatory prepayments of the Loans with a percentage of our excess cash flow which may vary between 75% and 0% depending on our total debt to EBITDA ratio and from the net cash proceeds of certain asset dispositions and debt not otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement, in each case, subject to the lender's right to decline to receive such payments. The Loans may be voluntarily prepaid at any time, together with a prepayment premium of 1% for all voluntary prepayments prior to August 11, 2019.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants which are not effective until the quarter ending June 30, 2020, at which point, we will be required to (1) achieve a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 through December 31, 2020, 1.25 to 1.0 through June 30, 2021, and 1.25 to 1.0 through June 30, 2022 if the maturity date of the Loans is extended until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (2) maintain a maximum total debt to EBITDA ratio of 6.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants that restrict the Company and its subsidiaries' ability to incur certain types or amounts of indebtedness, incur liens on certain assets, make material changes in corporate structure or the nature of its business, dispose of material assets, engage in a change in control transaction, make certain foreign investments, enter into certain restrictive agreements, or engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also contains various customary events of default, including with respect to change of control of the Company or its ownership of the Borrower.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our United States domestic subsidiaries' assets and are guaranteed by the Company and its United States domestic subsidiaries, other than the Borrower.\nAs a result of our entry into our Credit Agreement, and the repayment of all amounts owed under our Prior Credit Agreement, we wrote off debt issuance costs related to our Prior Credit Agreement of approximately $1.0 million in August 2017.\nIn consideration for, and concurrently with, the extension of the Initial Term Loan in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, we issued a warrant to the lender to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,863,326 shares of the Company's common stock (representing approximately up to 7.5% of our diluted common stock as calculated using the treasury stock\u201d method as defined under U.S. GAAP for the most recent fiscal quarter, with an exercise price of $1.92 per share (the \"Exercise Price\")). In connection with the October 15, 2018 Additional Term Loan borrowing of $4 million, we were required to, and did, issue a warrant to the lender to purchase an aggregate of 309,066 shares of the Company's common stock at the same Exercise Price of $1.92 per share. Upon any further borrowing of the Additional Term Loans, we will be required to issue additional warrants at the same Exercise Price to purchase up to an aggregate of 77,267 additional shares of common stock (which represents approximately 0.15% of our diluted common stock calculated using the treasury stock\u201d method as defined under U.S. GAAP for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017) for each $1.0 million of such Additional Term Loans. Similarly, upon our election to extend the maturity of the Loans for additional one year periods, we will be required to issue additional warrants at the same Exercise Price to purchase up to an aggregate of 515,110 additional shares of common stock for the first year's extension, and to purchase up to an aggregate of 772,665 additional shares of common stock for the second year's extension (which represent approximately 1.0% and 1.5% of our diluted common stock for the first and second years, respectively, calculated using the treasury stock\u201d method as defined under U.S. GAAP for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017).\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in the table below and within this report adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided a reconciliation below of adjusted EBITDA to net income and adjusted net income to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income in this report because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income provide useful information to investors and analysts in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nOur use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense on our indebtedness; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income do not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income do not reflect the impact of certain non-operating expenses resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance; and \n \u2022 other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income differently than we do, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.  Because of these limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other GAAP results.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 to actual net income (loss) for these periods:\n\n\n (1) Represents costs and expenses related to the refinancing of our indebtedness. \n (2) Represents amortization of capitalized expenses related to the acquisition of Performant by an affiliate of Parthenon Capital Partners in 2004, an acquisition in the first quarter of 2012 to enhance our analytics capabilities, and an acquisition of Premiere Credit of North America, LLC in the third quarter of 2018. \n (3) Represents amortization of capitalized financing costs related to our Credit Agreement for 2018 and 2017, and amortization of capitalized financing costs related to our Prior Credit Agreement for 2017 and 2016. \n (4) Represents intangible assets impairment charges related to Great Lakes customer relationship in 2018, impairment charges related to our Performant Europe Ltd. subsidiary in 2017, and impairment charges related to our Department of Education customer relationship due to the announcement that we would not receive a new contract award in 2016. \n (5) Represents tax adjustments assuming a marginal tax rate of 27.5% for 2018, and 40% for 2017 and 2016.  (6) Represents the net impact of the termination of our 2009 CMS Region A contract during 2018, comprised of release of an aggregate of $28.4 million of the estimated liability for appeals and the net payable to client balances into revenue, net of derecognition of $9.0 million of prepaid expenses and other current assets, with a charge to other operating expenses, reflecting accrued receivables associated with amounts due from subcontractors for decided and yet-to-be decided appeals.\n (7) Represents restructuring costs and severance and termination expenses incurred in connection with termination of employees and consultants in 2016. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" in Note 1(u) of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV - Item 15 of this report.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe provide technology-enabled audit, recovery, outsource services, and related analytics services in the United States. Our services help identify improper payments, and in some markets, restructure and recover delinquent or defaulted assets and improper payments for both government and private clients in a broad range of markets. Our clients typically operate in complex and regulated environments and outsource their audit and recovery needs in order to reduce losses on billions of dollars of defaulted student loans, improper healthcare payments and delinquent state and federal tax and federal treasury and other receivables. We also provide complex outsource services for clients across our various markets, where we handle many or all aspects of our clients' audit and recovery processes.\nOur revenue model is generally success-based as we earn fees on the aggregate correct audits and/or amount of funds that we enable our clients to recover. Our services do not require any significant upfront investments by our clients and offer\nour clients the opportunity to recover significant funds otherwise lost. Because our model is based upon the success of our efforts, our business objectives are aligned with those of our clients and we are generally not reliant on their spending budgets. Furthermore, our business model does not require significant capital as we do not purchase loans or obligations.\nSources of Revenues\nWe derive our revenues from services for clients in a variety of different markets. These markets include our two largest markets, student lending and healthcare, as well as our other markets which include but are not limited to delinquent state and federal taxes and federal treasury and other receivables.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Student Lending:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Great Lakes Higher Education Guaranty Corporation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> All Other Guaranty Agencies\n</td> <td>39,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total of Student Lending\n</td> <td>66,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> CMS RAC and MSP CRC (1)\n</td> <td>41,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Commercial\n</td> <td>14,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total of Healthcare\n</td> <td>55,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (2)\n</td> <td>33,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes $28.4 million related to the termination of the 2009 CMS Region A contract \n (2) Represents outsource services, tax, and IRS  Student Lending\nOur revenues from the student lending market are contract-based and consist primarily of contingency fees based on a specified percentage of the amount we enable our clients to recover. Our contingency fee percentage for a particular recovery depends on the type of recovery facilitated. Our clients in the student loan recovery market mainly consist of several of the largest guaranty agencies, or GAs. We believe the size and the composition of our student loan inventory at any point provides us with a significant degree of revenue visibility for our student loan revenues. Based on data compiled from over two decades of experience with the recovery of defaulted student loans, at the time we receive a placement of student loans, we are able to make a reasonably accurate estimate of the recovery outcomes likely to be derived from such placement and the revenues we are likely able to generate based on the anticipated recovery outcomes.\nOur key metric in evaluating our student lending business is Placement Volume. Our Placement Volume represents the dollar volume of defaulted student loans first placed with us during the specified period by public and private clients for recovery. Placement Volume allows us to measure and track trends in the amount of inventory our clients in the student lending market are placing with us during any period. The revenues associated with the recovery of a portion of these loans may be recognized in subsequent accounting periods, which assists management in estimating future revenues and in allocating resources necessary to address current Placement Volumes. The following table shows our Placement Volume for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, showing separately the Placement Volume associated with student loans held by Great Lakes for which we served as the primary recovery contractor until September 2017 and since that time as a subcontractor to Navient, the primary servicer of the Great Lakes portfolio.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Student Lending Placement Volume:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Great Lakes Higher Education Guaranty Corporation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>751,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>860,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> All Other Guaranty Agencies\n</td> <td>2,565,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,018,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,313,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Student Lending Placement Volume\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,571,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,770,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,173,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere are five potential outcomes to the student loan recovery process from which we generate revenues. These outcomes include: full repayment, recurring payments, rehabilitation, loan restructuring and wage garnishment. Of these five potential outcomes, our ability to rehabilitate defaulted student loans is the most significant component of our revenues in this market. Generally, a loan is considered successfully rehabilitated after the student loan borrower has made nine consecutive qualifying monthly payments and our client has notified us that it is recalling the loan. Once we have structured and implemented a repayment program for a defaulted borrower, we (i) earn a percentage of each periodic payment collected up to and including the final periodic payment prior to the loan being considered rehabilitated\u201d by our clients, and (ii) if the loan is rehabilitated,\u201d then we are paid a one-time percentage of the total amount of the remaining unpaid balance for each rehabilitated loan. The fees we are paid vary by recovery outcome as well as by contract. For non-government-supported student loans we are generally only paid contingency fees on two outcomes: full repayment or recurring repayments. The table below describes our typical fee structure for each of these five outcomes.\nStudent Loan Recovery Outcomes\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Repayment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recurring Payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rehabilitation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loan Restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Wage Garnishment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022 Repayment in full of the loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 Regular structured payments, typically according to a renegotiated payment plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 After a defaulted borrower has made nine consecutive recurring payments, the loan is eligible for rehabilitation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 Restructure and consolidate a number of outstanding loans into a single loan, typically with one monthly payment and an extended maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 If we are unable to obtain voluntary repayment, payments may be obtained through wage garnishment after certain administrative requirements are met\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022 We are paid a percentage of the full payment that is made\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 We are paid a percentage of each payment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 We are paid based on a percentage of the overall value of the rehabilitated loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 We are paid based on a percentage of overall value of the restructured loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2022 We are paid a percentage of each payment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur revenues from student lending were approximately 29% lower in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily as a result of the change in our relationship with Great Lakes, for which we acted as the primary recovery contractor until September 2017 and as a subcontractor on a portion of the overall portfolio since that time.\nHealthcare\nWe derive revenues from both commercial and government clients in the healthcare market. Revenues earned under these contracts are driven by auditing, identifying, and sometimes recovering improperly paid claims through both automated and manual review of such claims. We are paid contingency fees by our clients based on a percentage of the dollar amount of improper claims recovered as a result of our efforts. The revenues we recognize are net of our estimate of claims that we believe will be overturned by appeal following payment by the provider.\nOn October 5, 2017, we announced that we were awarded the MSP CRC contract by the CMS. Under this agreement, we are responsible for identifying and recovering payments in situations where Medicare should not be the primary payer of healthcare claims because a beneficiary has other forms of insurance coverage, such as through an employer group health plan or certain other payers.\nOn October 26, 2016, CMS awarded new RAC contracts and we received RAC contracts for audit Regions 1 and 5. The RAC contract award for Region 1 allows us to continue our audit of payments under Medicare's Part A and Part B for all provider types other than DMEPOS and home health and hospice within an 11 state region in the Northeast and Midwest. The Region 5 RAC contract provides for the post-payment review of DMEPOS and home health and hospice claims nationally. While audit and recovery activity under the new contracts commenced in April 2017, the scope of audit permitted by CMS under the new RAC contracts has been limited to 0.5% of claims. We do not expect to recognize significant revenues from the newly awarded RAC contracts until the percentage of claims we are able to audit increases from the current 0.5% of the claims.\nWe accrue an estimated liability for appeals based on the amount of commissions received which are subject to appeal and which we estimate are probable of being returned to providers following successful appeal. The $18.5 million balance as of December 31, 2017, represented our best estimate of the probable amount that we may be required to refund related to appeals of claims for which commissions were previously collected. The term of our first Medicare Recovery Audit Contract with CMS, for Region A, expired on January 31, 2018. Our estimates for this appeals liability are based on our historical experience\nwith the Medicare RAC appeal process. As the term of the original contract expired, CMS issued a letter to us on January 2, 2018, stating that Performant will no longer be obligated to support the appeals process or maintain an appeal reserve after the January 31, 2018 contract termination date. In addition to the estimated liability for appeals, we also maintained a separate net payable to client liability for appeals decisions which had been decided, but not yet refunded to CMS. On January 31, 2018, CMS issued to us their final Letter of Demand which reconciled all outstanding payables to CMS for the old Region A contract. Accordingly, we released an aggregate of approximately $27.8 million and $0.6 million of the estimated liability for appeals and the net payable to client balances, during the first quarter and third quarter of 2018, respectively. This increased first quarter 2018 revenue by $27.8 million and third quarter revenue by $0.6 million. In conjunction with the release, we also derecognized approximately $9.0 million of prepaid expenses and other current assets, with a charge to other operating expenses, reflecting accrued receivables associated with amounts due to us from our subcontractors for decided and yet-to-be decided appeals. As a result, we no longer have any estimated liability for appeals relating to our first CMS contract. We have accrued $0.2 million of additional estimated liability for appeals related to other healthcare contracts at December 31, 2018.\nFor our commercial healthcare business, our business strategy is focused on utilizing our technology-enabled services platform to provide audit, recovery and analytical services for private healthcare payers. We have entered into contracts with several private payers, although these contracts are in the early stage of implementation. Revenues from our commercial healthcare clients were $14.1 million for 2018 compared to revenues of $8.5 million that we earned from our commercial healthcare clients in 2017.\nOther\nWe also derive revenues from the recovery of delinquent state and federal taxes, and federal treasury and other receivables, default aversion and/or first party call center services for certain clients and the licensing of hosted technology solutions to certain clients. For our hosted technology services, we license our system and integrate our technology into our clients' operations, for which we are paid a licensing fee. Our revenues for these services include contingency fees, fees based on dedicated headcount to our clients and hosted technology licensing fees.\nCosts and Expenses\nWe generally report two categories of operating expenses: salaries and benefits and other operating expense. Salaries and benefits expenses consist primarily of salaries and performance incentives paid and benefits provided to our employees. Other operating expense includes expenses related to our use of subcontractors, other production related expenses, including costs associated with data processing, retrieval of medical records, printing and mailing services, amortization and other outside services, as well as general corporate and administrative expenses.\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Results\nOur results of operations are influenced by a number of factors, including allocation of placement volume, claim recovery volume, contingency fees, regulatory matters, client retention and macroeconomic factors.\nAllocation of Placement Volume\nOur clients have the right to unilaterally set and increase or reduce the volume of defaulted student loans or other receivables that we service at any given time. In addition, many of our recovery contracts for student loans and other receivables are not exclusive, with our clients retaining multiple service providers to service portions of their portfolios. Accordingly, the number of delinquent student loans or other receivables that are placed with us may vary from time to time, which may have a significant effect on the amount and timing of our revenues. We believe the major factors that influence the number of placements we receive from our clients in the student loan market include our performance under our existing contracts and our ability to perform well against competitors for a particular client. To the extent that we perform well under our existing contracts and differentiate our services from those of our competitors, we may receive a relatively greater number of placements under these existing contracts and may improve our ability to obtain future contracts from these clients and other potential clients. Further, delays in placement volume, as well as acceleration of placement volume, from any of our large clients may cause our revenues and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter.\nTypically, we are able to anticipate with reasonable accuracy the timing and volume of placements of defaulted student loans and other receivables based on historical patterns and regular communication with our clients. Occasionally, however, placements are delayed due to factors outside of our control.\nContingency Fees\nOur revenues consist primarily of contract-based contingency fees. The contingency fee percentages that we earn are set by our clients or agreed upon during the bid process and may change from time to time either under the terms of existing contracts or pursuant to the terms of contract renewals.\nRegulatory Matters\nEach of the markets which we serve is highly regulated. Accordingly, changes in regulations that affect the types of loans, receivables and claims that we are able to service or the manner in which any such delinquent loans, receivables and claims can be recovered will affect our revenues and results of operations. For example, the passage of the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, or SAFRA, in 2010 had the effect of transferring the origination of all government-supported student loans to the Department of Education, thereby ending all student loan originations guaranteed by the GAs. Loans guaranteed by the GAs represented approximately 70% of government-supported student loans originated in 2009. While the GAs will continue to service existing outstanding student loans for years to come, this legislation means that there will be no further growth in student loans held by GAs. Further, we are seeing a larger amount of defaulted student loans in our GA client portfolios that have been previously rehabilitated and by regulation are not subject to rehabilitation for a second time. In addition, our entry into the healthcare market was facilitated by passage of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which mandated CMS to contract with private firms to audit Medicare claims in an effort to increase the recovery of improper Medicare payments. Any changes to the regulations that affect the student loan industry or the recovery of defaulted student loans or the Medicare program generally or the audit and recovery of Medicare claims could have a significant impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nClient Contract Cancellation\nSubstantially all of our contracts entitle our clients to unilaterally terminate their contractual relationship with us at any time without penalty. If we lose one or more of our significant clients, including if one of our significant clients is consolidated by an entity that does not use our services, if the terms of compensation for our services change or if there is a reduction in the level of placements provided by any of these clients, our revenues could decline.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nCertain macroeconomic factors influence our business and results of operations. These include the increasing volume of student loan originations in the U.S. as a result of increased tuition costs and student enrollment, the default rate of student loan borrowers, the growth in Medicare expenditures resulting from increasing healthcare costs, as well as the fiscal budget tightening of federal, state and local governments as a result of general economic weakness and lower tax revenues.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period-to-period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU that amends the FASB ASC by creating a new Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We adopted Topic 606 as of January 1, 2018, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition. We applied Topic 606 retrospectively for all reporting periods presented before January 1, 2018, the date of the initial application. There was no impact of adopting Topic 606 on our 2017 and 2016 consolidated financial statements.\nWe derive our revenues primarily from providing recovery services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n \u2022 Identification of the contract with a customer \n \u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract \n \u2022 Determination of the transaction price \n \u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract \n \u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied  We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nOur contracts generally contain a single performance obligation, delivered over time as a series of services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to a client, as the promise to transfer the individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. We determine the standalone selling prices by taking into consideration the value of the services being provided, the client type and how similar services are priced in other contracts on a standalone basis.\nOur contracts are composed primarily of variable consideration. Fees earned under our recovery service contracts consist primarily of contingency fees based on a specified percentage of the amount we enable our clients to recover. The contingency fee percentage for a particular recovery depends on the type of recovery or claim facilitated. In certain contracts we can earn additional performance-based consideration determined based on its performance relative to a client's other contractors providing similar services.\nRevenue from contingency fees earned upon recovery of funds is generally recognized as amounts are invoiced based on either the \u2018as-invoiced' practical expedient when such amounts reflect the value of the services completed to-date, or an output metric used to measure progress of the satisfaction of its performance obligation. We estimate any performance-based variable consideration and recognizes such revenue over the performance period only if it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Under certain contracts, consideration can include periodic performance-based bonuses which can be awarded based on our performance under the specific contract. These performance-based awards are considered variable and may be constrained by us until there is not a risk of a material reversal.\nFor contracts that contain a refund right, these amounts are considered variable consideration, and we estimate our refund liability for each claim and recognizes revenue net of such estimate.\nWe generally either apply the as-invoiced practical expedient where our right to consideration corresponds directly to our right to invoice our clients, or the variable consideration allocation exception where the variable consideration is attributable to one or more, but not all, of the services promised in a series of distinct services that form part of a single performance obligation. As such, we have elected the optional exemptions related to the as-invoiced practical expedient and the variable consideration allocation exception whereby the disclosure of the amount of transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations is not required.\nWe have applied the as-invoiced practical expedient and the variable consideration allocation exception to contracts with performance obligations that have an average remaining duration of less than a year.\nRevenue is recognized upon the collection of defaulted loan and debt payments. Loan rehabilitation revenue is recognized when the rehabilitated loans are sold (funded) by clients. Incentive revenue is recognized upon receipt of official notification of incentive award from customers. Under our MSP CRC contract with CMS, we recognize revenues when insurance companies or other responsible parties remit payment to reimburse CMS for claims for which they are responsible, and the remittance has been applied in the CMS database. Under our RAC contracts with CMS, we recognize revenues when the healthcare provider has paid CMS for a claim or has agreed to an offset against other claims by the provider. Under other healthcare contracts, we may recognize revenue upon delivering the results of claims audits, when sufficient reliable information is available to us for estimating the variable consideration earned, as it is a reasonable measure of our progress toward complete satisfaction of our performance obligation.\nHealthcare providers have the right to appeal a claim and may pursue additional level of appeals if the initial appeal is found in favor of CMS. We accrue an estimated liability for appeals at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the amount of revenue probable of being returned to CMS following successful appeal based on historical data and other trends relating to such appeals. In addition, if our estimate of liability for appeals with respect to revenues recognized during a prior period changes, we increase or decrease the estimated liability for appeals in the current period.\nThis estimated liability for appeals is an offset to revenues on our income statement. Resolution of appeals can take a very long time to resolve and there is a significant backlog in the system for resolving appeals, as over the course of our existing RAC contract, healthcare providers have increased their pursuit of appeals beyond the first and second levels of appeal to the third level of appeal, where cases are heard by administrative law judges, or ALJs. In our experience, decisions at the third level of appeal are the least favorable as ALJs exercise greater discretion and there is less predictability in the ALJ decisions as compared to appeals at the first or second levels. This increase of ALJ appeals and backlog of claims at the third level of appeal is the primary reason our total estimated liability for appeals (consisting of the estimated liability for appeals plus the contra-accounts-receivable estimated allowance for appeals) has historically remained at a consistent level despite decreasing revenue from CMS. On January 31, 2018, CMS issued to us their final Letter of Demand which reconciled all outstanding payables to CMS for the old Region A contract. Accordingly, we released an aggregate of approximately $27.8 million and $0.6 million of the estimated liability for appeals and the Net payable to client balances, during the first quarter and third quarter of 2018, respectively. This increased first quarter 2018 revenue by $27.8 million and third quarter revenue by $0.6 million. In conjunction with the release, we also derecognized approximately $9.0 million of prepaid expenses and other current assets, with a charge to other operating expenses, reflecting accrued receivables associated with amounts due to us from our subcontractors for decided and yet-to-be decided appeals. As a result, we no longer have any estimated liability for appeals relating to our first CMS contract. The Company has accrued $0.2 million of additional estimated liability for appeals related to other healthcare contracts at December 31, 2018, which represents our best estimate of the probable amount of losses related to appeals of claims for which commissions were previously collected. To the extent that required payments by us related to successful appeals exceed the amount accrued, revenues in the applicable period would be reduced by the amount of the excess.\nWe determined that we do not have any costs related to obtaining or fulfilling a contract that are recoverable and as such, these contract costs are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair value assigned to the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We perform our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill fair value is less than its carrying amount in November of each year to allow us additional time to evaluate our assessment prior to reporting its results. We performed a quantitative impairment assessment of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill fair value is less than its carrying amount as of November 30, 2018, and concluded that there was no need to impair goodwill.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table represents our historical operating results for the periods presented:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>96,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expense\n</td> <td>58,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n</td> <td>2,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>157,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(1,797\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(4,699\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,972\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,273\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>(6,468\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,054\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,586\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>1,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,325\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,867\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(216\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,010\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,729\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,719\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were $155.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $23.6 million or 18%, compared to total revenues of $132.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nStudent lending revenues were $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $27.8 million, or 29%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily a result of the wind down relating to Great Lakes and decrease in the number of borrowers that are participating in the rehabilitation programs with our GA clients.\nHealthcare revenues were $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $46.0 million, or 460%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in healthcare revenues attributable to our CMS RAC contract and MSP CRC was $40.4 million, and the increase attributable to our revenues from our commercial healthcare clients was $5.5 million in 2018. This increase was due primarily to the release of $28.4 million of the estimated liability for appeals and the net payable to client balances for the old CMS Region A contract, and the ramp up of our CMS MSP CRC contract and other contracts with our commercial healthcare customers.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits expense was $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $14.0 million, or 17%, compared to salaries and benefits expense of $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to increased headcount during 2018 in anticipation of ramp up of activity related to new clients and contracts and the acquisition of Premiere.\nOther Operating Expense\nOther operating expense was $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.5 million, or 4%, compared to other operating expense of $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to a $7.1 million derecognition of subcontractor receivable associated with the termination of the 2009 CMS Region A contract, a $1.9 million allowance for doubtful accounts against subcontractor receivable and higher rent, utilities and maintenance expenses which were offset by lower third party collection fees.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.9 million, compared to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. An impairment expense of $3.0 million was recognized in 2018 relating to the write-off of the Great Lakes customer relationship intangible asset. The impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 million that was recognized in 2017 relates to the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets in one of our subsidiaries, Performant Europe Ltd., due to the Company's decision to wind down activity in this business in 2017.\nLoss from Operations\nAs a result of the factors described above, loss from operations was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to loss from operations of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $5.3 million, or 75%.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of 33%. Interest expense decreased due to a lower annual average principal debt balance and lower interest rates under our current Credit Agreement in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax provision was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective income tax rate changed to (23%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 9% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily driven by the current year losses for which no benefit is being recognized due to the valuation allowance.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the factors described above, net loss was $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which represents a decrease of $4.7 million compared to net loss of $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table presents our historical operating results for the periods presented:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,311\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>82,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expense\n</td> <td>55,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n</td> <td>1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>139,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(7,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(6,972\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,897\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(925\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>(14,054\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,823\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,769\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>(1,325\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,370\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Loss\n</td> <td>(12,729\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,453\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were $132.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $9.3 million or 7%, compared to total revenues of $141.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is due to a decline in revenues in both our student lending and healthcare markets.\nStudent lending revenues were $94.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $15.3 million, or 14%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily a result of the expiration of the Department of Education contract in April 2015 and subsequent wind down, partially offset by an increase in revenue as a result of an increase in the number of borrowers that are participating in the rehabilitation programs with our Guaranty Agency clients.\nHealthcare revenues were $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $1.4 million, or 12%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was due primarily to the wind down of our first RAC contract during 2017, offset by an approximately $2.9 million increase in revenues from commercial healthcare customers.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits expense was $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $3.3 million, or 4%, compared to salaries and benefits expense of $78.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to increased headcount during 2017 in anticipation of ramp up of activity related to new clients and contracts.\nOther Operating Expense\nOther operating expense was $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.9 million, or 2%, compared to other operating expense of $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to higher third party collection fees.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $14.4 million, compared to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 million that was recognized in 2017 relates to the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets in one of our subsidiaries, Performant Europe Ltd., due to the Company's decision to wind down activity in this business in 2017. In 2016, we wrote off of $15.4 million related to the Department of Education customer relationship intangible after the Department of Education announced in December 2016 that we would not be a recipient of the new contract awards.\nLoss from Operations\nAs a result of the factors described above, loss from operations was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to loss from operations of $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a decrease of $0.8 million, or 11%.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a decrease of 12%. Interest expense decreased due to repayments of principal under our prior credit agreement resulting in a lower outstanding balance in 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax benefit was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 28% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a loss from operations in 2017 for which the tax benefit is not recognized due to the valuation allowance and the accrued state income tax expense related to income from operations that is taxed in separate state jurisdictions.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the factors described above, net loss was $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents an increase of $1.3 million compared to net loss of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash flows from operations. Cash and cash equivalents, which excludes restricted cash, totaled $5.5 million as of December 31, 2018. Due to our operating cash flows and our existing cash and cash equivalents and our ability to restructure both our variable and fixed expenses, we believe that we have the ability to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future.\nThe $16.3 million decrease in the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 compared with December 31, 2017 was primarily due to our net loss, the principal and interest payments on our long-term debt and delay in timing of cash inflows from trade receivables, which was offset by delayed draw of $4.0 million of loan proceeds in 2018.\nThe following table presents information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,149\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(5,360\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,259\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,866\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>1,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40,637\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activities\nOperating activities used $12.1 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $15.1 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease included a net loss of $8.0 million in 2018, an increase in trade receivables of $6.7 million, and a decrease in the net\npayable to client of $2.9 million, which was partially offset by various working capital fluctuations such as a decrease in our income tax receivable of $6.7 million.\nOperating activities provided $3.0 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $14.8 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease included a net loss of $12.7 million in 2017 and was partially offset by various working capital fluctuations such as an increase in our income tax receivable of $4.8 million, an increase in trade receivables of $1.0 million and a decrease in other current liabilities of $1.1 million.\nOperating activities provided $17.8 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $1.6 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our net loss of $11.5 million in 2016 includes $15.4 million of non-cash customer-relationship impairment expense. Taking account of this non-cash expense, operating activities during 2016 provided cash at a level similar to 2015. Additional operating cash was provided by a reduction in trade receivables of $6.5 million. These items were partially offset by various working capital fluctuations such as an increase in our income tax receivable of $2.0 million and a decrease in net payable to client of $1.3 million.\nCash flows from investing activities\nInvesting activities resulted in cash outflow of $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and was primarily for capital expenditures related to information technology, hardware, data storage and security enhancements to our operating software offset by the working capital related to the acquisition of Premiere.\nInvesting activities resulted in cash outflow of $7.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and was primarily for capital expenditures related to information technology, hardware, data storage and security enhancements to our operating software.\nInvesting activities resulted in cash outflow of $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 and was primarily for capital expenditures related to information technology, data storage, hardware, telecommunication systems and security enhancements to our proprietary software.\nCash flows from financing activities\nCash provided from financing activities of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to additional borrowings on notes payable of $4.0 million, offset by the repayment of principal on outstanding debt of $2.2 million.\nCash used in financing activities of $12.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the repayment of principal on outstanding debt and other contractual obligations of $55.5 million, additional borrowings on notes payable of $44.0 million, and $0.9 million in debt issuance costs for amendments to our credit agreement.\nCash used in financing activities of $40.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the repayment of principal on outstanding debt and other contractual obligations of $39.1 million, and $1.2 million in debt issuance costs for amendments to our credit agreement.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash included in current assets on our consolidated balance sheet was $1.8 million as of December 31, 2018, and $1.8 million as of December 31, 2017. In November 2017, the Company deposited $1.8 million in restricted cash as collateral for new letters of credit issued to replace letters of credit terminated under our prior credit agreement.\nLong-term Debt\nOn August 7, 2017, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Performant Business Services, Inc. (the \"Borrower\"), entered into a credit agreement with ECMC Group, Inc. (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d). Before the amendment described below, the Credit Agreement provided for a term loan facility in the initial amount of $44 million (the Initial Term Loan\u201d) and for up to $15 million of additional term loans ( Additional Term Loans\u201d; and together with the Initial Term Loan, the Loans\u201d) which original Additional Term Loans were initially able to be drawn until the second anniversary of the funding of the Initial Term Loans, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. On August 11, 2017, the Initial Term Loan was advanced (the \"Closing Date\") and the proceeds were applied to repay all outstanding amounts under our prior credit agreement with Madison Capital Funding LLC as administrative agent (\"the Prior Credit Agreement\"). On August 31, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement to among other things (i) extend the maturity date of the Initial Term Loan and\nany Additional Term Loans by one year to August 2021, (ii) expand the Additional Term Loans commitment from $15 million to $25 million, (iii) extend the period during which the Additional Term Loans can be borrowed by one year to August 2020, and (iv) relieve the Borrower from its obligation to comply with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement during the six fiscal quarters following the Premiere acquisition. On October 15, 2018, the Company borrowed $4 million of the $25 million available as Additional Term Loans under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, $45.8 million was outstanding under the Credit Agreement. On March 21, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement to among other things relieve the Borrower from its obligation to comply with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement until the quarter ending June 30, 2020.\nWe have the option to extend the maturity of the Loans for two additional one year periods, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. The Loans bear interest at the one-month LIBOR rate (subject to a 1% per annum floor) plus a margin which may vary from 5.5% per annum to 10.0% per annum based on our total debt to EBITDA ratio. Our annual interest rate at December 31, 2018, was 8.0%, and at December 31, 2017 was 8.6%. We are required to pay 5% of the original principal balance of the Loans annually in quarterly installments and to make mandatory prepayments of the Loans with a percentage of our excess cash flow which may vary between 75% and 0% depending on our total debt to EBITDA ratio and from the net cash proceeds of certain asset dispositions and debt not otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement, in each case, subject to the lender's right to decline to receive such payments. The Loans may be voluntarily prepaid at any time, together with a prepayment premium of 1% for all voluntary prepayments prior to August 11, 2019.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants which are not effective until the quarter ending June 30, 2020, at which point, we will be required to (1) achieve a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 through December 31, 2020, 1.25 to 1.0 through June 30, 2021, and 1.25 to 1.0 through June 30, 2022 if the maturity date of the Loans is extended until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (2) maintain a maximum total debt to EBITDA ratio of 6.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants that restrict the Company and its subsidiaries' ability to incur certain types or amounts of indebtedness, incur liens on certain assets, make material changes in corporate structure or the nature of its business, dispose of material assets, engage in a change in control transaction, make certain foreign investments, enter into certain restrictive agreements, or engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also contains various customary events of default, including with respect to change of control of the Company or its ownership of the Borrower.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our United States domestic subsidiaries' assets and are guaranteed by the Company and its United States domestic subsidiaries, other than the Borrower.\nAs a result of our entry into our Credit Agreement, and the repayment of all amounts owed under our Prior Credit Agreement, we wrote off debt issuance costs related to our Prior Credit Agreement of approximately $1.0 million in August 2017.\nIn consideration for, and concurrently with, the extension of the Initial Term Loan in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, we issued a warrant to the lender to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,863,326 shares of the Company's common stock (representing approximately up to 7.5% of our diluted common stock as calculated using the treasury stock\u201d method as defined under U.S. GAAP for the most recent fiscal quarter, with an exercise price of $1.92 per share (the \"Exercise Price\")). In connection with the October 15, 2018 Additional Term Loan borrowing of $4 million, we were required to, and did, issue a warrant to the lender to purchase an aggregate of 309,066 shares of the Company's common stock at the same Exercise Price of $1.92 per share. Upon any further borrowing of the Additional Term Loans, we will be required to issue additional warrants at the same Exercise Price to purchase up to an aggregate of 77,267 additional shares of common stock (which represents approximately 0.15% of our diluted common stock calculated using the treasury stock\u201d method as defined under U.S. GAAP for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017) for each $1.0 million of such Additional Term Loans. Similarly, upon our election to extend the maturity of the Loans for additional one year periods, we will be required to issue additional warrants at the same Exercise Price to purchase up to an aggregate of 515,110 additional shares of common stock for the first year's extension, and to purchase up to an aggregate of 772,665 additional shares of common stock for the second year's extension (which represent approximately 1.0% and 1.5% of our diluted common stock for the first and second years, respectively, calculated using the treasury stock\u201d method as defined under U.S. GAAP for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017).\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\nThan\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\nThan\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Payments\n</td> <td>8,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>13,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations\n</td> <td>7,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in the table below and within this report adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided a reconciliation below of adjusted EBITDA to net income and adjusted net income to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income in this report because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income provide useful information to investors and analysts in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nOur use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense on our indebtedness; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income do not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income do not reflect the impact of certain non-operating expenses resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance; and \n \u2022 other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income differently than we do, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.  Because of these limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other GAAP results.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 to actual net income (loss) for these periods:\nTable
