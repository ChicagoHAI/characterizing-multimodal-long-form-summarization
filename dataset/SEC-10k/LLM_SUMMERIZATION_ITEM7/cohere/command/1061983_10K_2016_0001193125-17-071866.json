Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. Operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 as Cytokinetics, Incorporated. We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of first-in-class muscle activators as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which muscle performance is compromised and/or declining. Our research and development activities relating to the biology of muscle function have evolved from our knowledge and expertise regarding the cytoskeleton, a complex biological infrastructure that plays a fundamental role within every human cell. Our most advanced research and development programs relate to the biology of muscle function and are directed to small molecule modulators of the contractility of skeletal or cardiac muscle. We are also conducting earlier-stage research directed to other compounds with the potential to modulate muscle contractility and other muscle functions, such as growth, energetics and metabolism.\nOur drug candidates currently in clinical development are our fast skeletal troponin activators tirasemtiv and CK-2127107, and our cardiac muscle activator omecamtiv mecarbil. Tirasemtiv is being evaluated for the\npotential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\u201cALS\u201d). CK-2127107 is being evaluated for the potential treatment of spinal muscle atrophy (\u201cSMA\u201d) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\u201cCOPD\u201d) and for potential use in other indications associated with muscle weakness (including ALS) under a strategic alliance with Astellas Pharma Inc. (\u201cAstellas\u201d) established in 2013 and expanded in 2014 and 2016. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being evaluated for the potential treatment of heart failure under a strategic alliance with Amgen established in 2006.\nMuscle Contractility Programs\nSkeletal Muscle Contractility Program\nTirasemtiv is our lead drug candidate from this program. We retain exclusive rights to tirasemtiv, subject to Astellas' exercise of its option for a license to tirasemtiv (see \u201cAstellas' Option on Tirasemtiv\u201d below). We conducted a Phase 2 clinical development program for tirasemtiv, and we started a Phase 3 clinical development program for this drug candidate in patients with ALS in July 2015 known as VITALITY-ALS (Ventilatory Investigation of Tirasemtiv and Assessment of Longitudinal Indices after Treatment for a Year in ALS). Tirasemtiv has been granted orphan drug designation and fast track status by the FDA and orphan medicinal product designation by the European Medicines Agency, in each case for the potential treatment of ALS.\nIn collaboration with Astellas, we are also developing another drug candidate from this program, CK-2127107, for potential indications associated with muscle weakness. We started a Phase 2 clinical trial for CK-2127107 in patients with SMA in December 2015. Astellas, in collaboration with Cytokinetics, started a Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with COPD in June 2016. Tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 are structurally distinct and selective small molecules that activate the fast skeletal troponin complex in the sarcomere by increasing its sensitivity to calcium, leading to an increase in skeletal muscle contractility. Each of tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 has demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models and evidence of potentially clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effects in humans. We are evaluating other potential indications for which tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 may be useful.\nTirasemtiv\nFurther details regarding tirasemtiv and VITALITY-ALS can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Skeletal Muscle Contractility Program - Tirasemtiv.\u201d\nThe clinical trials program for tirasemtiv may proceed for several years, and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved, and the drug is commercialized. Tirasemtiv is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur. Our expenditures are expected to increase as we continue to progress tirasemtiv towards potential registration.\nCK-2127107 and Other Skeletal Muscle Activators\nAstellas Strategic Alliance. CK-2127107 is being developed jointly by Cytokinetics and Astellas.\nIn July 2016, we entered into the 2016 Astellas Amendment collectively with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, the \u201cCurrent Astellas Agreement.\u201d\nAstellas holds an exclusive license to develop and commercialize CK-2127107 worldwide, subject to our development and commercialization participation rights. Under this strategic alliance, Cytokinetics conducted five Phase 1 clinical trials of CK-2127107 and started a Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (\u201cSMA\u201d) in December 2015. CK-2127107 is also being evaluated for the potential use in other indications associated with muscle weakness. Astellas, in collaboration with Cytokinetics, started a Phase 2\nclinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with COPD in June 2016 and we anticipate Astellas will initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial of CK-2127107 in elderly patients with limited mobility in the first half of 2017. We are also conducting joint research with Astellas directed to next-generation skeletal muscle activators.\nFurther details regarding our strategic alliance with Astellas can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Skeletal Muscle Contractility Program - CK-2127107 and Other Skeletal Muscle Activators - Astellas Strategic Alliance.\u201d\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company recorded license revenue of $62.2 million, $13.9 million and $9.8 million respectively, reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities of $13.1 million, $12.2 million, and $15.4 million, respectively, and milestone revenues of $2.0 million, zero and $17.0 million, in connection with our strategic alliance with Astellas. Refer to Note 7, \u201cRelated Parties and Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the accounting treatment, including the allocation of consideration to the units of accounting, and the revenue recognition of License Revenue and Research and Development Revenue, under the 2016 Astellas Amendment.\nThe clinical trials programs for CK-2127107 may proceed for several years, and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved, and the drug is commercialized. CK-2127107 is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur. Our expenditures will increase if Astellas terminates development of CK-2127107 or related compounds and we elect to develop them independently, or if we conduct early-stage development for certain agreed indications at our initial expense, subject to reimbursement if development continues under the collaboration.\nOngoing Research in Skeletal Muscle Activators.\nOur research on the direct activation of skeletal muscle continues in two areas. We are conducting translational research in preclinical models of disease and muscle function with fast skeletal troponin activators to explore the potential clinical applications of this novel mechanism in diseases or conditions associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction. We also intend to conduct preclinical research on other chemically and pharmacologically distinct mechanisms to activate the skeletal sarcomere. We advanced a next generation skeletal muscle activator into IND-enabling studies in 2016 and earned a $2.0 million milestone payment. We are conducting a joint research program with Astellas directed to the discovery of next-generation skeletal muscle activators. Under the 2016 Astellas Amendment, the joint research program will continue through 2017 and Astellas will reimburse us for certain research activities.\nResearch and Development Expenses. We recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our skeletal muscle contractility program of approximately $53.7 million, $36.3 million and $32.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recognized research and development revenue from Astellas of $15.1 million, $12.2 million, and $32.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, consisting of milestone payments, and reimbursements of full-time employee equivalents (\u201cFTEs\u201d) and other expenses. We anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our skeletal muscle contractility program will increase significantly if and as we advance tirasemtiv, CK-2127107 or other compounds from this program into and through development.\nCardiac Muscle Contractility Program\nOur lead drug candidate from our cardiac muscle contractility program, omecamtiv mecarbil (formerly known as CK-1827452), is a novel cardiac muscle myosin activator that is being developed under a strategic alliance with Amgen. In June 2013, we expanded this collaboration to include Japan. As a result, Amgen holds an exclusive, worldwide license to omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds, subject to Cytokinetics'\nspecified development and commercialization rights. Amgen has also entered an alliance with Servier for exclusive commercialization rights in Europe as well as the Commonwealth of Independent States (\u201cCIS\u201d), including Russia. In December 2016, we announced the activation of the first trial site for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil being conducted by Amgen in collaboration with Cytokinetics, GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure). We are continuing our joint research with Amgen directed to next-generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program in 2017.\nFurther details regarding our strategic alliance with Amgen can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Cardiac Muscle Contractility Program - Amgen Strategic Alliance.\u201d\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $1.2 million, $2.5 million and $4.5 million, respectively, in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities, respectively and milestone revenues of $26.7 million, zero and zero, relating to the Amgen Agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded zero license revenue under the Amgen Agreement. See our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policy under our agreement with Amgen. Refer to Note 7, \u201cRelated Parties and Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the accounting treatment, under the Amgen agreement.\nOmecamtiv Mecarbil Clinical Development\nGALACTIC-HF is a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil which is being conducted by Amgen, in collaboration with Cytokinetics. Coincident with the start of the trial, Amgen made a $26.7 million milestone payment to Cytokinetics in December 2016. The primary objective of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial is to determine if treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil when added to standard of care is superior to standard of care plus placebo in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure events in patients with high risk chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. GALACTIC-HF will be conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (\u201cSPA\u201d) with the U.S. FDA. GALACTIC-HF is planned to enroll approximately 8,000 symptomatic chronic heart failure patients in over 800 sites in 34 countries who are either currently hospitalized for a primary reason of heart failure or have had a hospitalization or admission to an emergency room for heart failure within one year prior to screening. In order to be eligible to participate in GALACTIC-HF patients should have an LVEF \u00a3 35%, be NYHA class II to IV, and have an elevated BNP or NT-proBNP. Patients will be randomized to either placebo or omecamtiv mecarbil with dose titration up to a maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily based on the plasma concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil after initiation of drug therapy. The primary endpoint is a composite of time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure event, which is defined as either a hospitalization for heart failure or other urgent treatment for worsening heart failure. Secondary endpoints include time to cardiovascular death; patient reported outcomes as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score; time to first heart failure hospitalization; and all-cause death.\nCytokinetics and Amgen are also planning a potential exercise performance/cardiac function clinical trial to be conducted by Cytokinetics. Amgen will be responsible for reimbursing us for the out-of-pocket development costs associated with this clinical trial.\nFurther details regarding the clinical development of omecamtiv mecarbil can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Cardiac Muscle Contractility Program - Omecamtiv Mecarbil\u201d\nOngoing Research in Cardiac Muscle Contractility. We continued our joint research program with Amgen directed to next-generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program in 2016. We expect to continue our joint research program with Amgen into 2017. Under the Amgen Agreement, Amgen will reimburse us for certain research activities we perform.\nThe clinical trials program for omecamtiv mecarbil may proceed for several years, and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved, and the drug is commercialized. Omecamtiv mecarbil is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur. We funded all research and development costs associated with this program prior to Amgen's option exercise in May 2009. We anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program will increase if we participate in the future advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil through clinical development. Our expenditures will also increase if Amgen terminates development of omecamtiv mecarbil or related compounds and we elect to develop them independently, or if we elect to co-fund later-stage development of omecamtiv mecarbil or other compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration and option agreement with Amgen.\nResearch and Development Expenses. We recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our cardiac muscle contractility program of approximately $8.1 million, $5.8 million and $7.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recognized net research and development revenue from Amgen of $1.2 million, $2.5 million and $4.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, consisting of reimbursements of FTEs and other expenses offset by a payment related to Cytokinetics' option to co-fund the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil for an increased royalty percentage. We anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program will increase if we participate in the future advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil through clinical development. We also anticipate incurring future payments related to the co-investment option for which we provided notice of exercise in 2016 that will be offset against research and development revenues.\nBeyond Muscle Contractility\nWe have developed preclinical expertise in the mechanics of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle that extends from proteins to tissues to intact animal models. Our translational research in muscle contractility has enabled us to better understand the potential impact of small molecule compounds that increase skeletal or cardiac muscle contractility and to apply those findings to the further evaluation of our drug candidates in clinical populations. In addition to contractility, the other major functions of muscle play a role in certain diseases that could benefit from novel mechanism treatments. Accordingly, our knowledge of muscle contractility may serve as an entry point to the discovery of novel treatments for disorders involving muscle functions other than muscle contractility. We are leveraging our current understandings of muscle biology to investigate new ways of modulating these other aspects of muscle function for other potential therapeutic applications.\nDevelopment Risks\nThe successful development of any of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. We cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature, timing and costs of the activities necessary to complete the development of any of our drug candidates or the date of completion of these development activities due to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to:\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the results of clinical trials of our drug candidates conducted by us or our partners may not support the further clinical development of those drug candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> further clinical development of tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS will require significant additional funding and we may be unable to obtain such additional funding on acceptable terms, if at all;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the FDA and/or other regulatory authorities may not accept effects on respiratory function, including SVC, as appropriate clinical trial endpoints to support the registration of tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the FDA and/or other regulatory authorities may not accept the data from the clinical trials of tirasemtiv as sufficient to determine the safest and most effective dose of tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> decisions made by Amgen with respect to the development of omecamtiv mecarbil and by Astellas with respect to the development of CK-2127107;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the uncertainty of the timing of the initiation and completion of patient enrollment and treatment in our or our partners' clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing of the analyses of our clinical trial data after these trials have been initiated and completed;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> our potential inability to obtain additional funding and resources for our development activities on acceptable terms, if at all, including, but not limited to, our potential inability to obtain or retain partners to assist in the design, management, conduct and funding of clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> failure by our clinical trial sites, clinical research organizations, clinical manufacturing organizations and other third parties supporting our or our partners' clinical trials to fulfill their obligations or otherwise perform as expected;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> delays or additional costs in manufacturing of our drug candidates for clinical trial use, including developing appropriate formulations of our drug candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the uncertainty of clinical trial results, including variability in patient response;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the uncertainty of obtaining FDA or other foreign regulatory agency approval required for the clinical investigation of our drug candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the uncertainty related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing processes and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the possibility that results from non-clinical studies may adversely impact the timing or further development of our drug candidates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> possible delays in the characterization, formulation and manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of drug candidates and other compounds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> If we fail to complete the development of any of our drug candidates in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and liquidity. In addition, any failure by us or our partners to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our programs as planned, or at all, and certain consequences of failing to do so are discussed further in the risk factors entitled \u201cWe will need substantial additional capital in the future to sufficiently fund our operations,\u201d \u201cWe have never generated, and may never generate, revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and we may not have drugs to market for at least several years, if ever,\u201d \u201cClinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay completion of clinical development and regulatory approval\u201d and \u201cClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and subject to delay,\u201d and other risk factors.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenues\nOur current revenue sources are limited, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for several years, if at all. We have recognized revenues from our strategic alliances with Amgen, Astellas, and MyoKardia, Inc. (\u201cMyoKardia\u201d) and grant revenues from The ALS Association (the \u201cALSA\u201d).\nThe following table summarizes the sources of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as follows (in thousands):\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Astellas\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,836 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenues from Astellas\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,227 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amgen\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development revenues, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenues from Amgen\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MyoKardia - Research and development revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ALSA - Grant Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,940 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Astellas\nIn June 2013, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Astellas (the \u201cOriginal Astellas Agreement\u201d), that was amended and restated in December 2014 (the \u201c2014 Astellas Agreement\u201d).\nRefer to Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Skeletal Muscle Contractility Program - CK-2127107 - Astellas Strategic Alliance\u201d for further details regarding the collaboration agreements.\nIn July 2013, we received an upfront payment of $16.0 million in connection with the execution of the Original Astellas Agreement. The Original Astellas Agreement provided for us to potentially receive over $24.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the initial two years of the collaboration and for research and early and late stage development milestone payments based on various research and clinical milestones. We determined the license and the research and development services relating to the Original Astellas Agreement are a single unit of accounting as the license was determined to not have stand-alone value. Accordingly, we are recognizing this revenue using the proportional performance model. During 2014, revenue from reimbursement of research and development activities also included $2.0 million in research and development milestone fees and $15.0 million in milestone fees in connection with the decision made by Astellas to advance CK-2127107 into Phase 2 clinical development.\nIn January 2015, we received an upfront license fee payment of $30.0 million in connection with the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement. Also, in conjunction with the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold 2,040,816 shares of our common stock to Astellas at a price per share of $4.90. The aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million was received in December 2014. We determined the fair value of the stock issued to Astellas to be $9.1 million. The $0.9 million excess of cash received over fair value of was deferred and will be recognized as revenue as services are performed over approximately 24 months. We determined that the license and the research and development services relating to the 2014 Astellas Agreement are a single unit of accounting as the license was determined to not have stand-alone value. Accordingly, we are recognizing this revenue using the proportional performance model over the initial research term of the 2014 Astellas Agreement.\nConcurrently with the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement and related common stock purchase agreement, we received $15.0 million as a milestone payment relating to Astellas' decision to advance CK-2127107 into Phase 2 clinical development. We were also eligible to potentially receive over $20.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the two years of the collaboration following the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement.\nIn 2016, Cytokinetics and Astellas further amended the collaboration agreement to expand the collaboration to include the development of CK-2127107 (\u201c2016 Astellas Amendment\u201d) for the potential treatment of ALS, as well as the possible development in ALS of other fast skeletal regulatory activators previously licensed by Cytokinetics to Astellas. The 2016 Astellas Amendment became effective in September 2016. In connection with the 2016 Astellas Amendment, we received a non-refundable upfront amendment fee of $35.0 million. In addition, we received the accelerated payment of a $15.0 million milestone for the initiation of the first Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 as the lead compound in ALS that was otherwise provided for in the 2014 Astellas Agreement, as if such milestone had been achieved upon the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment. We determined that the ALS license and the additional research and development services relating to the 2016 Astellas Amendment each have stand-alone value. We have recognized $50.0 million license revenue related to the ALS license on the effective date of the arrangement while the allocated consideration for the research and development services will be recognized over the development term on a proportional basis. During 2016, revenue from reimbursement of research and development activities also included $2.0 million in research and development milestone fees.\nRefer to Note 7, \u201cRelated Parties and Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the accounting treatment under this collaboration agreement.\nUnder the Current Astellas Agreement, additional research and early and late state development milestone payments which are based on various research and clinical milestones, including the initiation of certain clinical studies, the submission for approval of a drug candidate to certain regulatory authorities for marketing approval and the commercial launch of collaboration products could total over $600.0 million, including up to $95.0 million relating to CK-2127107 in non-neuromuscular indications, and over $100.0 million related to CK-2127107 in each of SMA and other neuromuscular indications. Additionally, $200.0 million in commercial milestones could be received under the Current Astellas Agreement provided certain sales targets are met. Due to the nature of drug development, including the inherent risk of development and approval of drug candidates by regulatory authorities, it is not possible to estimate if and when these milestone payments could become due.\nIn the event Astellas commercializes any collaboration products, the Company will receive royalties on sales of such collaboration products, including royalties ranging from the high single digits to the high teens on sales of products containing CK-2127107. We can co-fund certain development costs for CK-2127107 and other compounds in exchange for increased milestone payments and royalties; such royalties may increase under certain scenarios to exceed twenty percent. Under the Current Astellas Agreement, we retain an option to co-promote collaboration products containing fast skeletal troponin activators for neuromuscular indications in the U.S., Canada and Europe, in addition to its option to co-promote other collaboration products in the U.S. and Canada as provided for in the Original Astellas Agreement. Astellas will reimburse us for certain expenses associated with its co-promotion activities.\nIn connection with the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment, the Company received a $15.0 million non-refundable option fee for the grant of the Option on Tirasemtiv in October 2016. Prior to Astellas' exercise of the option, the Company will continue the development of tirasemtiv, including the VITALITY-ALS trial, at its own expense to support regulatory approval in the U.S., EU and certain other jurisdictions and will retain the final decision making authority on the development of tirasemtiv.\nAmgen\nIn June 2013, we and Amgen executed an amendment (the \u201cAmgen Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Amgen Agreement to include Japan, resulting in a worldwide collaboration.\nFurther details regarding our strategic alliance with Amgen can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Cardiac Muscle Contractility Program - Amgen Strategic Alliance.\u201d\nWe have received reimbursements from Amgen for certain research and development activities during 2016, 2015 and 2014, which we recorded as revenue as the related expenses were incurred. We may be eligible to receive further reimbursements from Amgen for certain research and development activities, which we will record as revenue if and when the related expenses are incurred. We record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue. Revenues related to the reimbursement of FTEs were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our FTEs.\nRefer to Note 7, \u201cRelated Parties and Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the accounting treatment under this collaboration agreement.\nUnder the Amgen Agreement, as amended, the Company is eligible to receive over $300.0 million in additional development milestone payments which are based on various clinical milestones, including the initiation of certain clinical studies, the submission of a drug candidate to certain regulatory authorities for marketing approval and the receipt of such approvals. Additionally, the Company is eligible to receive up to $300.0 million in commercial milestone payments provided certain sales targets are met. Due to the nature of drug development, including the inherent risk of development and approval of drug candidates by regulatory authorities, it is not possible to estimate if and when these milestone payments would become due. The achievement of each of these milestones is dependent solely upon the results of Amgen's development and commercialization activities and therefore none of these milestones was deemed to be substantive.\nIn December 2016, we received a $26.7 million milestone payment from Amgen coincident with the start of GALACTIC-HF. The $26.7 million milestone payment from Amgen was recognized as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recognized no revenue for milestones achieved under the Amgen Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Also in December 2016, we provided notice of our exercise of our option to co-invest in the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil in exchange for increased royalties from Amgen on worldwide sales of omecamtiv mecarbil outside Japan.\nMyoKardia\nIn August 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with MyoKardia. Under an agreed research plan, scientists from MyoKardia and our FTEs conducted research focused on small molecule therapeutics that inhibit cardiac sarcomere proteins. We provided MyoKardia access to certain research facilities, and provided FTEs and other resources at agreed reimbursement rates that approximated our costs. We were the primary obligor in the collaboration arrangement, and accordingly, we recorded expense reimbursements from MyoKardia as research and development revenue. The research plan ended as planned in August 2013. In October 2016, we received a $0.2 million milestone payment from MyoKardia for the initiation of first Phase IIa clinical trial.\nALSA Grant\nIn July 2015, we were awarded a $1.5 million grant from The ALS Association (the \u201cALSA Grant\u201d) to support the conduct of VITALITY-ALS as well as the collection of clinical data and plasma samples from patients in VITALITY-ALS in order to help advance the discovery of potentially useful biomarkers in ALS. The grant provides funding for collaboration among Cytokinetics, The ALS Association and the Barrow Neurological Institute to enable plasma samples collected from patients enrolled in VITALITY-ALS to be added to The Northeastern ALS Consortium (NEALS) Repository, a resource for the academic research community to identify biomarkers that may help to assess disease progression and underlying disease mechanisms in ALS. In August 2015, we achieved the first milestone under the ALSA Grant which triggered a payment of $0.5 million in accordance with the ALSA Grant and in 2016, we achieved a second milestone which triggered a payment of $0.3 million in accordance with the ALSA Grant. We recorded grant revenue as qualified expenses were incurred and approved by management.\nBecause a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and other pre-commercialization milestones under our strategic alliances with Amgen and Astellas, our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year.\nIf one or more of our drug candidates is approved for sale as a drug, we expect that our future revenues will most likely be derived from royalties on sales from drugs licensed to Amgen and Astellas under our respective strategic alliances and from those licensed to future partners, and from direct sales of our drugs.\nResearch and Development\nWe incur research and development expenses associated with both partnered and our own research activities. We expect to incur research and development expenses for the clinical development of tirasemtiv. We expect to incur research and development expenses for CK-2127107 in accordance with agreed upon research and development plans with Astellas. We expect to incur research and development expenses for omecamtiv mecarbil and other next-generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program in accordance with agreed upon research and development plans with Amgen.\nResearch and development expenses related to any development and commercialization activities we elect to fund consist primarily of employee compensation, supplies and materials, costs for consultants and contract research and manufacturing, facilities costs and depreciation of equipment.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions, including, but not limited to, finance, human resources, legal, business and commercial development and strategic planning. Other significant costs include facilities costs, consulting costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and regulatory compliance.\nStock Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation related to stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchases for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Amgen. Revenues from Astellas, which became a related party in December 2014, were $15.1 million, $12.2 million, and $15.0 million for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and consisted of reimbursements of internal costs for certain full-time employee equivalents, and other research and development expenses. Revenues from Astellas in 2016 and 2014 included $2.0 million and $15.0 million in milestone revenues, respectively. All research and development revenues from Astellas, prior to it becoming a related party are classified in research and development, grant and other revenues. Revenues from Amgen were $27.9 million, $2.5 million and $4.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenue from Amgen in 2016 included $26.7 million in a milestone payment, and $0.6 million in reimbursement of internal costs for certain full-time employee equivalents, partially offset by a payment of $1.3 million related to the option to co-fund Phase 3 development of omecamtiv mecarbil for an increased royalty percentage. Revenue from Amgen in 2015 and 2014 consisted of reimbursement of internal costs for certain full-time employee equivalents, and recognition of allocated consideration relating to the Amgen Agreement Amendment.\nResearch and development, grant and other revenues in 2016 and 2015 consisted primarily of $1.1 million and $0.1 million of research and development revenues from our collaboration with ALSA, respectively. Research and development, grant and other revenues in 2014 consisted primarily of revenues from our strategic alliance with Astellas, prior to becoming a related party in December 2014, including $15.4 million of research and development reimbursement revenues and $2.0 million in milestone revenues from our collaboration with Astellas, as well as $0.1 million in revenue from our collaboration with MyoKardia.\nLicense revenues from related parties refers to license revenues from our strategic alliances with Astellas and Amgen. License revenues from Astellas, which became a related party in December 2014, were $62.2 million and $13.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. License revenue from Astellas in 2016 consisted of the recognition of the $50.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas under the 2016 Astellas Amendment, and the recognition of a portion of the $30.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas in January 2015. License revenue from Astellas in 2015 consisted of the recognition of a portion of the $30.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas in January 2015 and the recognition of a portion of the $16.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas in July 2013. The upfront license fees were recognized using the proportional performance model.\nLicense revenues refers to license revenues from our collaboration with Astellas, prior to it becoming a related party in December 2014. License revenues from Astellas included $9.8 million in 2014 of the $16.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas in July 2013 in connection with the execution of the Original Astellas Agreement. We recognized this revenue over the term of the research and development services using the proportional performance model.\nResearch and development expenses\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in research and development expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $12.1 million in outsourced clinical costs, $4.5 million in personnel related expenses and non-cash stock compensation expense, and $0.8 million in outsourced research costs, partially offset by a decrease of $4.2 million in outsourced preclinical costs mainly associated with clinical manufacturing activities. The increase in outsourced clinical costs was comprised of an increase of $16.6 million in outsourced clinical costs mainly associated with VITALITY-ALS, offset by a $4.5 million litigation settlement in June 2016 from a contract research organization for BENEFIT-ALS. The increase in research and development expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million in outsourced preclinical costs, an increase of $1.8 million in personnel related expenses due to increased headcount, and an increase of $0.4 million in lab expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in outsourced clinical costs associated with the completion of BENEFIT-ALS in the second quarter of 2014.\nThe following presents our research and development expenses by program:\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cardiac muscle contractility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Skeletal muscle contractility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Smooth muscle contractility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other research programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> From a program perspective, the $13.5 million increase in research and development spending in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increased spending of $12.9 million for our skeletal muscle contractility program, which included our skeletal muscle contractility program for tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS and the clinical program for CK-2127107 under our collaboration with Astellas, and a $2.3 million increase in our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration with Amgen, partially offset by decreased spending of $1.5 million in our other research and preclinical programs. The $2.0 million increase in research and development spending in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased spending of $3.4 million for our skeletal muscle contractility program, which included our skeletal muscle contractility program for tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS, and the clinical program for CK-2127107 under our collaboration with Astellas, and a $0.2 million increase in our other research and preclinical programs, partially offset by decreased spending of $1.6 million for our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration with Amgen.\nClinical development timelines, the likelihood of success and total completion costs vary significantly for each drug candidate and are difficult to estimate. We anticipate that we will determine on an ongoing basis which research and development programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program, taking into account the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate. The lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain and maintain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe expect our research and development expenditures to increase significantly in 2017 compared to 2016. We expect to continue the Phase 3 clinical development of our drug candidate tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS. Under our strategic alliance with Astellas, we expect to continue development of our drug candidate CK-2127107 for the potential treatment of SMA and potentially other diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness or wasting. Under our strategic alliance with Amgen, we expect to continue the Phase 3 development of our drug candidate omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> General and administrative expenses increased $8.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increased spending of $4.2 million in personnel-related expenses due to increased headcount and non-cash stock compensation expense, an increase of $1.7 million in corporate and patent legal fees, and an increase of $1.7 million in outsourced costs related to commercial development, grants and sponsorships, and accounting and finance and recruitment related costs. The increase of $2.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased spending of $1.4 million for personnel-related costs due to increased headcount and increased spending of $0.8 million for outside services mainly related to commercial development. We expect that general and administrative expenses in 2017 will increase significantly compared to 2016, mainly due to increased headcount.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily consisted of interest expense related to the loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank entered into in October 2015. Interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to interest expense related to the long-term debt obligations which commenced in fourth quarter 2015.\nInterest and Other Income, net\nInterest and other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, primarily consisted of interest income generated from the Company's cash, cash equivalents and investments. In 2016 and 2015, interest income also included net gains realized upon disposal of equipment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financial condition is summarized as follows:\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial assets:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current portions of long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total working capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> From August 5, 1997, our date of inception, through December 31, 2016, we funded our operations through the sale of equity securities, non-equity payments from collaborators, long term debt, capital equipment financings, grants and interest income. Due to our substantial research and development expenditures, we have generated significant operating losses since our inception. Our expenditures are primarily related to research and development activities. As of December 31, 2016, we had available cash, cash equivalents and investments of $163.9 million.\nEquity Securities\nWe have received net proceeds from the sale of equity securities of $500.0 million from August 5, 1997, the date of our inception, through December 31, 2016, excluding sales of equity to Amgen, Astellas, and GlaxoSmithKline (\u201cGSK\u201d). Included in these proceeds are $94.0 million received upon closing of the initial public offering of our common stock in May 2004. In connection with execution of our collaboration and license agreement with GSK in 2001, GSK made a $14.0 million equity investment in us. GSK made additional equity investments in us in 2003 and 2004 of $3.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. In January 2007, in connection with the execution of the Amgen Agreement, we received net proceeds of $32.9 million from a stock purchase agreement with Amgen. In June 2013, in conjunction with the Amgen Agreement Amendment, we sold 1,404,100 shares of common stock to Amgen for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million. In December 2014, in connection with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we sold 2,040,816 shares of common stock to Astellas for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million.\nCollaboration Partners\nOn a cumulative basis through December 31, 2016, we have received $160.7 million in non-equity payments from Amgen, $169.1 million in non-equity payments from Astellas, and $54.5 million in non-equity payments from GSK, in each case related to our strategic alliances.\nOriginal Astellas Agreement\nIn June 2013, we entered into the Original Astellas Agreement (see Note 7, \u201cRelated Party Research and Development Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In July 2013, we received an\nupfront non-refundable license payment of $16.0 million in connection with the execution of the Original Astellas Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement we were eligible to potentially receive over $24.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the initial two years of the collaboration. In addition, the agreement also provided for payments for the achievement of pre-specified milestones relating to the joint research and development program.\n2014 Astellas Agreement\nIn December 2014, we entered into the 2014 Astellas Agreement, which superseded the Original Astellas Agreement (see Note 7, \u201cRelated Party Research and Development Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Under the terms of the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront license fee of $30.0 million in January 2015. In conjunction with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold 2,040,816 shares common stock to Astellas at a price per share of $4.90. The aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million was received in December 2014. We determined the fair value of the stock issued to Astellas to be $9.1 million. The excess of cash received over fair value of $0.9 million was deferred and will be recognized as revenue as services are performed over approximately 24 months.\nWe were eligible to potentially receive over $20.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the two years of the collaboration following execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement.\n2016 Astellas Amendment (Inclusion of ALS as an Added Indication and Option on Tirasemtiv)\nThe 2016 Amendment to the 2014 Astellas Agreement (\u201c2016 Astellas Amendment\u201d) became effective in September 2016 (collectively with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, the \u201cCurrent Astellas Agreement\u201d). Under the 2016 Astellas Amendment, we granted Astellas an option to enter into a pre-negotiated agreement for a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of tirasemtiv. If Astellas exercises the option, Astellas will receive exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for Astellas outside Cytokinetics' commercialization territory in North America, Europe and other select countries. In addition, the 2016 Astellas Amendment expands our collaboration with Astellas to include the development of CK-2127107 for the potential treatment of ALS, as well as other fast skeletal regulatory activators licensed to Astellas under the 2014 Astellas Agreement. Finally, the 2016 Astellas Amendment extends the existing joint research program focused on the discovery of additional next-generation skeletal muscle activators through 2017, including sponsored research at Cytokinetics.\nIn connection with the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment, we received a $15.0 million non-refundable option fee for the grant of the Option on Tirasemtiv. Prior to Astellas' exercise of the option, we will continue the development of tirasemtiv, including VITALITY-ALS, at our own expense to support regulatory approval in the U.S., EU and certain other jurisdictions and will retain the final decision making authority on the development of tirasemtiv. If Astellas exercises the option, we will grant Astellas an exclusive license to develop and commercialize tirasemtiv outside Cytokinetics' own commercialization territory of North America, Europe and other select countries. Each party would be primarily responsible for the further development of tirasemtiv in its territory and have the exclusive right to commercialize tirasemtiv in its territory.\nAlso in connection with the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment, we received a non-refundable upfront amendment fee of $35.0 million. We also received the accelerated payment of a $15.0 million milestone payment for the initiation of the first Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 as the lead compound in ALS that was otherwise provided for in the 2014 Astellas Agreement, as if such milestone had been achieved upon the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment. The parties will share equally the costs of developing CK-2127107 in ALS for the potential registration and marketing authorization in the U.S. and Europe, provided that (i) Astellas has agreed to solely fund Phase 2 development costs of CK-2127107 in ALS, subject to a right to recoup Cytokinetics' share of such costs plus a 100% premium by reducing future milestone and royalty\npayments to Cytokinetics, and (ii) Cytokinetics may defer (but not eliminate) a portion of its co-funding obligation for development activities after Phase 2 for up to 18 months, subject to certain conditions. Cytokinetics has the right to co-fund its share of such Phase 2 development costs on a current basis, in which case there would not be a premium due to Astellas. We are also eligible to receive up to approximately $41.8 million in additional sponsored research and development funding through 2018 which includes Astellas' funding of Cytokinetics' conduct of the Phase 2 clinical development of CK-2127107 in ALS (approximately $36.6 million) as well as the continuing research collaboration (approximately $5.2 million). In 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recognized revenue of $77.3 million, 26.1 million, and $42.2 million, respectively relating to the Current Astellas Agreement.\nUnder the Current Astellas Agreement, based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, Cytokinetics may receive over $600.0 million in milestone payments relating to the development and commercial launch of collaboration products, including up to $95.0 million relating to CK-2127107 in non-neuromuscular indications, and over $100.0 million in development and commercial launch milestones for CK-2127107 in each of SMA, ALS and other neuromuscular indications. Cytokinetics may also receive up to $200.0 million in payments for achievement of pre-specified sales milestones related to net sales of all collaboration products under the Current Astellas Agreement. If Astellas commercializes any collaboration products, Cytokinetics will also receive royalties on sales of such collaboration products, including royalties ranging from the high single digits to the high teens on sales of products containing CK-2127107. Cytokinetics can co-fund certain development costs for CK-2127107 and other compounds in exchange for increased milestone payments and royalties; such royalties may increase under certain scenarios to exceed twenty percent. In addition to the foregoing development, commercial launch and sales milestones, Cytokinetics may also receive payments for the achievement of pre-specified milestones relating to the joint research program.\nIf Astellas exercises its option for a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of tirasemtiv, Cytokinetics will receive an option exercise payment ranging from $25.0 million (if exercise occurs following receipt of data from the VITALITY-ALS trial) to $80.0 million (if exercise occurs following receipt of FDA approval) and a milestone payment of $30.0 million from Astellas associated with Cytokinetics' initiation of the open-label extension trial for tirasemtiv (VIGOR-ALS). Cytokinetics will be responsible for the development costs of tirasemtiv during the option period, but if Astellas' exercises the option after the defined review period following receipt of data from VITALITY-ALS, Astellas will at the time of option exercise reimburse Cytokinetics for a share of any additional costs incurred after such review period.\nIf Astellas exercises the option for tirasemtiv, the parties will share the future development costs of tirasemtiv in North America, Europe and certain other countries (with Cytokinetics bearing 75% of such shared costs and Astellas bearing 25% of such costs), and Astellas will be solely responsible for the development costs of tirasemtiv specific to its commercialization territory. Contingent upon the successful development of tirasemtiv, we may receive milestone payments up to $100.0 million for the initial indication and up to $50.0 million for each subsequent indication. If tirasemtiv is commercialized, Astellas will pay us royalties (at rates ranging from the mid-teens to twenty percent) on sales of tirasemtiv in Astellas' territory, and we will pay Astellas royalties (at rates up to the mid-teens) on sales of tirasemtiv in our commercialization territory, in each case subject to various possible adjustments.\nAmgen Agreement Amendment\nIn June 2013, we entered into the Amgen Agreement Amendment, which expanded our strategic alliance to include Japan (see Note 7, \u201cRelated Party Research and Development Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement Amendment, we received a non-refundable upfront license fee of $15 million in June 2013. In conjunction with the Amgen Agreement Amendment, we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold 1,404,100 shares common stock to Amgen at a price per share of $7.12. The aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million was received in June 2013. We determined the fair value of the stock issued to Amgen to be $7.5 million. The excess\nof cash received over fair value of $2.5 million was deferred and was recognized as revenue as services were performed over approximately 12 months.\nUnder the Amgen Agreement as amended, we are eligible for potential additional pre-commercialization and commercialization milestone payments of over $600.0 million in the aggregate on omecamtiv mecarbil and other potential products arising from research under the collaboration, and royalties that escalate based on increasing levels of annual net sales of products commercialized under the agreement. In December 2016, we provided notice of our initial exercise of our option to co-invest at the $10.0 million level in the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil in exchange for an incremental royalty from Amgen of up to 1% on increasing worldwide sales of omecamtiv mecarbil outside Japan. In February 2017, we agreed to increase our co-funding to $40 million, which will make us eligible to receive an incremental royalty of up to 4% on increasing worldwide sales of omecamtiv mecarbil outside of Japan and afford us the right to co-promote omecamtiv mecarbil in institutional care settings in North America, with reimbursement by Amgen for certain sales force activities.\nRoyalty Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2017, we entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement (\u201cRoyalty Agreement\u201d) with RPI Finance Trust (\u201cRPI\u201d), an entity related to Royalty Pharma. Under the Royalty Agreement, we sold a portion of our right to receive royalties on future net sales of omecamtiv mecarbil (and potentially other compounds with the same mechanism of action) under the Amgen Agreement (as amended) to RPI for a payment of $90.0 million and an investment in our common stock of $10.0 million pursuant to a concurrently executed Common Stock Purchase Agreement with RPI. See Note 15 - \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFebruary 2014 Public Offering\nOn February 25, 2014, we closed an underwritten public offering for the issuance and sale of 5,031,250 shares of our common stock. The gross proceeds from this public offering were $40.3 million and net proceeds were $37.5 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses.\nCantor Fitzgerald\nOn September 4, 2015, we entered into a $40.0 million Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement (\u201cCE Offering\u201d) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., pursuant to which we issue and sold, through December 31, 2016, 808,193 shares for total net proceeds of approximately $8.7 million. Through February 23, 2017, we issued and sold 993,408 shares for total net proceeds of approximately $11.0 million and $28.7 million remains available to us under the September 2015 Registration Statement.\nWarrants issued in June 2012 Public Offerings\nOn June 20, 2012, we entered into underwriting agreements for two separate, concurrent offerings of our securities (the \u201cJune 2012 Public Offerings\u201d). The warrants issued in the June 2012 Public Offerings became exercisable upon issuance and will remain exercisable until June 25, 2017. In August 2016, warrants to purchase 104,533 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.28 per share were exercised in accordance with the June 2012 Public Offerings underwriting agreements. In September 2016, we issued 690,580 shares of common stock related to cashless exercise of warrants. As of December 31, 2016, warrants to purchase 4,104,966 shares of our common stock were outstanding and exercisable.\nOctober 2015 Loan Agreement\nOn October 19, 2015 and February 10, 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) with Oxford Finance LLC (\u201cOxford,\u201d) as the collateral agent and a lender, and Silicon Valley Bank\n(\u201cSVB,\u201d) as a lender (Oxford and SVB collectively the \u201cLenders\u201d) to fund our working capital and other general corporate needs, for Term A and Term B, respectively. We can, in our sole discretion, draw down an additional $10.0 million under the Loan Agreement from the Lenders, at any time prior to March 31, 2017, subject to Cytokinetics' satisfaction of specified conditions precedent related to the earlier of (i) the occurrence of an equity even as described in the Loan Agreement, or (ii) specified results from VITALITY-ALS, the Company's Phase 3 trial of tirasemtiv, each as specified in the Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2016 we received $29.9 million from these loan and security agreements for Term A and Term B, net of issuance cost. Note 9, \u201cLong-Term Debt\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $163.9 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $111.6 million at December 31, 2015. The increase of $52.3 million was primarily due to the receipt of $65.0 million from Astellas in October 2016, receipt of a $26.7 million milestone payment from Amgen in December 2016, and net proceeds received from the Loan Agreement of $14.9 million and other net cash provided by operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $37.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 and was largely due to the receipt of $65.0 million from Astellas in October 2016, the receipt of a $26.7 million milestone payment from Amgen in December 2016, partially offset by cash used by operations due to the ongoing research and development activities, and general and administrative spend to support those activities. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 included non-cash stock based compensation of $7.1 million. At December 31, 2016, deferred revenue of $23.1 million related primarily to the deferral of revenue for Astellas' Option on Tirasemtiv.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 and was largely due to the receipt of $45.0 million from Astellas in January 2015, partially offset by cash used by operations due to the ongoing research and development activities. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 included non-cash stock based compensation of $4.6 million. At December 31, 2015, deferred revenue of $20.9 million related primarily to the deferral of revenue for Astellas based on the proportional performance model.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $44.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 and was largely due to the ongoing research and development activities and recognition of deferred revenue for which payment had been received in prior periods. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 included non-cash stock based compensation of $3.3 million. At December 31, 2014, deferred revenue of $33.6 million related largely to the deferral of revenue for Astellas based on the proportional performance model.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $52.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to purchases of investments of $145.2 million and purchases of property and equipment of $1.6 million, partially offset by cash proceeds from the maturities of investments of $94.6 million. Net cash provided by investing activities of $16.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to proceeds from the maturity of investments of $132.2 million which exceeded purchases of investments by $16.6 million, partially offset by cash used by investing activities for purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities of $4.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to purchases of investments, which exceeded proceeds from the maturity of investments by $2.9 million, and purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $16.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to net proceeds from the Loan Agreement of $14.9 million, proceeds from common stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $0.9 million, proceeds from common stock issuances from warrant exercises of $0.6 million, and net proceeds from issuances of restricted stock to employees and\nemployee stock option exercises of $0.4 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $23.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to net proceeds from the Loan Agreement of $14.9 million, net proceeds pursuant to the CE Offering of $8.7 million, and net proceeds from issuances of restricted stock to employees and employee stock option exercises of $0.4 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $48.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 and primarily consisted of net proceeds of $37.5 million from the February 2014 public offering, net proceeds of $2.4 million from sales of our common stock pursuant to the MLV Agreement and proceeds of $9.1 million from the sale of common stock to Astellas.\nShelf Registration Statements\nIn November 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which was declared effective in December 2013 (the \u201cDecember 2013 Shelf\u201d). The December 2013 Shelf allowed us to issue common stock and preferred stock, and/or warrants to purchase any of such securities with a total value of up to $150.0 million. This shelf expired when the January 2017 Shelf became effective.\nIn September 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective in September 2015 (the \u201cSeptember 2015 Registration Statement\u201d) in conjunction with the CE Offering with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. Pursuant to the terms of the CE Offering we may offer and sell, from time to time through Cantor Fitzgerald, shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $40.0 million. As of December 31, 2016, 808,193 shares of common stock were sold pursuant the CE Offering for total net proceeds of approximately $8.7 million. As of February 23, 2017, $28.7 million remains available to us under the September 2015 Registration Statement.\nIn December 2016, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective in January 2017 (the \u201cJanuary 2017 Shelf\u201d). The January 2017 Shelf registered up to $200.0 million of our common stock and preferred stock, and/or warrants to purchase any of such securities. The specific terms any offering pursuant to under the January 2017 Shelf will be established at the time of such offering.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018-2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020-2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Beyond </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest obligation on long-term debt(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,431 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,563 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Co-investment option(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,744 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> For further discussion regarding long-term debt, see Note 9, \u201cLong-Term Debt\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td> Interest obligation on long-term debt has been calculated based on the interest rate applicable as of December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>(3) </td> <td> Our long-term commitment under operating lease relates to payments under our facility lease in South San Francisco, California, which expires in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>(4) </td> <td> In February 2017, the Company provided notice to Amgen of its further exercise of its co-invest option in the additional amount of $30.0 million (i.e. to fully co-invest $40.0 million) in the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil under the Amgen Agreement.

We plan to continue development of our fast skeletal troponin activator tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS. We plan to continue development of our fast skeletal troponin activator CK-2127107 for the potential treatment of SMA, COPD, ALS and potentially other diseases and conditions related to skeletal muscle weakness or wasting and research of potential next-generation compounds as part of our strategic alliance with Astellas. We plan to continue to support the development of our cardiac muscle myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure and the research of potential next-generation compounds as part of our strategic alliance with Amgen. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we advance the research and development of compounds from our other muscle biology programs through research to candidate selection.\nOur future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the initiation, progress, timing, scope and completion of preclinical research, non-clinical development, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC), and clinical trials for our drug candidates and other compounds;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> delays that may be caused by requirements of regulatory agencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Amgen's decisions with regard to funding of development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil or other compounds for the potential treatment of heart failure under our collaboration;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Astellas' decisions with regard to funding of development and commercialization of CK-2127107 or other skeletal muscle activators under our collaboration;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> our level of funding for the development of current or future drug candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the number of drug candidates we pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> our ability to establish and maintain selected strategic alliances required for the development of drug candidates and commercialization of our potential drugs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> our plans or ability to expand our drug development capabilities, including our capabilities to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> our plans or ability to engage third party manufacturers for our drug candidates and potential drugs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> our plans or ability to build or access sales and marketing capabilities and to achieve market acceptance for potential drugs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the expansion and advancement of our research programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the hiring of additional employees and consultants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the expansion of our facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the acquisition of technologies, products and other business opportunities that require financial commitments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> our revenues, if any, from successful development of our drug candidates and commercialization of potential drugs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $518.3 million since inception and there can be no assurance that we will attain profitability. We are subject to risks common to clinical-stage companies including, but not limited to, development of new drug candidates, dependence on key personnel, and the ability to obtain\nadditional capital as needed to fund our future plans. Our liquidity will be impaired if sufficient additional capital is not available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through sales of our common stock and convertible preferred stock, contract payments under our collaboration agreements, debt financing arrangements, grants and interest income. Until we achieve profitable operations, we intend to continue to fund operations through payments from strategic collaborations, additional sales of equity securities, grants and debt financings. We have never generated revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and may not have drugs to market for at least several years, if ever. Our success is dependent on our ability to obtain additional capital by entering into new strategic collaborations and/or through equity or debt financings, and ultimately on our and our collaborators' ability to successfully develop and market one or more of our drug candidates. We cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available from such collaborators or financings when needed or on satisfactory terms. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any of drugs based on our drug candidates will be accepted in the marketplace or that any future products can be developed or manufactured at an acceptable cost. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results, financial position and cash flows.\nBased on the current status of our development plans, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, investments and interest earned on investments will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. If, at any time, our prospects for internally financing our research and development programs decline, we may decide to reduce research and development expenses by delaying, discontinuing or reducing our funding of development of one or more of our drug candidates or of other research and development programs. Alternatively, we might raise funds through strategic relationships, public or private financings or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that funding, if needed, will be available on attractive terms, or at all, or in accordance with our planned timelines. Furthermore, financing obtained through future strategic relationships may require us to forego certain commercialization and other rights to our drug candidates. Similarly, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We review our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nInvestments\nAvailable-for-sale investments. Our investments consist of U.S. Treasury securities, and money market funds. We designate all investments as available-for-sale. Therefore, they are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 4, \u201cCash\nEquivalents and Investments\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detailed discussion. Investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term investments. The amortized cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are included in other income or expense. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in Interest and Other, net.\nOther-than-temporary impairment. All of our available-for-sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments below the cost basis is judged to be other-than-temporary. Factors considered by management in assessing whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred include: the nature of the investment; whether the decline in fair value is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting the investment; the financial condition of the investee; the severity and the duration of the impairment; and whether we have the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity. When we determine that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the investment is written down to its market value at the end of the period in which we determine that an other-than-temporary decline occurred.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for research performed and milestones met, and the collectability of those fees. Should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected.\nRevenue under our license and collaboration arrangements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract. Research and development revenues, which are earned under agreements with third parties for agreed research and development activities, may include non-refundable license fees, research and development funding, cost reimbursements and contingent milestones and royalties. The Company's collaborations prior to January 1, 2011 with multiple elements were evaluated and divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the customer and whether there was vendor-specific objective and reliable evidence (\u201cVSOE\u201d) of the fair value of the undelivered items. The consideration the Company received was allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria were applied to each of the separate units. The consideration the Company received was combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting when criteria for separation were not met. On January 1, 2011, ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Element Arrangements (\u201cASC 605-25\u201d) on the recognition of revenues for agreements with multiple deliverables became effective and applies to any agreements the Company entered into on or after January 1, 2011. Under this updated guidance, revenue is allocated to each element using a selling price hierarchy, where the selling price for an element is based on VSOE if available; third-party evidence (\u201cTPE\u201d), if available and VSOE is not available; or the best estimate of selling price, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nUpfront, non-refundable licensing payments are assessed to determine whether or not the licensee is able to obtain stand-alone value from the license. Where the license does not have stand-alone value, non-refundable license fees are recognized as revenue as we perform under the applicable agreement. Where the level of effort is relatively consistent over the performance period, we recognize total fixed or determined revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of expected performance. Where the license has stand-alone value, we recognize total license revenue at the time all revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nAlso on January 1, 2011, ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition - Milestone Method (\u201cASC 605-28\u201d) became effective and established the milestone method as an acceptable method of revenue recognition for certain contingent event-based payments under research and development arrangements. Under the milestone method, a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. A milestone is an event (i) that can be achieved based in whole or in part on either our performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance, (ii) for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved, and (iii) that would result in additional payments being due to us. The determination that a milestone is substantive is based on management's judgment and is made at the inception of the arrangement. Milestones are considered substantive when the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is (i) commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (ii) relates solely to past performance and (iii) is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement.\nOther contingent event-based payments received for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the results of a collaborative partner's performance are not considered milestones under ASC 605-28. Such payments will be recognized as revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) price is fixed or determinable, (iv) and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe account for milestone payments under the provisions of ASC 605-28. We consider an event to be a milestone if there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved, if the event can only be achieved with our performance, and if the achievement of the event results in payment to us. If we determine a milestone is substantive, we recognize revenue when payment is earned and becomes payable. For a milestone to be considered substantive, it must be achieved with our performance, be reasonable relative to the terms of the arrangement and be commensurate with our effort to achieve the milestone or commensurate with the enhanced value of the delivered item(s) as a result of the milestone achievement. If we determine a milestone is not substantive, we defer the payment and recognize revenue over the estimated period of performance as we complete our performance obligations, if any.\nResearch and development revenues and cost reimbursements are based upon negotiated rates for our FTEs and actual out-of-pocket costs. FTE rates are negotiated rates that are based upon our costs, and which we believe approximate fair value. Any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue. None of the revenues recognized to date are refundable if the relevant research effort is not successful. In revenue arrangements in which both parties make payments to each other, we evaluate the payments to determine whether payments made by us will be recognized as a reduction of revenue or as expense. Revenue we recognize may be reduced by payments made to the other party under the arrangement unless we receive a separate and identifiable benefit in exchange for the payments and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received. In arrangements in which we are the primary obligor, we record expense reimbursements from the other party as research and development revenue. If we are not the primary obligor, we record payments as a reduction of revenue.\nFunds received from third parties under grant arrangements are recorded as revenue if we are deemed to be the principal participant in the grant arrangement as the activities under the grant are part of our development programs. If we are not the principal participant, the grant funds are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense. Grant funds received are not refundable and are recognized when the related qualified research and development costs are incurred and when there is reasonable assurance that the funds will be received. Funds received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue.\nPreclinical Study and Clinical Trial Accruals\nA substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed utilizing third-party contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and other vendors. For preclinical studies, the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the percentage of work completed to date and contract milestones achieved. For clinical trial expenses, the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled, duration of enrollment and percentage of work completed to date. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews, correspondence and status meetings with CROs and review of contractual terms. Our estimates are dependent on the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by our CROs and other vendors. If we have incomplete or inaccurate data, we may under- or overestimate activity levels associated with various studies or clinical trials at a given point in time. In this event, we could record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity levels become known.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe apply the accounting guidance for stock compensation, which establishes the accounting for share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options and employee stock purchases. Under this guidance, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the award.\nUnder the guidance for stock compensation for non-employees, we measure the fair value of the award each period until the award is fully vested. Compensation cost for restricted stock awards that contain performance conditions is based on the grant date fair value of the award and compensation expense is recorded over the implicit or explicit requisite service period based on management's best estimate as to whether it is probable that the shares awarded are expected to vest.\nAs required under the accounting rules, we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and, as a result, from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates at the time, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if conditions change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We did not record an income tax provision in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014 because we either had net taxable losses in these periods or was able to utilize tax attributes to offset taxable income.\nBased upon the weight of available evidence, which includes our historical operating performance, reported cumulative net losses since inception, expected future losses, and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results, we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The valuation allowance was determined pursuant to the accounting guidance for income taxes, which\nrequires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance decreased by $2.2 million in 2016 and increased by $13.9 million in 2015 and $1.0 million in 2014.\nWe also follow the accounting guidance that defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position. If the recognition threshold is met, the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized.\nInterest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties was zero for 2016, 2015 and 2014. We account for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties by classifying both as income tax expense in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change materially over the next twelve months.\nThe significant jurisdictions in which we file income tax returns are the United States and the state of California. For jurisdictions in which tax filings are made, we are subject to income tax examination for all fiscal years since inception. The IRS's Large Business and International Division concluded its audit of the 2009 tax year with no material adjustments. However, in general, the statute of limitations for tax liabilities for these years remains open for the purpose of adjusting the amounts of the losses and credits carried forward from those years. We believe that we maintain adequate reserves for uncertain tax positions.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u2018ownership change' is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and tax credits to offset future taxable income. We have performed a Section 382 analysis and do not believe that we have experienced an ownership change since 2006. A portion of our existing NOLs and tax credits are subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 and result in additional limitations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 1, \u201cOrganization and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a

"item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. Operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 as Cytokinetics, Incorporated. We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of first-in-class muscle activators as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which muscle performance is compromised and/or declining. Our research and development activities relating to the biology of muscle function have evolved from our knowledge and expertise regarding the cytoskeleton, a complex biological infrastructure that plays a fundamental role within every human cell. Our most advanced research and development programs relate to the biology of muscle function and are directed to small molecule modulators of the contractility of skeletal or cardiac muscle. We are also conducting earlier-stage research directed to other compounds with the potential to modulate muscle contractility and other muscle functions, such as growth, energetics and metabolism.\nOur drug candidates currently in clinical development are our fast skeletal troponin activators tirasemtiv and CK-2127107, and our cardiac muscle activator omecamtiv mecarbil. Tirasemtiv is being evaluated for the\npotential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\u201cALS\u201d). CK-2127107 is being evaluated for the potential treatment of spinal muscle atrophy (\u201cSMA\u201d) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\u201cCOPD\u201d) and for potential use in other indications associated with muscle weakness (including ALS) under a strategic alliance with Astellas Pharma Inc. (\u201cAstellas\u201d) established in 2013 and expanded in 2014 and 2016. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being evaluated for the potential treatment of heart failure under a strategic alliance with Amgen established in 2006.\nMuscle Contractility Programs\nSkeletal Muscle Contractility Program\nTirasemtiv is our lead drug candidate from this program. We retain exclusive rights to tirasemtiv, subject to Astellas' exercise of its option for a license to tirasemtiv (see \u201cAstellas' Option on Tirasemtiv\u201d below). We conducted a Phase 2 clinical development program for tirasemtiv, and we started a Phase 3 clinical development program for this drug candidate in patients with ALS in July 2015 known as VITALITY-ALS (Ventilatory Investigation of Tirasemtiv and Assessment of Longitudinal Indices after Treatment for a Year in ALS). Tirasemtiv has been granted orphan drug designation and fast track status by the FDA and orphan medicinal product designation by the European Medicines Agency, in each case for the potential treatment of ALS.\nIn collaboration with Astellas, we are also developing another drug candidate from this program, CK-2127107, for potential indications associated with muscle weakness. We started a Phase 2 clinical trial for CK-2127107 in patients with SMA in December 2015. Astellas, in collaboration with Cytokinetics, started a Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with COPD in June 2016. Tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 are structurally distinct and selective small molecules that activate the fast skeletal troponin complex in the sarcomere by increasing its sensitivity to calcium, leading to an increase in skeletal muscle contractility. Each of tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 has demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models and evidence of potentially clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effects in humans. We are evaluating other potential indications for which tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 may be useful.\nTirasemtiv\nFurther details regarding tirasemtiv and VITALITY-ALS can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Skeletal Muscle Contractility Program - Tirasemtiv.\u201d\nThe clinical trials program for tirasemtiv may proceed for several years, and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved, and the drug is commercialized. Tirasemtiv is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur. Our expenditures are expected to increase as we continue to progress tirasemtiv towards potential registration.\nCK-2127107 and Other Skeletal Muscle Activators\nAstellas Strategic Alliance. CK-2127107 is being developed jointly by Cytokinetics and Astellas.\nIn July 2016, we entered into the 2016 Astellas Amendment collectively with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, the \u201cCurrent Astellas Agreement.\u201d\nAstellas holds an exclusive license to develop and commercialize CK-2127107 worldwide, subject to our development and commercialization participation rights. Under this strategic alliance, Cytokinetics conducted five Phase 1 clinical trials of CK-2127107 and started a Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (\u201cSMA\u201d) in December 2015. CK-2127107 is also being evaluated for the potential use in other indications associated with muscle weakness. Astellas, in collaboration with Cytokinetics, started a Phase 2\nclinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with COPD in June 2016 and we anticipate Astellas will initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial of CK-2127107 in elderly patients with limited mobility in the first half of 2017. We are also conducting joint research with Astellas directed to next-generation skeletal muscle activators.\nFurther details regarding our strategic alliance with Astellas can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Skeletal Muscle Contractility Program - CK-2127107 and Other Skeletal Muscle Activators - Astellas Strategic Alliance.\u201d\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company recorded license revenue of $62.2 million, $13.9 million and $9.8 million respectively, reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities of $13.1 million, $12.2 million, and $15.4 million, respectively, and milestone revenues of $2.0 million, zero and $17.0 million, in connection with our strategic alliance with Astellas. Refer to Note 7, \u201cRelated Parties and Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the accounting treatment, including the allocation of consideration to the units of accounting, and the revenue recognition of License Revenue and Research and Development Revenue, under the 2016 Astellas Amendment.\nThe clinical trials programs for CK-2127107 may proceed for several years, and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved, and the drug is commercialized. CK-2127107 is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur. Our expenditures will increase if Astellas terminates development of CK-2127107 or related compounds and we elect to develop them independently, or if we conduct early-stage development for certain agreed indications at our initial expense, subject to reimbursement if development continues under the collaboration.\nOngoing Research in Skeletal Muscle Activators.\nOur research on the direct activation of skeletal muscle continues in two areas. We are conducting translational research in preclinical models of disease and muscle function with fast skeletal troponin activators to explore the potential clinical applications of this novel mechanism in diseases or conditions associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction. We also intend to conduct preclinical research on other chemically and pharmacologically distinct mechanisms to activate the skeletal sarcomere. We advanced a next generation skeletal muscle activator into IND-enabling studies in 2016 and earned a $2.0 million milestone payment. We are conducting a joint research program with Astellas directed to the discovery of next-generation skeletal muscle activators. Under the 2016 Astellas Amendment, the joint research program will continue through 2017 and Astellas will reimburse us for certain research activities.\nResearch and Development Expenses. We recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our skeletal muscle contractility program of approximately $53.7 million, $36.3 million and $32.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recognized research and development revenue from Astellas of $15.1 million, $12.2 million, and $32.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, consisting of milestone payments, and reimbursements of full-time employee equivalents (\u201cFTEs\u201d) and other expenses. We anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our skeletal muscle contractility program will increase significantly if and as we advance tirasemtiv, CK-2127107 or other compounds from this program into and through development.\nCardiac Muscle Contractility Program\nOur lead drug candidate from our cardiac muscle contractility program, omecamtiv mecarbil (formerly known as CK-1827452), is a novel cardiac muscle myosin activator that is being developed under a strategic alliance with Amgen. In June 2013, we expanded this collaboration to include Japan. As a result, Amgen holds an exclusive, worldwide license to omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds, subject to Cytokinetics'\nspecified development and commercialization rights. Amgen has also entered an alliance with Servier for exclusive commercialization rights in Europe as well as the Commonwealth of Independent States (\u201cCIS\u201d), including Russia. In December 2016, we announced the activation of the first trial site for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil being conducted by Amgen in collaboration with Cytokinetics, GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure). We are continuing our joint research with Amgen directed to next-generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program in 2017.\nFurther details regarding our strategic alliance with Amgen can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Cardiac Muscle Contractility Program - Amgen Strategic Alliance.\u201d\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $1.2 million, $2.5 million and $4.5 million, respectively, in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities, respectively and milestone revenues of $26.7 million, zero and zero, relating to the Amgen Agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded zero license revenue under the Amgen Agreement. See our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policy under our agreement with Amgen. Refer to Note 7, \u201cRelated Parties and Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the accounting treatment, under the Amgen agreement.\nOmecamtiv Mecarbil Clinical Development\nGALACTIC-HF is a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil which is being conducted by Amgen, in collaboration with Cytokinetics. Coincident with the start of the trial, Amgen made a $26.7 million milestone payment to Cytokinetics in December 2016. The primary objective of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial is to determine if treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil when added to standard of care is superior to standard of care plus placebo in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure events in patients with high risk chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. GALACTIC-HF will be conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (\u201cSPA\u201d) with the U.S. FDA. GALACTIC-HF is planned to enroll approximately 8,000 symptomatic chronic heart failure patients in over 800 sites in 34 countries who are either currently hospitalized for a primary reason of heart failure or have had a hospitalization or admission to an emergency room for heart failure within one year prior to screening. In order to be eligible to participate in GALACTIC-HF patients should have an LVEF \u00a3 35%, be NYHA class II to IV, and have an elevated BNP or NT-proBNP. Patients will be randomized to either placebo or omecamtiv mecarbil with dose titration up to a maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily based on the plasma concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil after initiation of drug therapy. The primary endpoint is a composite of time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure event, which is defined as either a hospitalization for heart failure or other urgent treatment for worsening heart failure. Secondary endpoints include time to cardiovascular death; patient reported outcomes as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score; time to first heart failure hospitalization; and all-cause death.\nCytokinetics and Amgen are also planning a potential exercise performance/cardiac function clinical trial to be conducted by Cytokinetics. Amgen will be responsible for reimbursing us for the out-of-pocket development costs associated with this clinical trial.\nFurther details regarding the clinical development of omecamtiv mecarbil can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Cardiac Muscle Contractility Program - Omecamtiv Mecarbil\u201d\nOngoing Research in Cardiac Muscle Contractility. We continued our joint research program with Amgen directed to next-generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program in 2016. We expect to continue our joint research program with Amgen into 2017. Under the Amgen Agreement, Amgen will reimburse us for certain research activities we perform.\nThe clinical trials program for omecamtiv mecarbil may proceed for several years, and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved, and the drug is commercialized. Omecamtiv mecarbil is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur. We funded all research and development costs associated with this program prior to Amgen's option exercise in May 2009. We anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program will increase if we participate in the future advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil through clinical development. Our expenditures will also increase if Amgen terminates development of omecamtiv mecarbil or related compounds and we elect to develop them independently, or if we elect to co-fund later-stage development of omecamtiv mecarbil or other compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration and option agreement with Amgen.\nResearch and Development Expenses. We recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our cardiac muscle contractility program of approximately $8.1 million, $5.8 million and $7.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recognized net research and development revenue from Amgen of $1.2 million, $2.5 million and $4.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, consisting of reimbursements of FTEs and other expenses offset by a payment related to Cytokinetics' option to co-fund the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil for an increased royalty percentage. We anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program will increase if we participate in the future advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil through clinical development. We also anticipate incurring future payments related to the co-investment option for which we provided notice of exercise in 2016 that will be offset against research and development revenues.\nBeyond Muscle Contractility\nWe have developed preclinical expertise in the mechanics of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle that extends from proteins to tissues to intact animal models. Our translational research in muscle contractility has enabled us to better understand the potential impact of small molecule compounds that increase skeletal or cardiac muscle contractility and to apply those findings to the further evaluation of our drug candidates in clinical populations. In addition to contractility, the other major functions of muscle play a role in certain diseases that could benefit from novel mechanism treatments. Accordingly, our knowledge of muscle contractility may serve as an entry point to the discovery of novel treatments for disorders involving muscle functions other than muscle contractility. We are leveraging our current understandings of muscle biology to investigate new ways of modulating these other aspects of muscle function for other potential therapeutic applications.\nDevelopment Risks\nThe successful development of any of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. We cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature, timing and costs of the activities necessary to complete the development of any of our drug candidates or the date of completion of these development activities due to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 the results of clinical trials of our drug candidates conducted by us or our partners may not support the further clinical development of those drug candidates; \n \u2022 further clinical development of tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS will require significant additional funding and we may be unable to obtain such additional funding on acceptable terms, if at all; \n \u2022 the FDA and/or other regulatory authorities may not accept effects on respiratory function, including SVC, as appropriate clinical trial endpoints to support the registration of tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS; \n \u2022 the FDA and/or other regulatory authorities may not accept the data from the clinical trials of tirasemtiv as sufficient to determine the safest and most effective dose of tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS; \n \u2022 decisions made by Amgen with respect to the development of omecamtiv mecarbil and by Astellas with respect to the development of CK-2127107; \n \u2022 the uncertainty of the timing of the initiation and completion of patient enrollment and treatment in our or our partners' clinical trials; \n \u2022 the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing of the analyses of our clinical trial data after these trials have been initiated and completed; \n \u2022 our potential inability to obtain additional funding and resources for our development activities on acceptable terms, if at all, including, but not limited to, our potential inability to obtain or retain partners to assist in the design, management, conduct and funding of clinical trials; \n \u2022 failure by our clinical trial sites, clinical research organizations, clinical manufacturing organizations and other third parties supporting our or our partners' clinical trials to fulfill their obligations or otherwise perform as expected; \n \u2022 delays or additional costs in manufacturing of our drug candidates for clinical trial use, including developing appropriate formulations of our drug candidates; \n \u2022 the uncertainty of clinical trial results, including variability in patient response; \n \u2022 the uncertainty of obtaining FDA or other foreign regulatory agency approval required for the clinical investigation of our drug candidates; \n \u2022 the uncertainty related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing processes and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing facility; \n \u2022 the possibility that results from non-clinical studies may adversely impact the timing or further development of our drug candidates; and \n \u2022 possible delays in the characterization, formulation and manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of drug candidates and other compounds.  If we fail to complete the development of any of our drug candidates in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and liquidity. In addition, any failure by us or our partners to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our programs as planned, or at all, and certain consequences of failing to do so are discussed further in the risk factors entitled \u201cWe will need substantial additional capital in the future to sufficiently fund our operations,\u201d \u201cWe have never generated, and may never generate, revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and we may not have drugs to market for at least several years, if ever,\u201d \u201cClinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay completion of clinical development and regulatory approval\u201d and \u201cClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and subject to delay,\u201d and other risk factors.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenues\nOur current revenue sources are limited, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for several years, if at all. We have recognized revenues from our strategic alliances with Amgen, Astellas, and MyoKardia, Inc. (\u201cMyoKardia\u201d) and grant revenues from The ALS Association (the \u201cALSA\u201d).\nThe following table summarizes the sources of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as follows (in thousands):\n Astellas\nIn June 2013, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Astellas (the \u201cOriginal Astellas Agreement\u201d), that was amended and restated in December 2014 (the \u201c2014 Astellas Agreement\u201d).\nRefer to Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Skeletal Muscle Contractility Program - CK-2127107 - Astellas Strategic Alliance\u201d for further details regarding the collaboration agreements.\nIn July 2013, we received an upfront payment of $16.0 million in connection with the execution of the Original Astellas Agreement. The Original Astellas Agreement provided for us to potentially receive over $24.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the initial two years of the collaboration and for research and early and late stage development milestone payments based on various research and clinical milestones. We determined the license and the research and development services relating to the Original Astellas Agreement are a single unit of accounting as the license was determined to not have stand-alone value. Accordingly, we are recognizing this revenue using the proportional performance model. During 2014, revenue from reimbursement of research and development activities also included $2.0 million in research and development milestone fees and $15.0 million in milestone fees in connection with the decision made by Astellas to advance CK-2127107 into Phase 2 clinical development.\nIn January 2015, we received an upfront license fee payment of $30.0 million in connection with the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement. Also, in conjunction with the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold 2,040,816 shares of our common stock to Astellas at a price per share of $4.90. The aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million was received in December 2014. We determined the fair value of the stock issued to Astellas to be $9.1 million. The $0.9 million excess of cash received over fair value of was deferred and will be recognized as revenue as services are performed over approximately 24 months. We determined that the license and the research and development services relating to the 2014 Astellas Agreement are a single unit of accounting as the license was determined to not have stand-alone value. Accordingly, we are recognizing this revenue using the proportional performance model over the initial research term of the 2014 Astellas Agreement.\nConcurrently with the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement and related common stock purchase agreement, we received $15.0 million as a milestone payment relating to Astellas' decision to advance CK-2127107 into Phase 2 clinical development. We were also eligible to potentially receive over $20.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the two years of the collaboration following the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement.\nIn 2016, Cytokinetics and Astellas further amended the collaboration agreement to expand the collaboration to include the development of CK-2127107 (\u201c2016 Astellas Amendment\u201d) for the potential treatment of ALS, as well as the possible development in ALS of other fast skeletal regulatory activators previously licensed by Cytokinetics to Astellas. The 2016 Astellas Amendment became effective in September 2016. In connection with the 2016 Astellas Amendment, we received a non-refundable upfront amendment fee of $35.0 million. In addition, we received the accelerated payment of a $15.0 million milestone for the initiation of the first Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 as the lead compound in ALS that was otherwise provided for in the 2014 Astellas Agreement, as if such milestone had been achieved upon the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment. We determined that the ALS license and the additional research and development services relating to the 2016 Astellas Amendment each have stand-alone value. We have recognized $50.0 million license revenue related to the ALS license on the effective date of the arrangement while the allocated consideration for the research and development services will be recognized over the development term on a proportional basis. During 2016, revenue from reimbursement of research and development activities also included $2.0 million in research and development milestone fees.\nRefer to Note 7, \u201cRelated Parties and Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the accounting treatment under this collaboration agreement.\nUnder the Current Astellas Agreement, additional research and early and late state development milestone payments which are based on various research and clinical milestones, including the initiation of certain clinical studies, the submission for approval of a drug candidate to certain regulatory authorities for marketing approval and the commercial launch of collaboration products could total over $600.0 million, including up to $95.0 million relating to CK-2127107 in non-neuromuscular indications, and over $100.0 million related to CK-2127107 in each of SMA and other neuromuscular indications. Additionally, $200.0 million in commercial milestones could be received under the Current Astellas Agreement provided certain sales targets are met. Due to the nature of drug development, including the inherent risk of development and approval of drug candidates by regulatory authorities, it is not possible to estimate if and when these milestone payments could become due.\nIn the event Astellas commercializes any collaboration products, the Company will receive royalties on sales of such collaboration products, including royalties ranging from the high single digits to the high teens on sales of products containing CK-2127107. We can co-fund certain development costs for CK-2127107 and other compounds in exchange for increased milestone payments and royalties; such royalties may increase under certain scenarios to exceed twenty percent. Under the Current Astellas Agreement, we retain an option to co-promote collaboration products containing fast skeletal troponin activators for neuromuscular indications in the U.S., Canada and Europe, in addition to its option to co-promote other collaboration products in the U.S. and Canada as provided for in the Original Astellas Agreement. Astellas will reimburse us for certain expenses associated with its co-promotion activities.\nIn connection with the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment, the Company received a $15.0 million non-refundable option fee for the grant of the Option on Tirasemtiv in October 2016. Prior to Astellas' exercise of the option, the Company will continue the development of tirasemtiv, including the VITALITY-ALS trial, at its own expense to support regulatory approval in the U.S., EU and certain other jurisdictions and will retain the final decision making authority on the development of tirasemtiv.\nAmgen\nIn June 2013, we and Amgen executed an amendment (the \u201cAmgen Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Amgen Agreement to include Japan, resulting in a worldwide collaboration.\nFurther details regarding our strategic alliance with Amgen can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Cardiac Muscle Contractility Program - Amgen Strategic Alliance.\u201d\nWe have received reimbursements from Amgen for certain research and development activities during 2016, 2015 and 2014, which we recorded as revenue as the related expenses were incurred. We may be eligible to receive further reimbursements from Amgen for certain research and development activities, which we will record as revenue if and when the related expenses are incurred. We record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue. Revenues related to the reimbursement of FTEs were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our FTEs.\nRefer to Note 7, \u201cRelated Parties and Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the accounting treatment under this collaboration agreement.\nUnder the Amgen Agreement, as amended, the Company is eligible to receive over $300.0 million in additional development milestone payments which are based on various clinical milestones, including the initiation of certain clinical studies, the submission of a drug candidate to certain regulatory authorities for marketing approval and the receipt of such approvals. Additionally, the Company is eligible to receive up to $300.0 million in commercial milestone payments provided certain sales targets are met. Due to the nature of drug development, including the inherent risk of development and approval of drug candidates by regulatory authorities, it is not possible to estimate if and when these milestone payments would become due. The achievement of each of these milestones is dependent solely upon the results of Amgen's development and commercialization activities and therefore none of these milestones was deemed to be substantive.\nIn December 2016, we received a $26.7 million milestone payment from Amgen coincident with the start of GALACTIC-HF. The $26.7 million milestone payment from Amgen was recognized as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recognized no revenue for milestones achieved under the Amgen Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Also in December 2016, we provided notice of our exercise of our option to co-invest in the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil in exchange for increased royalties from Amgen on worldwide sales of omecamtiv mecarbil outside Japan.\nMyoKardia\nIn August 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with MyoKardia. Under an agreed research plan, scientists from MyoKardia and our FTEs conducted research focused on small molecule therapeutics that inhibit cardiac sarcomere proteins. We provided MyoKardia access to certain research facilities, and provided FTEs and other resources at agreed reimbursement rates that approximated our costs. We were the primary obligor in the collaboration arrangement, and accordingly, we recorded expense reimbursements from MyoKardia as research and development revenue. The research plan ended as planned in August 2013. In October 2016, we received a $0.2 million milestone payment from MyoKardia for the initiation of first Phase IIa clinical trial.\nALSA Grant\nIn July 2015, we were awarded a $1.5 million grant from The ALS Association (the \u201cALSA Grant\u201d) to support the conduct of VITALITY-ALS as well as the collection of clinical data and plasma samples from patients in VITALITY-ALS in order to help advance the discovery of potentially useful biomarkers in ALS. The grant provides funding for collaboration among Cytokinetics, The ALS Association and the Barrow Neurological Institute to enable plasma samples collected from patients enrolled in VITALITY-ALS to be added to The Northeastern ALS Consortium (NEALS) Repository, a resource for the academic research community to identify biomarkers that may help to assess disease progression and underlying disease mechanisms in ALS. In August 2015, we achieved the first milestone under the ALSA Grant which triggered a payment of $0.5 million in accordance with the ALSA Grant and in 2016, we achieved a second milestone which triggered a payment of $0.3 million in accordance with the ALSA Grant. We recorded grant revenue as qualified expenses were incurred and approved by management.\nBecause a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and other pre-commercialization milestones under our strategic alliances with Amgen and Astellas, our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year.\nIf one or more of our drug candidates is approved for sale as a drug, we expect that our future revenues will most likely be derived from royalties on sales from drugs licensed to Amgen and Astellas under our respective strategic alliances and from those licensed to future partners, and from direct sales of our drugs.\nResearch and Development\nWe incur research and development expenses associated with both partnered and our own research activities. We expect to incur research and development expenses for the clinical development of tirasemtiv. We expect to incur research and development expenses for CK-2127107 in accordance with agreed upon research and development plans with Astellas. We expect to incur research and development expenses for omecamtiv mecarbil and other next-generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program in accordance with agreed upon research and development plans with Amgen.\nResearch and development expenses related to any development and commercialization activities we elect to fund consist primarily of employee compensation, supplies and materials, costs for consultants and contract research and manufacturing, facilities costs and depreciation of equipment.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions, including, but not limited to, finance, human resources, legal, business and commercial development and strategic planning. Other significant costs include facilities costs, consulting costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and regulatory compliance.\nStock Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation related to stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchases for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n As of December 31, 2016, there was $8.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years and $3.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units, including the performance stock units (PSU's), which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years.\nResults of Operations\nYears ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nRevenues\n Research and development revenues from related parties refers to research and development revenues from our strategic alliances with Astellas and Amgen. Revenues from Astellas, which became a related party in December 2014, were $15.1 million, $12.2 million, and $15.0 million for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and consisted of reimbursements of internal costs for certain full-time employee equivalents, and other research and development expenses. Revenues from Astellas in 2016 and 2014 included $2.0 million and $15.0 million in milestone revenues, respectively. All research and development revenues from Astellas, prior to it becoming a related party are classified in research and development, grant and other revenues. Revenues from Amgen were $27.9 million, $2.5 million and $4.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenue from Amgen in 2016 included $26.7 million in a milestone payment, and $0.6 million in reimbursement of internal costs for certain full-time employee equivalents, partially offset by a payment of $1.3 million related to the option to co-fund Phase 3 development of omecamtiv mecarbil for an increased royalty percentage. Revenue from Amgen in 2015 and 2014 consisted of reimbursement of internal costs for certain full-time employee equivalents, and recognition of allocated consideration relating to the Amgen Agreement Amendment.\nResearch and development, grant and other revenues in 2016 and 2015 consisted primarily of $1.1 million and $0.1 million of research and development revenues from our collaboration with ALSA, respectively. Research and development, grant and other revenues in 2014 consisted primarily of revenues from our strategic alliance with Astellas, prior to becoming a related party in December 2014, including $15.4 million of research and development reimbursement revenues and $2.0 million in milestone revenues from our collaboration with Astellas, as well as $0.1 million in revenue from our collaboration with MyoKardia.\nLicense revenues from related parties refers to license revenues from our strategic alliances with Astellas and Amgen. License revenues from Astellas, which became a related party in December 2014, were $62.2 million and $13.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. License revenue from Astellas in 2016 consisted of the recognition of the $50.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas under the 2016 Astellas Amendment, and the recognition of a portion of the $30.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas in January 2015. License revenue from Astellas in 2015 consisted of the recognition of a portion of the $30.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas in January 2015 and the recognition of a portion of the $16.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas in July 2013. The upfront license fees were recognized using the proportional performance model.\nLicense revenues refers to license revenues from our collaboration with Astellas, prior to it becoming a related party in December 2014. License revenues from Astellas included $9.8 million in 2014 of the $16.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas in July 2013 in connection with the execution of the Original Astellas Agreement. We recognized this revenue over the term of the research and development services using the proportional performance model.\nResearch and development expenses\n The increase in research and development expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $12.1 million in outsourced clinical costs, $4.5 million in personnel related expenses and non-cash stock compensation expense, and $0.8 million in outsourced research costs, partially offset by a decrease of $4.2 million in outsourced preclinical costs mainly associated with clinical manufacturing activities. The increase in outsourced clinical costs was comprised of an increase of $16.6 million in outsourced clinical costs mainly associated with VITALITY-ALS, offset by a $4.5 million litigation settlement in June 2016 from a contract research organization for BENEFIT-ALS. The increase in research and development expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million in outsourced preclinical costs, an increase of $1.8 million in personnel related expenses due to increased headcount, and an increase of $0.4 million in lab expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in outsourced clinical costs associated with the completion of BENEFIT-ALS in the second quarter of 2014.\nThe following presents our research and development expenses by program:\n From a program perspective, the $13.5 million increase in research and development spending in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increased spending of $12.9 million for our skeletal muscle contractility program, which included our skeletal muscle contractility program for tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS and the clinical program for CK-2127107 under our collaboration with Astellas, and a $2.3 million increase in our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration with Amgen, partially offset by decreased spending of $1.5 million in our other research and preclinical programs. The $2.0 million increase in research and development spending in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased spending of $3.4 million for our skeletal muscle contractility program, which included our skeletal muscle contractility program for tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS, and the clinical program for CK-2127107 under our collaboration with Astellas, and a $0.2 million increase in our other research and preclinical programs, partially offset by decreased spending of $1.6 million for our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration with Amgen.\nClinical development timelines, the likelihood of success and total completion costs vary significantly for each drug candidate and are difficult to estimate. We anticipate that we will determine on an ongoing basis which research and development programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program, taking into account the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate. The lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain and maintain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe expect our research and development expenditures to increase significantly in 2017 compared to 2016. We expect to continue the Phase 3 clinical development of our drug candidate tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS. Under our strategic alliance with Astellas, we expect to continue development of our drug candidate CK-2127107 for the potential treatment of SMA and potentially other diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness or wasting. Under our strategic alliance with Amgen, we expect to continue the Phase 3 development of our drug candidate omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n General and administrative expenses increased $8.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increased spending of $4.2 million in personnel-related expenses due to increased headcount and non-cash stock compensation expense, an increase of $1.7 million in corporate and patent legal fees, and an increase of $1.7 million in outsourced costs related to commercial development, grants and sponsorships, and accounting and finance and recruitment related costs. The increase of $2.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased spending of $1.4 million for personnel-related costs due to increased headcount and increased spending of $0.8 million for outside services mainly related to commercial development. We expect that general and administrative expenses in 2017 will increase significantly compared to 2016, mainly due to increased headcount.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily consisted of interest expense related to the loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank entered into in October 2015. Interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to interest expense related to the long-term debt obligations which commenced in fourth quarter 2015.\nInterest and Other Income, net\nInterest and other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, primarily consisted of interest income generated from the Company's cash, cash equivalents and investments. In 2016 and 2015, interest income also included net gains realized upon disposal of equipment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financial condition is summarized as follows:\n From August 5, 1997, our date of inception, through December 31, 2016, we funded our operations through the sale of equity securities, non-equity payments from collaborators, long term debt, capital equipment financings, grants and interest income. Due to our substantial research and development expenditures, we have generated significant operating losses since our inception. Our expenditures are primarily related to research and development activities. As of December 31, 2016, we had available cash, cash equivalents and investments of $163.9 million.\nEquity Securities\nWe have received net proceeds from the sale of equity securities of $500.0 million from August 5, 1997, the date of our inception, through December 31, 2016, excluding sales of equity to Amgen, Astellas, and GlaxoSmithKline (\u201cGSK\u201d). Included in these proceeds are $94.0 million received upon closing of the initial public offering of our common stock in May 2004. In connection with execution of our collaboration and license agreement with GSK in 2001, GSK made a $14.0 million equity investment in us. GSK made additional equity investments in us in 2003 and 2004 of $3.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. In January 2007, in connection with the execution of the Amgen Agreement, we received net proceeds of $32.9 million from a stock purchase agreement with Amgen. In June 2013, in conjunction with the Amgen Agreement Amendment, we sold 1,404,100 shares of common stock to Amgen for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million. In December 2014, in connection with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we sold 2,040,816 shares of common stock to Astellas for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million.\nCollaboration Partners\nOn a cumulative basis through December 31, 2016, we have received $160.7 million in non-equity payments from Amgen, $169.1 million in non-equity payments from Astellas, and $54.5 million in non-equity payments from GSK, in each case related to our strategic alliances.\nOriginal Astellas Agreement\nIn June 2013, we entered into the Original Astellas Agreement (see Note 7, \u201cRelated Party Research and Development Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In July 2013, we received an\nupfront non-refundable license payment of $16.0 million in connection with the execution of the Original Astellas Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement we were eligible to potentially receive over $24.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the initial two years of the collaboration. In addition, the agreement also provided for payments for the achievement of pre-specified milestones relating to the joint research and development program.\n2014 Astellas Agreement\nIn December 2014, we entered into the 2014 Astellas Agreement, which superseded the Original Astellas Agreement (see Note 7, \u201cRelated Party Research and Development Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Under the terms of the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront license fee of $30.0 million in January 2015. In conjunction with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold 2,040,816 shares common stock to Astellas at a price per share of $4.90. The aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million was received in December 2014. We determined the fair value of the stock issued to Astellas to be $9.1 million. The excess of cash received over fair value of $0.9 million was deferred and will be recognized as revenue as services are performed over approximately 24 months.\nWe were eligible to potentially receive over $20.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the two years of the collaboration following execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement.\n2016 Astellas Amendment (Inclusion of ALS as an Added Indication and Option on Tirasemtiv)\nThe 2016 Amendment to the 2014 Astellas Agreement (\u201c2016 Astellas Amendment\u201d) became effective in September 2016 (collectively with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, the \u201cCurrent Astellas Agreement\u201d). Under the 2016 Astellas Amendment, we granted Astellas an option to enter into a pre-negotiated agreement for a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of tirasemtiv. If Astellas exercises the option, Astellas will receive exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for Astellas outside Cytokinetics' commercialization territory in North America, Europe and other select countries. In addition, the 2016 Astellas Amendment expands our collaboration with Astellas to include the development of CK-2127107 for the potential treatment of ALS, as well as other fast skeletal regulatory activators licensed to Astellas under the 2014 Astellas Agreement. Finally, the 2016 Astellas Amendment extends the existing joint research program focused on the discovery of additional next-generation skeletal muscle activators through 2017, including sponsored research at Cytokinetics.\nIn connection with the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment, we received a $15.0 million non-refundable option fee for the grant of the Option on Tirasemtiv. Prior to Astellas' exercise of the option, we will continue the development of tirasemtiv, including VITALITY-ALS, at our own expense to support regulatory approval in the U.S., EU and certain other jurisdictions and will retain the final decision making authority on the development of tirasemtiv. If Astellas exercises the option, we will grant Astellas an exclusive license to develop and commercialize tirasemtiv outside Cytokinetics' own commercialization territory of North America, Europe and other select countries. Each party would be primarily responsible for the further development of tirasemtiv in its territory and have the exclusive right to commercialize tirasemtiv in its territory.\nAlso in connection with the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment, we received a non-refundable upfront amendment fee of $35.0 million. We also received the accelerated payment of a $15.0 million milestone payment for the initiation of the first Phase 2 clinical", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. Operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 as Cytokinetics, Incorporated. We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of first-in-class muscle activators as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which muscle performance is compromised and/or declining. Our research and development activities relating to the biology of muscle function have evolved from our knowledge and expertise regarding the cytoskeleton, a complex biological infrastructure that plays a fundamental role within every human cell. Our most advanced research and development programs relate to the biology of muscle function and are directed to small molecule modulators of the contractility of skeletal or cardiac muscle. We are also conducting earlier-stage research directed to other compounds with the potential to modulate muscle contractility and other muscle functions, such as growth, energetics and metabolism.\nOur drug candidates currently in clinical development are our fast skeletal troponin activators tirasemtiv and CK-2127107, and our cardiac muscle activator omecamtiv mecarbil. Tirasemtiv is being evaluated for the\npotential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\u201cALS\u201d). CK-2127107 is being evaluated for the potential treatment of spinal muscle atrophy (\u201cSMA\u201d) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\u201cCOPD\u201d) and for potential use in other indications associated with muscle weakness (including ALS) under a strategic alliance with Astellas Pharma Inc. (\u201cAstellas\u201d) established in 2013 and expanded in 2014 and 2016. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being evaluated for the potential treatment of heart failure under a strategic alliance with Amgen established in 2006.\nMuscle Contractility Programs\nSkeletal Muscle Contractility Program\nTirasemtiv is our lead drug candidate from this program. We retain exclusive rights to tirasemtiv, subject to Astellas' exercise of its option for a license to tirasemtiv (see \u201cAstellas' Option on Tirasemtiv\u201d below). We conducted a Phase 2 clinical development program for tirasemtiv, and we started a Phase 3 clinical development program for this drug candidate in patients with ALS in July 2015 known as VITALITY-ALS (Ventilatory Investigation of Tirasemtiv and Assessment of Longitudinal Indices after Treatment for a Year in ALS). Tirasemtiv has been granted orphan drug designation and fast track status by the FDA and orphan medicinal product designation by the European Medicines Agency, in each case for the potential treatment of ALS.\nIn collaboration with Astellas, we are also developing another drug candidate from this program, CK-2127107, for potential indications associated with muscle weakness. We started a Phase 2 clinical trial for CK-2127107 in patients with SMA in December 2015. Astellas, in collaboration with Cytokinetics, started a Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with COPD in June 2016. Tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 are structurally distinct and selective small molecules that activate the fast skeletal troponin complex in the sarcomere by increasing its sensitivity to calcium, leading to an increase in skeletal muscle contractility. Each of tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 has demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models and evidence of potentially clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effects in humans. We are evaluating other potential indications for which tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 may be useful.\nTirasemtiv\nFurther details regarding tirasemtiv and VITALITY-ALS can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Skeletal Muscle Contractility Program - Tirasemtiv.\u201d\nThe clinical trials program for tirasemtiv may proceed for several years, and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved, and the drug is commercialized. Tirasemtiv is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur. Our expenditures are expected to increase as we continue to progress tirasemtiv towards potential registration.\nCK-2127107 and Other Skeletal Muscle Activators\nAstellas Strategic Alliance. CK-2127107 is being developed jointly by Cytokinetics and Astellas.\nIn July 2016, we entered into the 2016 Astellas Amendment collectively with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, the \u201cCurrent Astellas Agreement.\u201d\nAstellas holds an exclusive license to develop and commercialize CK-2127107 worldwide, subject to our development and commercialization participation rights. Under this strategic alliance, Cytokinetics conducted five Phase 1 clinical trials of CK-2127107 and started a Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (\u201cSMA\u201d) in December 2015. CK-2127107 is also being evaluated for the potential use in other indications associated with muscle weakness. Astellas, in collaboration with Cytokinetics, started a Phase 2\nclinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with COPD in June 2016 and we anticipate Astellas will initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial of CK-2127107 in elderly patients with limited mobility in the first half of 2017. We are also conducting joint research with Astellas directed to next-generation skeletal muscle activators.\nFurther details regarding our strategic alliance with Astellas can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Skeletal Muscle Contractility Program - CK-2127107 and Other Skeletal Muscle Activators - Astellas Strategic Alliance.\u201d\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company recorded license revenue of $62.2 million, $13.9 million and $9.8 million respectively, reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities of $13.1 million, $12.2 million, and $15.4 million, respectively, and milestone revenues of $2.0 million, zero and $17.0 million, in connection with our strategic alliance with Astellas. Refer to Note 7, \u201cRelated Parties and Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the accounting treatment, including the allocation of consideration to the units of accounting, and the revenue recognition of License Revenue and Research and Development Revenue, under the 2016 Astellas Amendment.\nThe clinical trials programs for CK-2127107 may proceed for several years, and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved, and the drug is commercialized. CK-2127107 is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur. Our expenditures will increase if Astellas terminates development of CK-2127107 or related compounds and we elect to develop them independently, or if we conduct early-stage development for certain agreed indications at our initial expense, subject to reimbursement if development continues under the collaboration.\nOngoing Research in Skeletal Muscle Activators.\nOur research on the direct activation of skeletal muscle continues in two areas. We are conducting translational research in preclinical models of disease and muscle function with fast skeletal troponin activators to explore the potential clinical applications of this novel mechanism in diseases or conditions associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction. We also intend to conduct preclinical research on other chemically and pharmacologically distinct mechanisms to activate the skeletal sarcomere. We advanced a next generation skeletal muscle activator into IND-enabling studies in 2016 and earned a $2.0 million milestone payment. We are conducting a joint research program with Astellas directed to the discovery of next-generation skeletal muscle activators. Under the 2016 Astellas Amendment, the joint research program will continue through 2017 and Astellas will reimburse us for certain research activities.\nResearch and Development Expenses. We recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our skeletal muscle contractility program of approximately $53.7 million, $36.3 million and $32.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recognized research and development revenue from Astellas of $15.1 million, $12.2 million, and $32.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, consisting of milestone payments, and reimbursements of full-time employee equivalents (\u201cFTEs\u201d) and other expenses. We anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our skeletal muscle contractility program will increase significantly if and as we advance tirasemtiv, CK-2127107 or other compounds from this program into and through development.\nCardiac Muscle Contractility Program\nOur lead drug candidate from our cardiac muscle contractility program, omecamtiv mecarbil (formerly known as CK-1827452), is a novel cardiac muscle myosin activator that is being developed under a strategic alliance with Amgen. In June 2013, we expanded this collaboration to include Japan. As a result, Amgen holds an exclusive, worldwide license to omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds, subject to Cytokinetics'\nspecified development and commercialization rights. Amgen has also entered an alliance with Servier for exclusive commercialization rights in Europe as well as the Commonwealth of Independent States (\u201cCIS\u201d), including Russia. In December 2016, we announced the activation of the first trial site for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil being conducted by Amgen in collaboration with Cytokinetics, GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure). We are continuing our joint research with Amgen directed to next-generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program in 2017.\nFurther details regarding our strategic alliance with Amgen can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Cardiac Muscle Contractility Program - Amgen Strategic Alliance.\u201d\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $1.2 million, $2.5 million and $4.5 million, respectively, in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities, respectively and milestone revenues of $26.7 million, zero and zero, relating to the Amgen Agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded zero license revenue under the Amgen Agreement. See our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policy under our agreement with Amgen. Refer to Note 7, \u201cRelated Parties and Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the accounting treatment, under the Amgen agreement.\nOmecamtiv Mecarbil Clinical Development\nGALACTIC-HF is a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil which is being conducted by Amgen, in collaboration with Cytokinetics. Coincident with the start of the trial, Amgen made a $26.7 million milestone payment to Cytokinetics in December 2016. The primary objective of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial is to determine if treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil when added to standard of care is superior to standard of care plus placebo in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure events in patients with high risk chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. GALACTIC-HF will be conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (\u201cSPA\u201d) with the U.S. FDA. GALACTIC-HF is planned to enroll approximately 8,000 symptomatic chronic heart failure patients in over 800 sites in 34 countries who are either currently hospitalized for a primary reason of heart failure or have had a hospitalization or admission to an emergency room for heart failure within one year prior to screening. In order to be eligible to participate in GALACTIC-HF patients should have an LVEF \u00a3 35%, be NYHA class II to IV, and have an elevated BNP or NT-proBNP. Patients will be randomized to either placebo or omecamtiv mecarbil with dose titration up to a maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily based on the plasma concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil after initiation of drug therapy. The primary endpoint is a composite of time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure event, which is defined as either a hospitalization for heart failure or other urgent treatment for worsening heart failure. Secondary endpoints include time to cardiovascular death; patient reported outcomes as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score; time to first heart failure hospitalization; and all-cause death.\nCytokinetics and Amgen are also planning a potential exercise performance/cardiac function clinical trial to be conducted by Cytokinetics. Amgen will be responsible for reimbursing us for the out-of-pocket development costs associated with this clinical trial.\nFurther details regarding the clinical development of omecamtiv mecarbil can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Cardiac Muscle Contractility Program - Omecamtiv Mecarbil\u201d\nOngoing Research in Cardiac Muscle Contractility. We continued our joint research program with Amgen directed to next-generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program in 2016. We expect to continue our joint research program with Amgen into 2017. Under the Amgen Agreement, Amgen will reimburse us for certain research activities we perform.\nThe clinical trials program for omecamtiv mecarbil may proceed for several years, and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved, and the drug is commercialized. Omecamtiv mecarbil is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur. We funded all research and development costs associated with this program prior to Amgen's option exercise in May 2009. We anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program will increase if we participate in the future advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil through clinical development. Our expenditures will also increase if Amgen terminates development of omecamtiv mecarbil or related compounds and we elect to develop them independently, or if we elect to co-fund later-stage development of omecamtiv mecarbil or other compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration and option agreement with Amgen.\nResearch and Development Expenses. We recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our cardiac muscle contractility program of approximately $8.1 million, $5.8 million and $7.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recognized net research and development revenue from Amgen of $1.2 million, $2.5 million and $4.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, consisting of reimbursements of FTEs and other expenses offset by a payment related to Cytokinetics' option to co-fund the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil for an increased royalty percentage. We anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program will increase if we participate in the future advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil through clinical development. We also anticipate incurring future payments related to the co-investment option for which we provided notice of exercise in 2016 that will be offset against research and development revenues.\nBeyond Muscle Contractility\nWe have developed preclinical expertise in the mechanics of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle that extends from proteins to tissues to intact animal models. Our translational research in muscle contractility has enabled us to better understand the potential impact of small molecule compounds that increase skeletal or cardiac muscle contractility and to apply those findings to the further evaluation of our drug candidates in clinical populations. In addition to contractility, the other major functions of muscle play a role in certain diseases that could benefit from novel mechanism treatments. Accordingly, our knowledge of muscle contractility may serve as an entry point to the discovery of novel treatments for disorders involving muscle functions other than muscle contractility. We are leveraging our current understandings of muscle biology to investigate new ways of modulating these other aspects of muscle function for other potential therapeutic applications.\nDevelopment Risks\nThe successful development of any of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. We cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature, timing and costs of the activities necessary to complete the development of any of our drug candidates or the date of completion of these development activities due to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 the results of clinical trials of our drug candidates conducted by us or our partners may not support the further clinical development of those drug candidates; \n \u2022 further clinical development of tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS will require significant additional funding and we may be unable to obtain such additional funding on acceptable terms, if at all; \n \u2022 the FDA and/or other regulatory authorities may not accept effects on respiratory function, including SVC, as appropriate clinical trial endpoints to support the registration of tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS; \n \u2022 the FDA and/or other regulatory authorities may not accept the data from the clinical trials of tirasemtiv as sufficient to determine the safest and most effective dose of tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS; \n \u2022 decisions made by Amgen with respect to the development of omecamtiv mecarbil and by Astellas with respect to the development of CK-2127107; \n \u2022 the uncertainty of the timing of the initiation and completion of patient enrollment and treatment in our or our partners' clinical trials; \n \u2022 the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing of the analyses of our clinical trial data after these trials have been initiated and completed; \n \u2022 our potential inability to obtain additional funding and resources for our development activities on acceptable terms, if at all, including, but not limited to, our potential inability to obtain or retain partners to assist in the design, management, conduct and funding of clinical trials; \n \u2022 failure by our clinical trial sites, clinical research organizations, clinical manufacturing organizations and other third parties supporting our or our partners' clinical trials to fulfill their obligations or otherwise perform as expected; \n \u2022 delays or additional costs in manufacturing of our drug candidates for clinical trial use, including developing appropriate formulations of our drug candidates; \n \u2022 the uncertainty of clinical trial results, including variability in patient response; \n \u2022 the uncertainty of obtaining FDA or other foreign regulatory agency approval required for the clinical investigation of our drug candidates; \n \u2022 the uncertainty related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing processes and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing facility; \n \u2022 the possibility that results from non-clinical studies may adversely impact the timing or further development of our drug candidates; and \n \u2022 possible delays in the characterization, formulation and manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of drug candidates and other compounds.  If we fail to complete the development of any of our drug candidates in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and liquidity. In addition, any failure by us or our partners to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our programs as planned, or at all, and certain consequences of failing to do so are discussed further in the risk factors entitled \u201cWe will need substantial additional capital in the future to sufficiently fund our operations,\u201d \u201cWe have never generated, and may never generate, revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and we may not have drugs to market for at least several years, if ever,\u201d \u201cClinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay completion of clinical development and regulatory approval\u201d and \u201cClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and subject to delay,\u201d and other risk factors.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenues\nOur current revenue sources are limited, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for several years, if at all. We have recognized revenues from our strategic alliances with Amgen, Astellas, and MyoKardia, Inc. (\u201cMyoKardia\u201d) and grant revenues from The ALS Association (the \u201cALSA\u201d).\nThe following table summarizes the sources of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as follows (in thousands):\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Astellas\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,836 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenues from Astellas\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,227 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amgen\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development revenues, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenues from Amgen\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MyoKardia - Research and development revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ALSA - Grant Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,940 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Astellas\nIn June 2013, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Astellas (the \u201cOriginal Astellas Agreement\u201d), that was amended and restated in December 2014 (the \u201c2014 Astellas Agreement\u201d).\nRefer to Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Skeletal Muscle Contractility Program - CK-2127107 - Astellas Strategic Alliance\u201d for further details regarding the collaboration agreements.\nIn July 2013, we received an upfront payment of $16.0 million in connection with the execution of the Original Astellas Agreement. The Original Astellas Agreement provided for us to potentially receive over $24.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the initial two years of the collaboration and for research and early and late stage development milestone payments based on various research and clinical milestones. We determined the license and the research and development services relating to the Original Astellas Agreement are a single unit of accounting as the license was determined to not have stand-alone value. Accordingly, we are recognizing this revenue using the proportional performance model. During 2014, revenue from reimbursement of research and development activities also included $2.0 million in research and development milestone fees and $15.0 million in milestone fees in connection with the decision made by Astellas to advance CK-2127107 into Phase 2 clinical development.\nIn January 2015, we received an upfront license fee payment of $30.0 million in connection with the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement. Also, in conjunction with the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold 2,040,816 shares of our common stock to Astellas at a price per share of $4.90. The aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million was received in December 2014. We determined the fair value of the stock issued to Astellas to be $9.1 million. The $0.9 million excess of cash received over fair value of was deferred and will be recognized as revenue as services are performed over approximately 24 months. We determined that the license and the research and development services relating to the 2014 Astellas Agreement are a single unit of accounting as the license was determined to not have stand-alone value. Accordingly, we are recognizing this revenue using the proportional performance model over the initial research term of the 2014 Astellas Agreement.\nConcurrently with the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement and related common stock purchase agreement, we received $15.0 million as a milestone payment relating to Astellas' decision to advance CK-2127107 into Phase 2 clinical development. We were also eligible to potentially receive over $20.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the two years of the collaboration following the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement.\nIn 2016, Cytokinetics and Astellas further amended the collaboration agreement to expand the collaboration to include the development of CK-2127107 (\u201c2016 Astellas Amendment\u201d) for the potential treatment of ALS, as well as the possible development in ALS of other fast skeletal regulatory activators previously licensed by Cytokinetics to Astellas. The 2016 Astellas Amendment became effective in September 2016. In connection with the 2016 Astellas Amendment, we received a non-refundable upfront amendment fee of $35.0 million. In addition, we received the accelerated payment of a $15.0 million milestone for the initiation of the first Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 as the lead compound in ALS that was otherwise provided for in the 2014 Astellas Agreement, as if such milestone had been achieved upon the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment. We determined that the ALS license and the additional research and development services relating to the 2016 Astellas Amendment each have stand-alone value. We have recognized $50.0 million license revenue related to the ALS license on the effective date of the arrangement while the allocated consideration for the research and development services will be recognized over the development term on a proportional basis. During 2016, revenue from reimbursement of research and development activities also included $2.0 million in research and development milestone fees.\nRefer to Note 7, \u201cRelated Parties and Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the accounting treatment under this collaboration agreement.\nUnder the Current Astellas Agreement, additional research and early and late state development milestone payments which are based on various research and clinical milestones, including the initiation of certain clinical studies, the submission for approval of a drug candidate to certain regulatory authorities for marketing approval and the commercial launch of collaboration products could total over $600.0 million, including up to $95.0 million relating to CK-2127107 in non-neuromuscular indications, and over $100.0 million related to CK-2127107 in each of SMA and other neuromuscular indications. Additionally, $200.0 million in commercial milestones could be received under the Current Astellas Agreement provided certain sales targets are met. Due to the nature of drug development, including the inherent risk of development and approval of drug candidates by regulatory authorities, it is not possible to estimate if and when these milestone payments could become due.\nIn the event Astellas commercializes any collaboration products, the Company will receive royalties on sales of such collaboration products, including royalties ranging from the high single digits to the high teens on sales of products containing CK-2127107. We can co-fund certain development costs for CK-2127107 and other compounds in exchange for increased milestone payments and royalties; such royalties may increase under certain scenarios to exceed twenty percent. Under the Current Astellas Agreement, we retain an option to co-promote collaboration products containing fast skeletal troponin activators for neuromuscular indications in the U.S., Canada and Europe, in addition to its option to co-promote other collaboration products in the U.S. and Canada as provided for in the Original Astellas Agreement. Astellas will reimburse us for certain expenses associated with its co-promotion activities.\nIn connection with the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment, the Company received a $15.0 million non-refundable option fee for the grant of the Option on Tirasemtiv in October 2016. Prior to Astellas' exercise of the option, the Company will continue the development of tirasemtiv, including the VITALITY-ALS trial, at its own expense to support regulatory approval in the U.S., EU and certain other jurisdictions and will retain the final decision making authority on the development of tirasemtiv.\nAmgen\nIn June 2013, we and Amgen executed an amendment (the \u201cAmgen Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Amgen Agreement to include Japan, resulting in a worldwide collaboration.\nFurther details regarding our strategic alliance with Amgen can be found in Item 1 of this report under \u201cResearch and Development Programs - Cardiac Muscle Contractility Program - Amgen Strategic Alliance.\u201d\nWe have received reimbursements from Amgen for certain research and development activities during 2016, 2015 and 2014, which we recorded as revenue as the related expenses were incurred. We may be eligible to receive further reimbursements from Amgen for certain research and development activities, which we will record as revenue if and when the related expenses are incurred. We record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue. Revenues related to the reimbursement of FTEs were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our FTEs.\nRefer to Note 7, \u201cRelated Parties and Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the accounting treatment under this collaboration agreement.\nUnder the Amgen Agreement, as amended, the Company is eligible to receive over $300.0 million in additional development milestone payments which are based on various clinical milestones, including the initiation of certain clinical studies, the submission of a drug candidate to certain regulatory authorities for marketing approval and the receipt of such approvals. Additionally, the Company is eligible to receive up to $300.0 million in commercial milestone payments provided certain sales targets are met. Due to the nature of drug development, including the inherent risk of development and approval of drug candidates by regulatory authorities, it is not possible to estimate if and when these milestone payments would become due. The achievement of each of these milestones is dependent solely upon the results of Amgen's development and commercialization activities and therefore none of these milestones was deemed to be substantive.\nIn December 2016, we received a $26.7 million milestone payment from Amgen coincident with the start of GALACTIC-HF. The $26.7 million milestone payment from Amgen was recognized as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recognized no revenue for milestones achieved under the Amgen Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Also in December 2016, we provided notice of our exercise of our option to co-invest in the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil in exchange for increased royalties from Amgen on worldwide sales of omecamtiv mecarbil outside Japan.\nMyoKardia\nIn August 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with MyoKardia. Under an agreed research plan, scientists from MyoKardia and our FTEs conducted research focused on small molecule therapeutics that inhibit cardiac sarcomere proteins. We provided MyoKardia access to certain research facilities, and provided FTEs and other resources at agreed reimbursement rates that approximated our costs. We were the primary obligor in the collaboration arrangement, and accordingly, we recorded expense reimbursements from MyoKardia as research and development revenue. The research plan ended as planned in August 2013. In October 2016, we received a $0.2 million milestone payment from MyoKardia for the initiation of first Phase IIa clinical trial.\nALSA Grant\nIn July 2015, we were awarded a $1.5 million grant from The ALS Association (the \u201cALSA Grant\u201d) to support the conduct of VITALITY-ALS as well as the collection of clinical data and plasma samples from patients in VITALITY-ALS in order to help advance the discovery of potentially useful biomarkers in ALS. The grant provides funding for collaboration among Cytokinetics, The ALS Association and the Barrow Neurological Institute to enable plasma samples collected from patients enrolled in VITALITY-ALS to be added to The Northeastern ALS Consortium (NEALS) Repository, a resource for the academic research community to identify biomarkers that may help to assess disease progression and underlying disease mechanisms in ALS. In August 2015, we achieved the first milestone under the ALSA Grant which triggered a payment of $0.5 million in accordance with the ALSA Grant and in 2016, we achieved a second milestone which triggered a payment of $0.3 million in accordance with the ALSA Grant. We recorded grant revenue as qualified expenses were incurred and approved by management.\nBecause a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and other pre-commercialization milestones under our strategic alliances with Amgen and Astellas, our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year.\nIf one or more of our drug candidates is approved for sale as a drug, we expect that our future revenues will most likely be derived from royalties on sales from drugs licensed to Amgen and Astellas under our respective strategic alliances and from those licensed to future partners, and from direct sales of our drugs.\nResearch and Development\nWe incur research and development expenses associated with both partnered and our own research activities. We expect to incur research and development expenses for the clinical development of tirasemtiv. We expect to incur research and development expenses for CK-2127107 in accordance with agreed upon research and development plans with Astellas. We expect to incur research and development expenses for omecamtiv mecarbil and other next-generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program in accordance with agreed upon research and development plans with Amgen.\nResearch and development expenses related to any development and commercialization activities we elect to fund consist primarily of employee compensation, supplies and materials, costs for consultants and contract research and manufacturing, facilities costs and depreciation of equipment.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions, including, but not limited to, finance, human resources, legal, business and commercial development and strategic planning. Other significant costs include facilities costs, consulting costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and regulatory compliance.\nStock Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation related to stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchases for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Amgen. Revenues from Astellas, which became a related party in December 2014, were $15.1 million, $12.2 million, and $15.0 million for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and consisted of reimbursements of internal costs for certain full-time employee equivalents, and other research and development expenses. Revenues from Astellas in 2016 and 2014 included $2.0 million and $15.0 million in milestone revenues, respectively. All research and development revenues from Astellas, prior to it becoming a related party are classified in research and development, grant and other revenues. Revenues from Amgen were $27.9 million, $2.5 million and $4.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenue from Amgen in 2016 included $26.7 million in a milestone payment, and $0.6 million in reimbursement of internal costs for certain full-time employee equivalents, partially offset by a payment of $1.3 million related to the option to co-fund Phase 3 development of omecamtiv mecarbil for an increased royalty percentage. Revenue from Amgen in 2015 and 2014 consisted of reimbursement of internal costs for certain full-time employee equivalents, and recognition of allocated consideration relating to the Amgen Agreement Amendment.\nResearch and development, grant and other revenues in 2016 and 2015 consisted primarily of $1.1 million and $0.1 million of research and development revenues from our collaboration with ALSA, respectively. Research and development, grant and other revenues in 2014 consisted primarily of revenues from our strategic alliance with Astellas, prior to becoming a related party in December 2014, including $15.4 million of research and development reimbursement revenues and $2.0 million in milestone revenues from our collaboration with Astellas, as well as $0.1 million in revenue from our collaboration with MyoKardia.\nLicense revenues from related parties refers to license revenues from our strategic alliances with Astellas and Amgen. License revenues from Astellas, which became a related party in December 2014, were $62.2 million and $13.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. License revenue from Astellas in 2016 consisted of the recognition of the $50.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas under the 2016 Astellas Amendment, and the recognition of a portion of the $30.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas in January 2015. License revenue from Astellas in 2015 consisted of the recognition of a portion of the $30.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas in January 2015 and the recognition of a portion of the $16.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas in July 2013. The upfront license fees were recognized using the proportional performance model.\nLicense revenues refers to license revenues from our collaboration with Astellas, prior to it becoming a related party in December 2014. License revenues from Astellas included $9.8 million in 2014 of the $16.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas in July 2013 in connection with the execution of the Original Astellas Agreement. We recognized this revenue over the term of the research and development services using the proportional performance model.\nResearch and development expenses\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in research and development expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $12.1 million in outsourced clinical costs, $4.5 million in personnel related expenses and non-cash stock compensation expense, and $0.8 million in outsourced research costs, partially offset by a decrease of $4.2 million in outsourced preclinical costs mainly associated with clinical manufacturing activities. The increase in outsourced clinical costs was comprised of an increase of $16.6 million in outsourced clinical costs mainly associated with VITALITY-ALS, offset by a $4.5 million litigation settlement in June 2016 from a contract research organization for BENEFIT-ALS. The increase in research and development expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million in outsourced preclinical costs, an increase of $1.8 million in personnel related expenses due to increased headcount, and an increase of $0.4 million in lab expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in outsourced clinical costs associated with the completion of BENEFIT-ALS in the second quarter of 2014.\nThe following presents our research and development expenses by program:\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cardiac muscle contractility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Skeletal muscle contractility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Smooth muscle contractility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other research programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> From a program perspective, the $13.5 million increase in research and development spending in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increased spending of $12.9 million for our skeletal muscle contractility program, which included our skeletal muscle contractility program for tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS and the clinical program for CK-2127107 under our collaboration with Astellas, and a $2.3 million increase in our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration with Amgen, partially offset by decreased spending of $1.5 million in our other research and preclinical programs. The $2.0 million increase in research and development spending in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased spending of $3.4 million for our skeletal muscle contractility program, which included our skeletal muscle contractility program for tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS, and the clinical program for CK-2127107 under our collaboration with Astellas, and a $0.2 million increase in our other research and preclinical programs, partially offset by decreased spending of $1.6 million for our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration with Amgen.\nClinical development timelines, the likelihood of success and total completion costs vary significantly for each drug candidate and are difficult to estimate. We anticipate that we will determine on an ongoing basis which research and development programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program, taking into account the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate. The lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain and maintain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe expect our research and development expenditures to increase significantly in 2017 compared to 2016. We expect to continue the Phase 3 clinical development of our drug candidate tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS. Under our strategic alliance with Astellas, we expect to continue development of our drug candidate CK-2127107 for the potential treatment of SMA and potentially other diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness or wasting. Under our strategic alliance with Amgen, we expect to continue the Phase 3 development of our drug candidate omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> General and administrative expenses increased $8.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increased spending of $4.2 million in personnel-related expenses due to increased headcount and non-cash stock compensation expense, an increase of $1.7 million in corporate and patent legal fees, and an increase of $1.7 million in outsourced costs related to commercial development, grants and sponsorships, and accounting and finance and recruitment related costs. The increase of $2.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased spending of $1.4 million for personnel-related costs due to increased headcount and increased spending of $0.8 million for outside services mainly related to commercial development. We expect that general and administrative expenses in 2017 will increase significantly compared to 2016, mainly due to increased headcount.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily consisted of interest expense related to the loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank entered into in October 2015. Interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to interest expense related to the long-term debt obligations which commenced in fourth quarter 2015.\nInterest and Other Income, net\nInterest and other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, primarily consisted of interest income generated from the Company's cash, cash equivalents and investments. In 2016 and 2015, interest income also included net gains realized upon disposal of equipment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financial condition is summarized as follows:\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial assets:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current portions of long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total working capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> From August 5, 1997, our date of inception, through December 31, 2016, we funded our operations through the sale of equity securities, non-equity payments from collaborators, long term debt, capital equipment financings, grants and interest income. Due to our substantial research and development expenditures, we have generated significant operating losses since our inception. Our expenditures are primarily related to research and development activities. As of December 31, 2016, we had available cash, cash equivalents and investments of $163.9 million.\nEquity Securities\nWe have received net proceeds from the sale of equity securities of $500.0 million from August 5, 1997, the date of our inception, through December 31, 2016, excluding sales of equity to Amgen, Astellas, and GlaxoSmithKline (\u201cGSK\u201d). Included in these proceeds are $94.0 million received upon closing of the initial public offering of our common stock in May 2004. In connection with execution of our collaboration and license agreement with GSK in 2001, GSK made a $14.0 million equity investment in us. GSK made additional equity investments in us in 2003 and 2004 of $3.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. In January 2007, in connection with the execution of the Amgen Agreement, we received net proceeds of $32.9 million from a stock purchase agreement with Amgen. In June 2013, in conjunction with the Amgen Agreement Amendment, we sold 1,404,100 shares of common stock to Amgen for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million. In December 2014, in connection with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we sold 2,040,816 shares of common stock to Astellas for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million.\nCollaboration Partners\nOn a cumulative basis through December 31, 2016, we have received $160.7 million in non-equity payments from Amgen, $169.1 million in non-equity payments from Astellas, and $54.5 million in non-equity payments from GSK, in each case related to our strategic alliances.\nOriginal Astellas Agreement\nIn June 2013, we entered into the Original Astellas Agreement (see Note 7, \u201cRelated Party Research and Development Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In July 2013, we received an\nupfront non-refundable license payment of $16.0 million in connection with the execution of the Original Astellas Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement we were eligible to potentially receive over $24.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the initial two years of the collaboration. In addition, the agreement also provided for payments for the achievement of pre-specified milestones relating to the joint research and development program.\n2014 Astellas Agreement\nIn December 2014, we entered into the 2014 Astellas Agreement, which superseded the Original Astellas Agreement (see Note 7, \u201cRelated Party Research and Development Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Under the terms of the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront license fee of $30.0 million in January 2015. In conjunction with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold 2,040,816 shares common stock to Astellas at a price per share of $4.90. The aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million was received in December 2014. We determined the fair value of the stock issued to Astellas to be $9.1 million. The excess of cash received over fair value of $0.9 million was deferred and will be recognized as revenue as services are performed over approximately 24 months.\nWe were eligible to potentially receive over $20.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the two years of the collaboration following execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement.\n2016 Astellas Amendment (Inclusion of ALS as an Added Indication and Option on Tirasemtiv)\nThe 2016 Amendment to the 2014 Astellas Agreement (\u201c2016 Astellas Amendment\u201d) became effective in September 2016 (collectively with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, the \u201cCurrent Astellas Agreement\u201d). Under the 2016 Astellas Amendment, we granted Astellas an option to enter into a pre-negotiated agreement for a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of tirasemtiv. If Astellas exercises the option, Astellas will receive exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for Astellas outside Cytokinetics' commercialization territory in North America, Europe and other select countries. In addition, the 2016 Astellas Amendment expands our collaboration with Astellas to include the development of CK-2127107 for the potential treatment of ALS, as well as other fast skeletal regulatory activators licensed to Astellas under the 2014 Astellas Agreement. Finally, the 2016 Astellas Amendment extends the existing joint research program focused on the discovery of additional next-generation skeletal muscle activators through 2017, including sponsored research at Cytokinetics.\nIn connection with the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment, we received a $15.0 million non-refundable option fee for the grant of the Option on Tirasemtiv. Prior to Astellas' exercise of the option, we will continue the development of tirasemtiv, including VITALITY-ALS, at our own expense to support regulatory approval in the U.S., EU and certain other jurisdictions and will retain the final decision making authority on the development of tirasemtiv. If Astellas exercises the option, we will grant Astellas an exclusive license to develop and commercialize tirasemtiv outside Cytokinetics' own commercialization territory of North America, Europe and other select countries. Each party would be primarily responsible for the further development of tirasemtiv in its territory and have the exclusive right to commercialize tirasemtiv in its territory.\nAlso in connection with the execution of the 2016 Astellas Amendment, we received a non-refundable upfront amendment fee of $35.0 million. We also received the accelerated payment of a $15.0 million milestone payment for the initiation of the first Phase 2 clinical"}
