Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a gene therapy company committed to discovering and developing novel medicines that can offer potentially life-changing therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from chronic or debilitating disease. We have leveraged our next-generation gene therapy platform to create a pipeline of product candidates. Our product candidates are designed to provide durable efficacy by inducing sustained expression of a therapeutic protein.\nWe are targeting diseases with unmet medical need, including ophthalmic diseases such as wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), as well as rare genetic diseases. We believe that there are several important benefits to focusing on the development of rare genetic diseases including the following:\nTable 286: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> well-known disease pathways which we believe are particularly amenable to gene therapy, especially in conditions that are caused by a defect in expression of a single gene;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> gene therapy is believed to offer a versatile protein delivery system with persistent expression;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> local delivery of the therapeutic protein; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> significant market demand for therapies that can offer long-term clinical benefit with potentially a one-time administration.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor ophthalmic diseases, such as wet AMD, there are further benefits including the following:\nTable 290: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> reduced risk of harmful immune responses and systemic side effects due to localized delivery in a self-contained organ; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> well-defined and objective clinical endpoints such as the ability to read an eye chart.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo date, our primary focus has been the development of AVA-101 for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). We generated human proof-of-concept data for AVA-101 in a Phase 1 trial with eight wet AMD subjects conducted at Lions Eye Institute (LEI) in Australia, of whom six were randomized to treatment with AVA-101 and two to standard-of-care therapy in the form of ranibizumab injections on an as-needed basis per protocol. Six of these subjects were available for evaluation at 36 months, and of these six subjects, four were treated with AVA-101. In June 2015, we announced the 36-month follow-up data on the six subjects, which confirmed the safety profile of the drug previously reported at 12 months.\nAdditionally, we conducted a Phase 2a trial for AVA-101 at LEI with 32 additional wet AMD subjects, for which we announced top-line results in June 2015. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2a study was based on ophthalmic and systemic safety, and secondary endpoints included retinal thickness (which can be a sign of reoccurrence of fluid in the retina), visual acuity and the need for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in the form of rescue injections with ranibizumab. The Phase 2a clinical study met its 12-month primary endpoint, demonstrating that AVA-101 was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile in subjects with wet AMD. No serious adverse events related to AVA-101 were observed. Overall, we did not observe evidence of a complete and/or durable anti-VEGF response in the majority of subjects treated with AVA-101 as administered in the Phase 2a study. We decided not to move forward with the Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 with the dose and administration procedure that we had planned to initiate in the second half of 2015. Instead, we are conducting additional preclinical studies to inform further development of our wet AMD program.\nRegeneron had a time-limited right of first negotiation for certain rights to AVA-101 as part of our collaboration. In September 2015, we initiated, by notice and delivery of AVA-101 clinical data to Regeneron, the time period for Regeneron to elect whether to exercise its right of first negotiation. On November 2, 2015, Regeneron notified the Company that it was not exercising this right of first negotiation.\nIn addition to AVA-101, we are working on other product candidates for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases, including:\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> AVA-201. We are developing AVA-201 as a next-generation product candidate for the prevention of wet AMD. AVA-201 produces the same anti-VEGF protein as AVA-101 using a proprietary, customized delivery mechanism, or vector.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> AVA-311. As part of our research collaboration with Regeneron, AVA-311 is being evaluated in preclinical studies for the treatment of juvenile X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), a rare genetic disease of the retina with no approved therapy. There are approximately 10,000 boys and young men in the United States suffering from the disease. XLRS is caused by mutation of the RS1 gene and results in splitting of retinal layers and corresponding loss of vision. In preclinical studies in animals to date, AVA-311 has delayed the progression of XLRS and improved vision by delivering functional copies of the RS1 gene in retinal cells of mice.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> AVA-322 and AVA-323. We are developing AVA-322 and AVA-323 for the treatment of color vision deficiency (CVD), commonly known as red-green color blindness. CVD is a highly prevalent genetic disorder that affects approximately 8 percent of males and 0.5 percent of females, with some variation by race, and is most commonly caused by genetic mutations in the opsin genes that impact the ability of the cone cells to respond to various wavelengths of light in the retina.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn January 13, 2015, we completed a public offering of 2,369,375 shares of our common stock (Follow-on Offering), which included 359,918 shares we issued pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, and we received net proceeds of approximately $130.6 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\nIn March 2015, (i) the Company received net proceeds of approximately $8.3 million, after discounts and other issuance costs, which resulted from the sale of 230,000 common shares, and (ii) the Company issued 230,000 common shares to a stockholder that exercised warrants prior to the initial public offering.\nIn July 2015, the Company's then Chief Executive officer resigned and some of his stock-based awards were forfeited and cancelled, which resulted in $2.4 million of additional stock-based compensation expense recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated financial statements. He will continue providing services to the Company until July 2016 as a consultant.\nOn December 22, 2015, the Company implemented a restructuring plan to reduce operating costs and better align its workforce with the needs of its business following its decision to not initiate the Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 in the second half of 2015. The plan resulted in a reduction of approximately 20% of the Company's workforce. In connection with the restructuring, the Company recorded estimated restructuring charges of approximately $2.6 million related to one-time termination severance payments and other employee-related benefits, including approximately $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the acceleration of restricted stock unit awards in December 2015.\nOn January 29, 2016, the Company entered into an acquisition agreement (the Agreement) with Annapurna Therapeutics SAS (Annapurna), a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing gene therapy for unmet medical needs, certain shareholders of Annapurna (the Contributors), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, acting as the representative of the Contributors. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Agreement, the Company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Annapurna in exchange for approximately 13.1 million newly issued shares of the Company's common stock (the Company Common Stock), and the outstanding options or other rights to purchase capital stock of Annapurna (the Annapurna Options) will be converted into options relating to approximately 4.7 million shares of the Company Common Stock (the Company Options) (together with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Transaction). Each Company Option will relate to the whole number of shares of Company Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of the shares of the common stock of Annapurna subject to such Annapurna Option multiplied by 9.5615 (as may be adjusted pursuant to the Agreement, the Exchange Ratio). The exercise price per share for the Company Option will be equal to the exercise price per share of such Annapurna Option divided by the Exchange Ratio. Holders of Annapurna Options may exercise their Annapurna Options prior to the closing of the transaction, in which case each such exercising holder will become party to the Agreement as a Contributor and receive newly issued shares of the Company's common stock upon closing instead of Company Options. The transaction requires the Company's stockholders' vote and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.\nThe Agreement may be terminated by either party under certain circumstances as defined in the Agreement, including, among others, if the closing of the acquisition has not occurred by the six-month anniversary of the execution of the Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, or if the Company's stockholders fail to approve the issuance of the Company's stock (Company Stock Issuance).\nThe Agreement provides for the Company to pay to Annapurna a reverse termination fee of $4,000,000 if the Agreement is terminated by either party for the Company's failure to obtain the required vote of the Company's stockholders for the Company Stock Issuance or if the Agreement is terminated by Annapurna upon a certain defined triggering event. The Agreement also provides for the Company to pay to Annapurna termination fee of $6,000,000 (less the $4,000,000 termination fee described above, if paid) if the Agreement is terminated by either party for the failure to obtain the required vote of the Company's stockholders or by Annapurna upon certain other triggering events, and either (x) the Company consummates within twelve months of such termination an alternative transaction that was publicly announced or communicated in writing to the Company's board of directors prior to such termination or (y) the Company consummates within six months of such termination an alternative transaction that is first publicly announced or otherwise communicated in writing to the Company's board of directors following the termination of the Agreement while an alternative transaction described in the foregoing clause (x) remains outstanding and not withdrawn.\nFinancial Overview\nSummary\nWe have not generated positive cash flow or net income from operations since our inception and, at December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $84.2 million, primarily as a result of research and development, general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges. We expect to incur substantial losses from operations in the foreseeable future as we continue our research and development efforts, advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, manufacture clinical study materials, seek regulatory approval and prepare for, and if approved, proceed to commercialization. We are at an early stage of development and may never be successful in developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nSee Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital-We have incurred significant operating losses since inception, and we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may never become profitable or, if achieved, be able to sustain profitability.\u201d\nWhile we may in the future generate revenue from a variety of sources, including license fees, milestone and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and potentially revenue from approved product sales, we have not yet generated any revenue from approved therapeutic product candidates.\nPrior to the IPO, we financed our operations through private placements of convertible notes and preferred stock with our investors, funding under our government grants and revenue from research collaboration and license agreements. We entered into our first license revenue generating agreement during the first quarter of 2014. We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since commencement of our operations.\nWe have no manufacturing facilities, and all of our manufacturing activities are contracted out to a third party. Additionally, we currently utilize third-party clinical research organizations (CROs) to carry out our clinical development and we do not yet have a sales organization.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates, including conducting additional preclinical studies to inform further development of our wet AMD program. We will need substantial additional funding in the future to support our operating activities as we advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval and prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital, or to do so on acceptable terms, when needed, or to form additional collaboration partnerships to support our efforts, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or potential commercialization efforts.\nOn January 13, 2015, we completed a Follow-on Offering and we received net proceeds of approximately $130.6 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2015, we had $221.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $37.7 million of marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient funds to continue operations for the foreseeable future.\nRevenue\nTo date we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our products. In May 2014, we entered into a multi-year license and development agreement with Regeneron. Under the terms of the agreement, we received initial payments of $8.0 million that included payment for research license fees, prepaid collaboration research costs and the right of first negotiation for a potential license to develop and commercialize AVA-101. As the agreement provides for multiple deliverables, we account for this agreement as a multiple elements revenue arrangement. If deliverables do not appear to have a standalone fair value, they were combined with other deliverables into a unit of accounting with standalone fair value. We allocated the $8.0 million received to the fair values of the two units of accounting identified in the arrangement. We expect to recognize $6.5 million for research licenses and related research and development services ratably over the associated period of performance, which is the maximum research period of eight years. As there is no discernible pattern of performance and/or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, we will recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the eight-year performance period. The remaining $1.5 million allocated to the second unit of accounting for the time-limited right of first negotiation for AVA-101 was deferred. On November 2, 2015, Regeneron notified the management that it was not exercising this right of first negotiation and we recognized the entire $1.5 million as revenue in 2015.\nThe portion of the upfront payment that was applied to the original research budget was fully used in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the Company and Regeneron, through a joint review committee, will agree annually on an updated research and development services budget through the research period. The Company will invoice Regeneron quarterly for services performed in each prior quarter in accordance with the agreement with Regeneron. These additional research fees will be added to the research licenses and related research and development services unit of accounting, recorded as deferred revenue and recognized to revenue over the remaining maximum research term. The Company recognized $0.8 million as revenue related to this unit of accounting during the year ended December 31, 2015, and recorded $5.6 million of deferred revenue, including $0.9 million as current portion, and $0.4 million as receivable from collaboration partner as of December 31, 2015.\nOur ability to generate product revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the amount or timing of product revenue. Even if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of our products, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nConducting a significant amount of research and development is central to our business model. Research and development expenses include certain payroll and personnel expenses, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, external contract research and development expenses, including expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical study materials and overhead expenses, including rent, equipment depreciation, insurance and utilities.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods or services for future research and development activities are deferred and expensed as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\nWe estimate preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. We estimate the amounts incurred through communications with third party service providers and our estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date are based on information available at the time. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or aggregate costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of a product candidate is highly uncertain, and clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development and commercialization costs can differ materially from expectations.\nWe received refundable tax credits from the Australian tax authorities in connection with certain research costs incurred by our subsidiary conducting research in Australia. These refunds do not depend on our taxable income or tax position and therefore we do not account for them under an income tax accounting model. We recognize such refunds as government grants in the period when qualified expenses are incurred as a reduction of research expenses. We have recorded the reimbursement from the Australian tax authorities as a reduction of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the applicable period.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs, stock-based compensation, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development expenses. Our general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if and to the extent we elect to increase our investment in infrastructure to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We will continue to evaluate the need for such investment in conjunction with ongoing consideration of our pipeline of product candidates. We anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal and regulatory functions, as well as director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with being a public reporting company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net is comprised mainly of changes in the fair value of common stock warrant liabilities and preferred stock warrant liabilities in 2014 and interest income on our cash and investment in marketable securities in 2015. At the time of the IPO, all then outstanding warrants were exercised, and as a consequence, we do not expect to have any other income (expense), net related to changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities in future periods.\nIn April 2014, we recorded a $0.2 million loss related to the conversion of all outstanding convertible notes into Series B convertible preferred stock. In November 2013, we amended the terms of the convertible notes agreement to accelerate their conversion into shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, which we determined represented an extinguishment. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $1.7 million in 2013. We do not expect such charges in future periods as we have no outstanding convertible notes as of December 31, 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe have primarily generated revenue through a research and collaboration arrangement with a strategic partner for the development and commercialization of product candidates, and a license agreement related to the licensing of certain of our intellectual property. Additionally, we have historically generated grant revenue from research and development programs.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605). Accordingly, revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met:\nTable 295: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 296: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 298: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Collectability is reasonably assured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, current portion. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.\nIn May, 2014, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Regeneron. As a result, we are recognizing revenue under the agreement as discussed in Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nGovernment grants provide funds for certain types of expenditures in connection with research and development activities over a contractually defined period. Revenue related to government grants is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred and the related services are rendered, provided that the applicable performance obligations under the government grants have been met. We intend to continue to evaluate pursuing additional government grant opportunities on a case-by-case basis.\nAccrued Research and Development Expense\nWe estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, reviewing the terms of our license agreements, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. Expenses that are paid in advance of performance are deferred as a prepaid expense and expensed as the services are provided.\nExamples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees to:\nTable 299: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 300: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> CROs and other service providers in connection with clinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 301: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> investigative sites in connection with clinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 303: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> services providers for professional service fees such as consulting and related services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing may vary and may result in our reporting changes in estimates in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred. However, due to the nature of these estimates, we cannot assure you that we will not adjust our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical studies or other research activities.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock-based awards granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards to non-employees is recognized based on the then-current fair value at each measurement date over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term, using the accelerated attribution method. We have used the Black-Scholes valuation model to assist us in determining the fair value of stock-based awards. The Black-Scholes valuation model requires the use of subjective and highly complex assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units, or RSUs, are share awards that entitle the holder to receive freely tradable shares of our common stock upon vesting. The fair value of RSUs is based upon the closing sales price of our common stock on the grant date. RSUs granted to employees generally vest over a two-to-four year period.\nThere were no RSUs granted prior to April 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there was $6.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.\nStock Options Granted to Employees\nThe fair value of each option issued to employees was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nTable 304: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Options\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, there was $14.2 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to employees' awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.\nStock Options Granted to Non-Employees\nWe used the following weighted-average assumptions in estimating non-employees stock-based compensation expense:\nTable 305: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Option grants:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, there was $1.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-employees' awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.\nExpected volatility. We estimate expected volatility based on the average historical volatility of a peer group of comparable publicly traded life sciences and biotechnology companies with product candidates in similar stages of clinical development, as we do not have sufficient trading history for our common stock. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.\nExpected term. We derived the expected term using the simplified\u201d method (the expected term is determined as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options), as we have limited historical information to develop expectations about future exercise patterns and post vesting employment termination behavior. Expected term for non-employee awards is based on the remaining contractual term of an option on each measurement date. The expected term of the ESPP rights equals to the six-month look-back period.\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.\nExpected dividend yield. We have never paid any dividends and do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, used an expected dividend yield of zero in the valuation model.\nForfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent actual forfeitures differ from the estimates, the difference will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period that the estimates are revised.\nThe following table sets forth our total stock-based compensation expense for awards granted in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 306: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value of common stock. The fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our stock options has historically been determined by our board of directors. Because there has been no public market for our common stock and in the absence of recent arm's-length cash sales transactions of our common stock with independent third parties, our board of directors has determined the fair value of our common stock by considering at the time of grant a number of objective and subjective factors, including the following: independent third-party valuations as of December 31, 2012, March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, September 30, 2013, December 31, 2013, March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014; progress of research and development activities; our operating and financial performance, including our levels of available capital resources; rights and preferences of our common stock compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity securities; equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies, as reflected in comparable companies' market multiples, initial public offering (IPO) valuations and other metrics; the achievement of enterprise milestones, including our progress in clinical trials and potential collaborations with partners; the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock, such as an IPO given prevailing market and biotechnology sector conditions; sales of our convertible preferred stock in arms-length transactions; the illiquidity of our securities by virtue of being a private company; business risks; and management and board experience.\nThe independent third-party valuations used the income, guideline and transaction approaches based on our expected future cash flows and applied a discount for lack of marketability. The guideline approach measures value on a minority-interest basis; the transaction and income approaches measure value on a controlling basis. This approach is outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation\u201d as the probability-weighted expected return method (PWERM). Enterprise values were calculated based on three exit scenarios, including an IPO, a partnership for the development of our product candidate either in an earlier stage or a late stage of clinical development and a corporate failure. Each value was weighted based on the probability of each event's occurrence to arrive at an indicated enterprise value. In estimating the value of equities, management estimated a term for each of the IPO, partnership or corporate failure scenarios.\nFollowing the completion of our IPO in August 2014, the fair value of our common stock generally is determined by reference to the closing sales price of a share of our common stock on the grant date.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nIn October 2015, in connection with an amendment to our research agreement with LEI, we issued a warrant to LEI to purchase 40,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $10.51 per share. This common stock warrant is exercisable immediately, and expires on October 15, 2020. The Company estimated the fair value of this warrant to be approximately $0.2 million which was recorded as a debit to research and development expenses and a credit to additional paid-in capital upon issuance. The fair value of the warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and was based on the closing price of our common stock on the issuance date of $8.35 per share, the exercise price of $10.51, the contractual term of the warrant of 5 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.34%, an expected volatility of 75% and a 0% expected dividend yield.\nThe amendment also provides for the issuance of an additional warrant to LEI to purchase up to 40,000 shares of the Company's common stock upon completion of the 36 month follow-up on the Phase 2a AVA-101 clinical study (Contingent Warrant). As of December 31, 2015, none of the shares subject to the Contingent Warrant were vested and exercisable. The Company is accounting for this warrant as a stock-based award issued for service and estimated the fair value of the costs associated with the service performed to be approximately $30,000 which was recorded as a debit to research and development expenses and a credit to additional paid-in capital in 2015. The fair value of the Contingent Warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and was based on the closing price of common stock on December 31, 2015 of $9.52 per share, the expected term of the warrants of 6.6 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.1%, an expected volatility of 79% and a 0% expected dividend yield.\nIncome Tax\nWe recognize deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. We periodically evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon realizability of our deferred tax assets. Based upon the weight of available evidence, which includes our historical operating performance, reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results, we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 of approximately $28.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $79.4 million to offset future federal income. NOLs expire at various years beginning with 2026. As of December 31, 2015, the Company also had U.S. state NOL carryforwards of approximately $56.5 million to offset future state income. U.S. State NOLs expire at various years beginning with 2016. At December 31, 2015, the Company also had approximately $0.2 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards which may be available to offset future foreign income; these carryforwards do not expire.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we have experienced an ownership change.\u201d Generally, a Section 382 ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative increase of more than 50 percentage points in the stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of a corporation's stock within a specified testing period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We believe that we have experienced at least two ownership changes under Section 382 which will result in limitations in our ability to utilized net operating losses and credits. In addition, we may experience ownership changes as a result of our previous or future offerings or other changes in the ownership of our stock. As a result, the amount of the NOL carryforwards and research and credit carryforwards presented in our financial statements could be limited and may expire unutilized.\nWe record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. No interest and penalties related to income taxes have been recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss in 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, requiring management to evaluate whether events or conditions could impact an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures if necessary. Management will be required to perform the evaluation within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure will be determined based on whether management's plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt. The accounting standards update will be effective for the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early application permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to impact the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the FASB approved deferral of the effective date of this ASU by one year to December 15, 2017. The ASU's effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2018. The Company is evaluating the application of this ASU, but has not yet determined the potential effects it may have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Customer's Accounting of Fees Paid in Cloud Computing Arrangement, guidance on accounting for fees paid in cloud computing arrangements. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a services contract. All software licenses recognized under this guidance will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. The guidance becomes effective for the Company for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as non-current simplifies entities' processes as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non-current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowances. The Company elected to retrospectively adopt this accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements due to full valuation allowance recorded on our deferred taxes.\nOn January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for certain changes. The Company has not yet determined the potential effects the new standard will have of the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 307: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED\nDECEMBER 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> INCREASE/\n(DECREASE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,823\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,402\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,421\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of warrant liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of related-party\nconvertible notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,453\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25,404\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,049\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deemed dividend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,230\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (47,453\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,634\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (18,819\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nCollaboration revenue increased by $1.7 million to $2.3 million in 2015 from $0.6 million in 2014. In September 2015, we initiated, by notice and delivery of AVA-101 clinical data package to Regeneron, the time period for Regeneron to elect whether to exercise its right of first negotiation. In November 2015, Regeneron notified the Company that it was not exercising the right of first negotiation and the Company recognized $1.5 million related to the right of first negotiation as collaboration revenue in 2015. Collaboration revenue related to research licenses and related research and development services that we recognize ratably over the maximum research period of 8 years, was $0.8 million and $0.6 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014 years respectively.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increases of $5.7 million in salaries and related expenses due to increased employee headcount, $3.3 million in drug product process development expenses, clinical expenses, laboratory expenses and overhead and $2.4 million in external consulting expenses and research studies. The increase in research and development expenses was also due to a $0.2 million non-cash stock compensation charge related to the issuance of a common stock warrant. The increase was offset by $3.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses, as most of the expense related to non-employee stock option awards that are remeasured based on the price of our common stock at December 31, 2015.\nFor the periods presented, substantially all of our research and development expense related to development activities for AVA-101, for the treatment of wet AMD, and our other potential product candidates in our development program. We expect research and development expenses may increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our pipeline products and preclinical studies relating to our wet AMD program.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to expense increases of $3.6 million in salaries and expenses related to increased employee headcount, $5.2 million in stock-based compensation expenses, $1.9 million in public company-related expenses and overhead and $3.3 million in consulting and professional service expenses, as we expanded our operations and operated as a public company.\nWe expect general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if and to the extent we elect to increase our investment in infrastructure to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We will continue to assess such expenses in conjunction with ongoing consideration of our pipeline of product candidates. We anticipate increased costs in connection with increased professional fees associated with being a public company.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn connection with the restructuring, the Company estimates that it will incur aggregate restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2015 of approximately $2.6 million related to one-time termination severance payments and other employee-related benefits, including approximately $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the acceleration of restricted stock units.\nOther income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net is comprised mainly of changes in the fair value of common stock warrant liabilities and preferred stock warrant liabilities in 2014 and interest income on our cash and investment in marketable securities in 2015. At the time of the IPO, all then outstanding warrants classified as liabilities were exercised, and as a consequence, the Company does not expect to have any other income (expense), net related to changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities in future periods.\nChanges in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities\nWe recorded changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In connection with the completion of the IPO in August 2014, all of the then outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock were exercised. As a result of the exercises, we recorded a $0.8 million loss related to the change in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Related Party Convertible Notes\nIn April 2014, we converted the outstanding balance under our related-party convertible notes of $2.0 million into 295,115 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock at 90% of the purchase price paid by other investors, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $0.2 million in 2014.\nDeemed Dividend\nIn April 2014, we repurchased 531,208 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock for $4.0 million. The difference between the repurchase price of $7.53 per share and original issuance price of $1.45 per share was recorded as a deemed dividend of $3.2 million to a preferred stockholder and effected the calculation of net loss attributable to common stockholders and net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 308: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED\nDECEMBER 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> INCREASE/\n(DECREASE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government grant revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (480\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,402\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,454\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,948\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of embedded derivative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of warrant liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (92\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (667\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of related-party\nconvertible notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,671\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25,404\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,276\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,128\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deemed dividend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,230\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,230\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,634\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,276\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,358\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nCollaboration and license revenue increased by $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as we recognized revenue from the Regeneron agreement and from a license agreement entered into during the first quarter of 2014. Government grant revenue decreased to zero for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as we completed the work performed under the government grants during the 2013 fiscal year.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increases of $7.0 million in stock-based compensation expenses, $3.0 million in expenses related to an increase in our employee headcount, $2.5 million in drug product process development expenses and laboratory supplies and $1.6 million in external consulting expenses and research studies. Expenses during the year ended December 31, 2013 benefited from reimbursement of $0.8 million from the Australian tax authorities recorded as a reduction in research and development expense as compared to $0.1 million during 2014. For the periods presented, substantially all of our research and development expense related to our development activity for AVA-101 for the treatment of wet AMD, and the other potential product candidates in our development program. We expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our pipeline products and AVA-101 in late-stage clinical trials.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases of $1.8 million related in an increase in our employee headcount, $1.1 million in stock-based compensation expenses, $1.6 million in public company-related expenses and overhead and $2.5 million in consulting and professional service expenses, as we expanded our operations. We also recorded a $0.8 million non-cash one-time charge of collaboration acquisition costs in 2013 related to the issuance of 689,655 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to a potential collaborator for cash at a price per share below the fair value of such shares. We expect general and administrative costs to increase in future periods, reflecting both the increased costs in connection with the future commercialization of AVA-101 and our pipeline products, as well as an expanded infrastructure and increased professional fees associated with being a public company.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased to $18,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $73,000 for the comparable period in 2013 as outstanding convertible notes were converted into Series B convertible preferred stock in April 2014.\nChanges in Fair Value of Embedded Derivative\nWe recorded an embedded derivative liability in connection with our 2012 Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded income of $18,000 for the change in fair value of the embedded derivative liability. In November 2013, upon conversion of the 2012 Notes into Series A convertible preferred stock, the embedded derivative was reversed.\nChanges in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities\nWe recorded changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to ($92,000) for the year ended December 31, 2013. In connection with the completion of the IPO in August 2014, all of the then outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock were exercised. As a result of the exercises, we recorded a $0.8 million loss related to the change in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Related Party Convertible Notes\nIn April 2014, we converted the outstanding balance under our related-party convertible notes of $2.0 million into 295,115 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock at 90% of the purchase price paid by other investors, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $0.2 million in 2014.\nIn November 2013, we amended the terms of the convertible notes agreement to accelerate their conversion into shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, which we determined represented an extinguishment. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $1.7 million in 2013.\nDeemed Dividend\nIn April 2014, we repurchased 531,208 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock for $4.0 million. The difference between the repurchase price of $7.53 per share and original issuance price of $1.45 per share was recorded as a deemed dividend of $3.2 million to a preferred stockholder and effected the calculation of net loss attributable to common stockholders and net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Plan of Operations\nWe have not generated positive cash flow or net income from operations since our inception and at December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $84.2 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administration expenses. On January 13, 2015, we completed a Follow-on Offering and we received net proceeds of approximately $130.6 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2015, we had $221.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $37.7 million of marketable securities invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agencies securities with maturities of 12 months or less. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2015 will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future and, if the acquisition of Annapurna is consummated, sufficient to fund the combined company's operations for at least the next 36 months.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and ongoing internal research and development programs. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or aggregate amount of such costs. However, in order to complete our planned preclinical trials and any future clinical trials, and to complete the process of obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, as well as to build the sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure that we believe will be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, we will require substantial additional funding in the future.\nIf and when we seek additional funding, we will do so through equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital in the future could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. In order to complete development and commercialization of any of our product candidates, we anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional capital, the requirements of which will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 309: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and any clinical trials for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the outcome, timing of and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA and other regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the ability of our product candidates to progress through clinical development activities successfully;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our need to expand our research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the rate of progress and cost of our commercialization of our products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the cost of preparing to manufacture our products on a larger scale;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the costs of commercialization activities including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the degree and rate of market acceptance of any products launched by us or future partners;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 317: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 318: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our need to implement additional infrastructure and internal systems;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 319: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our ability to hire additional personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 320: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing, commercialization or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 321: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials.

Purchases of property and equipment were $3.0 million, $0.9 million and $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The purchases of property and equipment consisted primarily of acquisition of laboratory equipment to support our research and development activities.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $138.9 million consisted primarily of $130.6 million net proceeds from our Follow-on Offering and $8.3 million from sale of common shares.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $165.4 million consisted primarily of $116.5 million of net proceeds from our IPO and the concurrent private placement in July and August 2014, $0.6 million of proceeds from exercises of warrants, $50.4 million of proceeds from the sale of Series B convertible preferred stock, net of expenses, in April 2014, and $2.0 million of related-party convertible notes received in January and April 2014, offset by $4.0 million used to repurchase Series A convertible preferred stock in April 2014.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $2.5 million consisted primarily of $1.5 million from the borrowing under related-party convertible notes as well as $1.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Series A convertible preferred stock in November 2013 to a potential collaborator.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have lease obligations consisting of an operating lease for our operating facility that expires in 2020.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 323: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> LESS THAN\n1 YEAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 TO\n3 YEARS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 TO\n5 YEARS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> MORE THAN\n5 YEARS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> TOTAL\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe lease agreement provides for an escalation of rent payments each year and will expire on May 8, 2020.

As the amount and timing of sublicense fees and the achievement and timing of these milestones are not probable and estimable, such commitments have not been included on our balance sheet or in the

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a gene therapy company committed to discovering and developing novel medicines that can offer potentially life-changing therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from chronic or debilitating disease. We have leveraged our next-generation gene therapy platform to create a pipeline of product candidates. Our product candidates are designed to provide durable efficacy by inducing sustained expression of a therapeutic protein.\nWe are targeting diseases with unmet medical need, including ophthalmic diseases such as wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), as well as rare genetic diseases. We believe that there are several important benefits to focusing on the development of rare genetic diseases including the following:\n \u00b7 well-known disease pathways which we believe are particularly amenable to gene therapy, especially in conditions that are caused by a defect in expression of a single gene; \n \u00b7 gene therapy is believed to offer a versatile protein delivery system with persistent expression; \n \u00b7 local delivery of the therapeutic protein; and \n \u00b7 significant market demand for therapies that can offer long-term clinical benefit with potentially a one-time administration. \nFor ophthalmic diseases, such as wet AMD, there are further benefits including the following:\n \u00b7 reduced risk of harmful immune responses and systemic side effects due to localized delivery in a self-contained organ; and \n \u00b7 well-defined and objective clinical endpoints such as the ability to read an eye chart. \nTo date, our primary focus has been the development of AVA-101 for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). We generated human proof-of-concept data for AVA-101 in a Phase 1 trial with eight wet AMD subjects conducted at Lions Eye Institute (LEI) in Australia, of whom six were randomized to treatment with AVA-101 and two to standard-of-care therapy in the form of ranibizumab injections on an as-needed basis per protocol. Six of these subjects were available for evaluation at 36 months, and of these six subjects, four were treated with AVA-101. In June 2015, we announced the 36-month follow-up data on the six subjects, which confirmed the safety profile of the drug previously reported at 12 months.\nAdditionally, we conducted a Phase 2a trial for AVA-101 at LEI with 32 additional wet AMD subjects, for which we announced top-line results in June 2015. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2a study was based on ophthalmic and systemic safety, and secondary endpoints included retinal thickness (which can be a sign of reoccurrence of fluid in the retina), visual acuity and the need for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in the form of rescue injections with ranibizumab. The Phase 2a clinical study met its 12-month primary endpoint, demonstrating that AVA-101 was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile in subjects with wet AMD. No serious adverse events related to AVA-101 were observed. Overall, we did not observe evidence of a complete and/or durable anti-VEGF response in the majority of subjects treated with AVA-101 as administered in the Phase 2a study. We decided not to move forward with the Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 with the dose and administration procedure that we had planned to initiate in the second half of 2015. Instead, we are conducting additional preclinical studies to inform further development of our wet AMD program.\nRegeneron had a time-limited right of first negotiation for certain rights to AVA-101 as part of our collaboration. In September 2015, we initiated, by notice and delivery of AVA-101 clinical data to Regeneron, the time period for Regeneron to elect whether to exercise its right of first negotiation. On November 2, 2015, Regeneron notified the Company that it was not exercising this right of first negotiation.\nIn addition to AVA-101, we are working on other product candidates for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases, including:\n \u00b7 AVA-201. We are developing AVA-201 as a next-generation product candidate for the prevention of wet AMD. AVA-201 produces the same anti-VEGF protein as AVA-101 using a proprietary, customized delivery mechanism, or vector. \n \u00b7 AVA-311. As part of our research collaboration with Regeneron, AVA-311 is being evaluated in preclinical studies for the treatment of juvenile X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), a rare genetic disease of the retina with no approved therapy. There are approximately 10,000 boys and young men in the United States suffering from the disease. XLRS is caused by mutation of the RS1 gene and results in splitting of retinal layers and corresponding loss of vision. In preclinical studies in animals to date, AVA-311 has delayed the progression of XLRS and improved vision by delivering functional copies of the RS1 gene in retinal cells of mice. \n \u00b7 AVA-322 and AVA-323. We are developing AVA-322 and AVA-323 for the treatment of color vision deficiency (CVD), commonly known as red-green color blindness. CVD is a highly prevalent genetic disorder that affects approximately 8 percent of males and 0.5 percent of females, with some variation by race, and is most commonly caused by genetic mutations in the opsin genes that impact the ability of the cone cells to respond to various wavelengths of light in the retina. \nOn January 13, 2015, we completed a public offering of 2,369,375 shares of our common stock (Follow-on Offering), which included 359,918 shares we issued pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, and we received net proceeds of approximately $130.6 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\nIn March 2015, (i) the Company received net proceeds of approximately $8.3 million, after discounts and other issuance costs, which resulted from the sale of 230,000 common shares, and (ii) the Company issued 230,000 common shares to a stockholder that exercised warrants prior to the initial public offering.\nIn July 2015, the Company's then Chief Executive officer resigned and some of his stock-based awards were forfeited and cancelled, which resulted in $2.4 million of additional stock-based compensation expense recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated financial statements. He will continue providing services to the Company until July 2016 as a consultant.\nOn December 22, 2015, the Company implemented a restructuring plan to reduce operating costs and better align its workforce with the needs of its business following its decision to not initiate the Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 in the second half of 2015. The plan resulted in a reduction of approximately 20% of the Company's workforce. In connection with the restructuring, the Company recorded estimated restructuring charges of approximately $2.6 million related to one-time termination severance payments and other employee-related benefits, including approximately $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the acceleration of restricted stock unit awards in December 2015.\nOn January 29, 2016, the Company entered into an acquisition agreement (the Agreement) with Annapurna Therapeutics SAS (Annapurna), a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing gene therapy for unmet medical needs, certain shareholders of Annapurna (the Contributors), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, acting as the representative of the Contributors. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Agreement, the Company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Annapurna in exchange for approximately 13.1 million newly issued shares of the Company's common stock (the Company Common Stock), and the outstanding options or other rights to purchase capital stock of Annapurna (the Annapurna Options) will be converted into options relating to approximately 4.7 million shares of the Company Common Stock (the Company Options) (together with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Transaction). Each Company Option will relate to the whole number of shares of Company Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of the shares of the common stock of Annapurna subject to such Annapurna Option multiplied by 9.5615 (as may be adjusted pursuant to the Agreement, the Exchange Ratio). The exercise price per share for the Company Option will be equal to the exercise price per share of such Annapurna Option divided by the Exchange Ratio. Holders of Annapurna Options may exercise their Annapurna Options prior to the closing of the transaction, in which case each such exercising holder will become party to the Agreement as a Contributor and receive newly issued shares of the Company's common stock upon closing instead of Company Options. The transaction requires the Company's stockholders' vote and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.\nThe Agreement may be terminated by either party under certain circumstances as defined in the Agreement, including, among others, if the closing of the acquisition has not occurred by the six-month anniversary of the execution of the Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, or if the Company's stockholders fail to approve the issuance of the Company's stock (Company Stock Issuance).\nThe Agreement provides for the Company to pay to Annapurna a reverse termination fee of $4,000,000 if the Agreement is terminated by either party for the Company's failure to obtain the required vote of the Company's stockholders for the Company Stock Issuance or if the Agreement is terminated by Annapurna upon a certain defined triggering event. The Agreement also provides for the Company to pay to Annapurna termination fee of $6,000,000 (less the $4,000,000 termination fee described above, if paid) if the Agreement is terminated by either party for the failure to obtain the required vote of the Company's stockholders or by Annapurna upon certain other triggering events, and either (x) the Company consummates within twelve months of such termination an alternative transaction that was publicly announced or communicated in writing to the Company's board of directors prior to such termination or (y) the Company consummates within six months of such termination an alternative transaction that is first publicly announced or otherwise communicated in writing to the Company's board of directors following the termination of the Agreement while an alternative transaction described in the foregoing clause (x) remains outstanding and not withdrawn.\nFinancial Overview\nSummary\nWe have not generated positive cash flow or net income from operations since our inception and, at December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $84.2 million, primarily as a result of research and development, general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges. We expect to incur substantial losses from operations in the foreseeable future as we continue our research and development efforts, advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, manufacture clinical study materials, seek regulatory approval and prepare for, and if approved, proceed to commercialization. We are at an early stage of development and may never be successful in developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nSee Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital-We have incurred significant operating losses since inception, and we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may never become profitable or, if achieved, be able to sustain profitability.\u201d\nWhile we may in the future generate revenue from a variety of sources, including license fees, milestone and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and potentially revenue from approved product sales, we have not yet generated any revenue from approved therapeutic product candidates.\nPrior to the IPO, we financed our operations through private placements of convertible notes and preferred stock with our investors, funding under our government grants and revenue from research collaboration and license agreements. We entered into our first license revenue generating agreement during the first quarter of 2014. We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since commencement of our operations.\nWe have no manufacturing facilities, and all of our manufacturing activities are contracted out to a third party. Additionally, we currently utilize third-party clinical research organizations (CROs) to carry out our clinical development and we do not yet have a sales organization.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates, including conducting additional preclinical studies to inform further development of our wet AMD program. We will need substantial additional funding in the future to support our operating activities as we advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval and prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital, or to do so on acceptable terms, when needed, or to form additional collaboration partnerships to support our efforts, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or potential commercialization efforts.\nOn January 13, 2015, we completed a Follow-on Offering and we received net proceeds of approximately $130.6 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2015, we had $221.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $37.7 million of marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient funds to continue operations for the foreseeable future.\nRevenue\nTo date we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our products. In May 2014, we entered into a multi-year license and development agreement with Regeneron. Under the terms of the agreement, we received initial payments of $8.0 million that included payment for research license fees, prepaid collaboration research costs and the right of first negotiation for a potential license to develop and commercialize AVA-101. As the agreement provides for multiple deliverables, we account for this agreement as a multiple elements revenue arrangement. If deliverables do not appear to have a standalone fair value, they were combined with other deliverables into a unit of accounting with standalone fair value. We allocated the $8.0 million received to the fair values of the two units of accounting identified in the arrangement. We expect to recognize $6.5 million for research licenses and related research and development services ratably over the associated period of performance, which is the maximum research period of eight years. As there is no discernible pattern of performance and/or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, we will recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the eight-year performance period. The remaining $1.5 million allocated to the second unit of accounting for the time-limited right of first negotiation for AVA-101 was deferred. On November 2, 2015, Regeneron notified the management that it was not exercising this right of first negotiation and we recognized the entire $1.5 million as revenue in 2015.\nThe portion of the upfront payment that was applied to the original research budget was fully used in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the Company and Regeneron, through a joint review committee, will agree annually on an updated research and development services budget through the research period. The Company will invoice Regeneron quarterly for services performed in each prior quarter in accordance with the agreement with Regeneron. These additional research fees will be added to the research licenses and related research and development services unit of accounting, recorded as deferred revenue and recognized to revenue over the remaining maximum research term. The Company recognized $0.8 million as revenue related to this unit of accounting during the year ended December 31, 2015, and recorded $5.6 million of deferred revenue, including $0.9 million as current portion, and $0.4 million as receivable from collaboration partner as of December 31, 2015.\nOur ability to generate product revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the amount or timing of product revenue. Even if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of our products, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nConducting a significant amount of research and development is central to our business model. Research and development expenses include certain payroll and personnel expenses, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, external contract research and development expenses, including expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical study materials and overhead expenses, including rent, equipment depreciation, insurance and utilities.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods or services for future research and development activities are deferred and expensed as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\nWe estimate preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. We estimate the amounts incurred through communications with third party service providers and our estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date are based on information available at the time. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or aggregate costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of a product candidate is highly uncertain, and clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development and commercialization costs can differ materially from expectations.\nWe received refundable tax credits from the Australian tax authorities in connection with certain research costs incurred by our subsidiary conducting research in Australia. These refunds do not depend on our taxable income or tax position and therefore we do not account for them under an income tax accounting model. We recognize such refunds as government grants in the period when qualified expenses are incurred as a reduction of research expenses. We have recorded the reimbursement from the Australian tax authorities as a reduction of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the applicable period.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs, stock-based compensation, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development expenses. Our general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if and to the extent we elect to increase our investment in infrastructure to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We will continue to evaluate the need for such investment in conjunction with ongoing consideration of our pipeline of product candidates. We anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal and regulatory functions, as well as director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with being a public reporting company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net is comprised mainly of changes in the fair value of common stock warrant liabilities and preferred stock warrant liabilities in 2014 and interest income on our cash and investment in marketable securities in 2015. At the time of the IPO, all then outstanding warrants were exercised, and as a consequence, we do not expect to have any other income (expense), net related to changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities in future periods.\nIn April 2014, we recorded a $0.2 million loss related to the conversion of all outstanding convertible notes into Series B convertible preferred stock. In November 2013, we amended the terms of the convertible notes agreement to accelerate their conversion into shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, which we determined represented an extinguishment. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $1.7 million in 2013. We do not expect such charges in future periods as we have no outstanding convertible notes as of December 31, 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe have primarily generated revenue through a research and collaboration arrangement with a strategic partner for the development and commercialization of product candidates, and a license agreement related to the licensing of certain of our intellectual property. Additionally, we have historically generated grant revenue from research and development programs.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605). Accordingly, revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met:\n \u00b7 Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; \n \u00b7 Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; \n \u00b7 The seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and \n \u00b7 Collectability is reasonably assured. \nAmounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, current portion. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.\nIn May, 2014, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Regeneron. As a result, we are recognizing revenue under the agreement as discussed in Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nGovernment grants provide funds for certain types of expenditures in connection with research and development activities over a contractually defined period. Revenue related to government grants is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred and the related services are rendered, provided that the applicable performance obligations under the government grants have been met. We intend to continue to evaluate pursuing additional government grant opportunities on a case-by-case basis.\nAccrued Research and Development Expense\nWe estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, reviewing the terms of our license agreements, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. Expenses that are paid in advance of performance are deferred as a prepaid expense and expensed as the services are provided.\nExamples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees to:\n \u00b7 contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials; \n \u00b7 CROs and other service providers in connection with clinical studies; \n \u00b7 investigative sites in connection with clinical studies; \n \u00b7 vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and \n \u00b7 services providers for professional service fees such as consulting and related services. \nOur understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing may vary and may result in our reporting changes in estimates in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred. However, due to the nature of these estimates, we cannot assure you that we will not adjust our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical studies or other research activities.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock-based awards granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards to non-employees is recognized based on the then-current fair value at each measurement date over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term, using the accelerated attribution method. We have used the Black-Scholes valuation model to assist us in determining the fair value of stock-based awards. The Black-Scholes valuation model requires the use of subjective and highly complex assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units, or RSUs, are share awards that entitle the holder to receive freely tradable shares of our common stock upon vesting. The fair value of RSUs is based upon the closing sales price of our common stock on the grant date. RSUs granted to employees generally vest over a two-to-four year period.\nThere were no RSUs granted prior to April 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there was $6.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.\nStock Options Granted to Employees\nThe fair value of each option issued to employees was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, there was $14.2 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to employees' awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.\nStock Options Granted to Non-Employees\nWe used the following weighted-average assumptions in estimating non-employees stock-based compensation expense:\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, there was $1.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-employees' awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.\nExpected volatility. We estimate expected volatility based on the average historical volatility of a peer group of comparable publicly traded life sciences and biotechnology companies with product candidates in similar stages of clinical development, as we do not have sufficient trading history for our common stock. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.\nExpected term. We derived the expected term using the simplified\u201d method (the expected term is determined as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options), as we have limited historical information to develop expectations about future exercise patterns and post vesting employment termination behavior. Expected term for non-employee awards is based on the remaining contractual term of an option on each measurement date. The expected term of the ESPP rights equals to the six-month look-back period.\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.\nExpected dividend yield. We have never paid any dividends and do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, used an expected dividend yield of zero in the valuation model.\nForfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent actual forfeitures differ from the estimates, the difference will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period that the estimates are revised.\nThe following table sets forth our total stock-based compensation expense for awards granted in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n\nFair value of common stock. The fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our stock options has historically been determined by our board of directors. Because there has been no public market for our common stock and in the absence of recent arm's-length cash sales transactions of our common stock with independent third parties, our board of directors has determined the fair value of our common stock by considering at the time of grant a number of objective and subjective factors, including the following: independent third-party valuations as of December 31, 2012, March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, September 30, 2013, December 31, 2013, March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014; progress of research and development activities; our operating and financial performance, including our levels of available capital resources; rights and preferences of our common stock compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity securities; equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies, as reflected in comparable companies' market multiples, initial public offering (IPO) valuations and other metrics; the achievement of enterprise milestones, including our progress in clinical trials and potential collaborations with partners; the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock, such as an IPO given prevailing market and biotechnology sector conditions; sales of our convertible preferred stock in arms-length transactions; the illiquidity of our securities by virtue of being a private company; business risks; and management and board experience.\nThe independent third-party valuations used the income, guideline and transaction approaches based on our expected future cash flows and applied a discount for lack of marketability. The guideline approach measures value on a minority-interest basis; the transaction and income approaches measure value on a controlling basis. This approach is outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation\u201d as the probability-weighted expected return method (PWERM). Enterprise values were calculated based on three exit scenarios, including an IPO, a partnership for the development of our product candidate either in an earlier stage or a late stage of clinical development and a corporate failure. Each value was weighted based on the probability of each event's occurrence to arrive at an indicated enterprise value. In estimating the value of equities, management estimated a term for each of the IPO, partnership or corporate failure scenarios.\nFollowing the completion of our IPO in August 2014, the fair value of our common stock generally is determined by reference to the closing sales price of a share of our common stock on the grant date.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nIn October 2015, in connection with an amendment to our research agreement with LEI, we issued a warrant to LEI to purchase 40,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $10.51 per share. This common stock warrant is exercisable immediately, and expires on October 15, 2020. The Company estimated the fair value of this warrant to be approximately $0.2 million which was recorded as a debit to research and development expenses and a credit to additional paid-in capital upon issuance. The fair value of the warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and was based on the closing price of our common stock on the issuance date of $8.35 per share, the exercise price of $10.51, the contractual term of the warrant of 5 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.34%, an expected volatility of 75% and a 0% expected dividend yield.\nThe amendment also provides for the issuance of an additional warrant to LEI to purchase up to 40,000 shares of the Company's common stock upon completion of the 36 month follow-up on the Phase 2a AVA-101 clinical study (Contingent Warrant). As of December 31, 2015, none of the shares subject to the Contingent Warrant were vested and exercisable. The Company is accounting for this warrant as a stock-based award issued for service and estimated the fair value of the costs associated with the service performed to be approximately $30,000 which was recorded as a debit to research and development expenses and a credit to additional paid-in capital in 2015. The fair value of the Contingent Warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and was based on the closing price of common stock on December 31, 2015 of $9.52 per share, the expected term of the warrants of 6.6 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.1%, an expected volatility of 79% and a 0% expected dividend yield.\nIncome Tax\nWe recognize deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. We periodically evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon realizability of our deferred tax assets. Based upon the weight of available evidence, which includes our historical operating performance, reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results, we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 of approximately $28.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $79.4 million to offset future federal income. NOLs expire at various years beginning with 2026. As of December 31, 2015, the Company also had U.S. state NOL carryforwards of approximately $56.5 million to offset future state income. U.S. State NOLs expire at various years beginning with 2016. At December 31, 2015, the Company also had approximately $0.2 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards which may be available to offset future foreign income; these carryforwards do not expire.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we have experienced an ownership change.\u201d Generally, a Section 382 ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative increase of more than 50 percentage points in the stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of a corporation's stock within a specified testing period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We believe that we have experienced at least two ownership changes under Section 382 which will result in limitations in our ability to utilized net operating losses and credits. In addition, we may experience ownership changes as a result of our previous or future offerings or other changes in the ownership of our stock. As a result, the amount of the NOL carryforwards and research and credit carryforwards presented in our financial statements could be limited and may expire unutilized.\nWe record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. No interest and penalties related to income taxes have been recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss in 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, requiring management to evaluate whether events or conditions could impact an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures if necessary. Management will be required to perform the evaluation within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure will be determined based on whether management's plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt. The accounting standards update will be effective for the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early application permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to impact the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the FASB approved deferral of the effective date of this ASU by one year to December 15, 2017. The ASU's effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2018. The Company is evaluating the application of this ASU, but has not yet determined the potential effects it may have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Customer's Accounting of Fees Paid in Cloud Computing Arrangement, guidance on accounting for fees paid in cloud computing arrangements. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a services contract. All software licenses recognized under this guidance will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. The guidance becomes effective for the Company for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as non-current simplifies entities' processes as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non-current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowances. The Company elected to retrospectively adopt this accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements due to full valuation allowance recorded on our deferred taxes.\nOn January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for certain changes. The Company has not yet determined the potential effects the new standard will have of the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated:\n\nRevenue\nCollaboration revenue increased by $1.7 million to $2.3 million in 2015 from $0.6 million in 2014. In September 2015, we initiated, by notice and delivery of AVA-101 clinical data package to Regeneron, the time period for Regeneron to elect whether to exercise its right of first negotiation. In November 2015, Regeneron notified the Company that it was not exercising the right of first negotiation and the Company recognized $1.5 million related to the right of first negotiation as collaboration revenue in 2015. Collaboration revenue related to research licenses and related research and development services that we recognize ratably over the maximum research period of 8 years, was $0.8 million and $0.6 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014 years respectively.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increases of $5.7 million in salaries and related expenses due to increased employee headcount, $3.3 million in drug product process development expenses, clinical expenses, laboratory expenses and overhead and $2.4 million in external consulting expenses and research studies. The increase in research and development expenses was also due to a $0.2 million non-cash stock compensation charge related to the issuance of a common stock warrant. The increase was offset by $3.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses, as most of the expense related to non-employee stock option awards that are remeasured based on the price of our common stock at December 31, 2015.\nFor the periods presented, substantially all of our research and development expense related to development activities for AVA-101, for the treatment of wet AMD, and our other potential product candidates in our development program. We expect research and development expenses may increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our pipeline products and preclinical studies relating to our wet AMD program.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to expense increases of $3.6 million in salaries and expenses related to increased employee headcount, $5.2 million in stock-based compensation expenses, $1.9 million in public company-related expenses and overhead and $3.3 million in consulting and professional service expenses, as we expanded our operations and operated as a public company.\nWe expect general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if and to the extent we elect to increase our investment in infrastructure to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We will continue to assess such expenses in conjunction with ongoing consideration of our pipeline of product candidates. We anticipate increased costs in connection with increased professional fees associated with being a public company.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn connection with the restructuring, the Company estimates that it will incur aggregate restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2015 of approximately $2.6 million related to one-time termination severance payments and other employee-related benefits, including approximately $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the acceleration of restricted stock units.\nOther income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net is comprised mainly of changes in the fair value of common stock warrant liabilities and preferred stock warrant liabilities in 2014 and interest income on our cash and investment in marketable securities in 2015. At the time of the IPO, all then outstanding warrants classified as liabilities were exercised, and as a consequence, the Company does not expect to have any other income (expense), net related to changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities in future periods.\nChanges in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities\nWe recorded changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In connection with the completion of the IPO in August 2014, all of the then outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock were exercised. As a result of the exercises, we recorded a $0.8 million loss related to the change in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Related Party Convertible Notes\nIn April 2014, we converted the outstanding balance under our related-party convertible notes of $2.0 million into 295,115 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock at 90% of the purchase price paid by other investors, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $0.2 million in 2014.\nDeemed Dividend\nIn April 2014, we repurchased 531,208 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock for $4.0 million. The difference between the repurchase price of $7.53 per share and original issuance price of $1.45 per share was recorded as a deemed dividend of $3.2 million to a preferred stockholder and effected the calculation of net loss attributable to common stockholders and net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated:\n\nRevenue\nCollaboration and license revenue increased by $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as we recognized revenue from the Regeneron agreement and from a license agreement entered into during the first quarter of 2014. Government grant revenue decreased to zero for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as we completed the work performed under the government grants during the 2013 fiscal year.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increases of $7.0 million in stock-based compensation expenses, $3.0 million in expenses related to an increase in our employee headcount, $2.5 million in drug product process development expenses and laboratory supplies and $1.6 million in external consulting expenses and research studies. Expenses during the year ended December 31, 2013 benefited from reimbursement of $0.8 million from the Australian tax authorities recorded as a reduction in research and development expense as compared to $0.1 million during 2014. For the periods presented, substantially all of our research and development expense related to our development activity for AVA-101 for the treatment of wet AMD, and the other potential product candidates in our development program. We expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our pipeline products and AVA-101 in late-stage clinical trials.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases of $1.8 million related in an increase in our employee headcount, $1.1 million in stock-based compensation expenses, $1.6 million in public company-related expenses and overhead and $2.5 million in consulting and professional service expenses, as we expanded our operations. We also recorded a $0.8 million non-cash one-time charge of collaboration acquisition costs in 2013 related to the issuance of 689,655 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to a potential collaborator for cash at a price per share below the fair value of such shares. We expect general and administrative costs to increase in future periods, reflecting both the increased costs in connection with the future commercialization of AVA-101 and our pipeline products, as well as an expanded infrastructure and increased professional fees associated with being a public company.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased to $18,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $73,000 for the comparable period in 2013 as outstanding convertible notes were converted into Series B convertible preferred stock in April 2014.\nChanges in Fair Value of Embedded Derivative\nWe recorded an embedded derivative liability in connection with our 2012 Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded income of $18,000 for the change in fair value of the embedded derivative liability. In November 2013, upon conversion of the 2012 Notes into Series A convertible preferred stock, the embedded derivative was reversed.\nChanges in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities\nWe recorded changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to ($92,000) for the year ended December 31, 2013. In connection with the completion of the IPO in August 2014, all of the then outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock were exercised. As a result of the exercises, we recorded a $0.8 million loss related to the change in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Related Party Convertible Notes\nIn April 2014, we converted the outstanding balance under our related-party convertible notes of $2.0 million into 295,115 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock at 90% of the purchase price paid by other investors, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $0.2 million in 2014.\nIn November 2013, we amended the terms of the convertible notes agreement to accelerate their conversion into shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, which we determined represented an extinguishment. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $1.7 million in 2013.\nDeemed Dividend\nIn April 2014, we repurchased 531,208 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock for $4.0 million. The difference between the repurchase price of $7.53 per share and original issuance price of $1.45 per share was recorded as a deemed dividend of $3.2 million to a preferred stockholder and effected the calculation of net loss attributable to common stockholders and net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Plan of Operations\nWe have not generated positive cash flow or net income from operations since our inception and at December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $84.2 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administration expenses. On January 13, 2015, we completed a Follow-on Offering and we received net proceeds of approximately $130.6 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2015, we had $221.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $37.7 million of marketable securities invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agencies securities with maturities of 12 months or less. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2015 will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future and, if the acquisition of Annapurna is consummated, sufficient to fund the combined company's operations for at least the next 36 months.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and ongoing internal research and development programs. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or aggregate amount of such costs. However, in order to complete our planned preclinical trials and any future clinical trials, and to complete the process of obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, as well as to build the sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure that we believe will be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, we will require substantial additional funding in the future.\nIf and when we seek additional funding, we will do so through equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a gene therapy company committed to discovering and developing novel medicines that can offer potentially life-changing therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from chronic or debilitating disease. We have leveraged our next-generation gene therapy platform to create a pipeline of product candidates. Our product candidates are designed to provide durable efficacy by inducing sustained expression of a therapeutic protein.\nWe are targeting diseases with unmet medical need, including ophthalmic diseases such as wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), as well as rare genetic diseases. We believe that there are several important benefits to focusing on the development of rare genetic diseases including the following:\n \u00b7 well-known disease pathways which we believe are particularly amenable to gene therapy, especially in conditions that are caused by a defect in expression of a single gene; \n \u00b7 gene therapy is believed to offer a versatile protein delivery system with persistent expression; \n \u00b7 local delivery of the therapeutic protein; and \n \u00b7 significant market demand for therapies that can offer long-term clinical benefit with potentially a one-time administration. \nFor ophthalmic diseases, such as wet AMD, there are further benefits including the following:\n \u00b7 reduced risk of harmful immune responses and systemic side effects due to localized delivery in a self-contained organ; and \n \u00b7 well-defined and objective clinical endpoints such as the ability to read an eye chart. \nTo date, our primary focus has been the development of AVA-101 for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). We generated human proof-of-concept data for AVA-101 in a Phase 1 trial with eight wet AMD subjects conducted at Lions Eye Institute (LEI) in Australia, of whom six were randomized to treatment with AVA-101 and two to standard-of-care therapy in the form of ranibizumab injections on an as-needed basis per protocol. Six of these subjects were available for evaluation at 36 months, and of these six subjects, four were treated with AVA-101. In June 2015, we announced the 36-month follow-up data on the six subjects, which confirmed the safety profile of the drug previously reported at 12 months.\nAdditionally, we conducted a Phase 2a trial for AVA-101 at LEI with 32 additional wet AMD subjects, for which we announced top-line results in June 2015. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2a study was based on ophthalmic and systemic safety, and secondary endpoints included retinal thickness (which can be a sign of reoccurrence of fluid in the retina), visual acuity and the need for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in the form of rescue injections with ranibizumab. The Phase 2a clinical study met its 12-month primary endpoint, demonstrating that AVA-101 was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile in subjects with wet AMD. No serious adverse events related to AVA-101 were observed. Overall, we did not observe evidence of a complete and/or durable anti-VEGF response in the majority of subjects treated with AVA-101 as administered in the Phase 2a study. We decided not to move forward with the Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 with the dose and administration procedure that we had planned to initiate in the second half of 2015. Instead, we are conducting additional preclinical studies to inform further development of our wet AMD program.\nRegeneron had a time-limited right of first negotiation for certain rights to AVA-101 as part of our collaboration. In September 2015, we initiated, by notice and delivery of AVA-101 clinical data to Regeneron, the time period for Regeneron to elect whether to exercise its right of first negotiation. On November 2, 2015, Regeneron notified the Company that it was not exercising this right of first negotiation.\nIn addition to AVA-101, we are working on other product candidates for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases, including:\n \u00b7 AVA-201. We are developing AVA-201 as a next-generation product candidate for the prevention of wet AMD. AVA-201 produces the same anti-VEGF protein as AVA-101 using a proprietary, customized delivery mechanism, or vector. \n \u00b7 AVA-311. As part of our research collaboration with Regeneron, AVA-311 is being evaluated in preclinical studies for the treatment of juvenile X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), a rare genetic disease of the retina with no approved therapy. There are approximately 10,000 boys and young men in the United States suffering from the disease. XLRS is caused by mutation of the RS1 gene and results in splitting of retinal layers and corresponding loss of vision. In preclinical studies in animals to date, AVA-311 has delayed the progression of XLRS and improved vision by delivering functional copies of the RS1 gene in retinal cells of mice. \n \u00b7 AVA-322 and AVA-323. We are developing AVA-322 and AVA-323 for the treatment of color vision deficiency (CVD), commonly known as red-green color blindness. CVD is a highly prevalent genetic disorder that affects approximately 8 percent of males and 0.5 percent of females, with some variation by race, and is most commonly caused by genetic mutations in the opsin genes that impact the ability of the cone cells to respond to various wavelengths of light in the retina. \nOn January 13, 2015, we completed a public offering of 2,369,375 shares of our common stock (Follow-on Offering), which included 359,918 shares we issued pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, and we received net proceeds of approximately $130.6 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\nIn March 2015, (i) the Company received net proceeds of approximately $8.3 million, after discounts and other issuance costs, which resulted from the sale of 230,000 common shares, and (ii) the Company issued 230,000 common shares to a stockholder that exercised warrants prior to the initial public offering.\nIn July 2015, the Company's then Chief Executive officer resigned and some of his stock-based awards were forfeited and cancelled, which resulted in $2.4 million of additional stock-based compensation expense recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated financial statements. He will continue providing services to the Company until July 2016 as a consultant.\nOn December 22, 2015, the Company implemented a restructuring plan to reduce operating costs and better align its workforce with the needs of its business following its decision to not initiate the Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 in the second half of 2015. The plan resulted in a reduction of approximately 20% of the Company's workforce. In connection with the restructuring, the Company recorded estimated restructuring charges of approximately $2.6 million related to one-time termination severance payments and other employee-related benefits, including approximately $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the acceleration of restricted stock unit awards in December 2015.\nOn January 29, 2016, the Company entered into an acquisition agreement (the Agreement) with Annapurna Therapeutics SAS (Annapurna), a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing gene therapy for unmet medical needs, certain shareholders of Annapurna (the Contributors), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, acting as the representative of the Contributors. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Agreement, the Company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Annapurna in exchange for approximately 13.1 million newly issued shares of the Company's common stock (the Company Common Stock), and the outstanding options or other rights to purchase capital stock of Annapurna (the Annapurna Options) will be converted into options relating to approximately 4.7 million shares of the Company Common Stock (the Company Options) (together with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Transaction). Each Company Option will relate to the whole number of shares of Company Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of the shares of the common stock of Annapurna subject to such Annapurna Option multiplied by 9.5615 (as may be adjusted pursuant to the Agreement, the Exchange Ratio). The exercise price per share for the Company Option will be equal to the exercise price per share of such Annapurna Option divided by the Exchange Ratio. Holders of Annapurna Options may exercise their Annapurna Options prior to the closing of the transaction, in which case each such exercising holder will become party to the Agreement as a Contributor and receive newly issued shares of the Company's common stock upon closing instead of Company Options. The transaction requires the Company's stockholders' vote and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.\nThe Agreement may be terminated by either party under certain circumstances as defined in the Agreement, including, among others, if the closing of the acquisition has not occurred by the six-month anniversary of the execution of the Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, or if the Company's stockholders fail to approve the issuance of the Company's stock (Company Stock Issuance).\nThe Agreement provides for the Company to pay to Annapurna a reverse termination fee of $4,000,000 if the Agreement is terminated by either party for the Company's failure to obtain the required vote of the Company's stockholders for the Company Stock Issuance or if the Agreement is terminated by Annapurna upon a certain defined triggering event. The Agreement also provides for the Company to pay to Annapurna termination fee of $6,000,000 (less the $4,000,000 termination fee described above, if paid) if the Agreement is terminated by either party for the failure to obtain the required vote of the Company's stockholders or by Annapurna upon certain other triggering events, and either (x) the Company consummates within twelve months of such termination an alternative transaction that was publicly announced or communicated in writing to the Company's board of directors prior to such termination or (y) the Company consummates within six months of such termination an alternative transaction that is first publicly announced or otherwise communicated in writing to the Company's board of directors following the termination of the Agreement while an alternative transaction described in the foregoing clause (x) remains outstanding and not withdrawn.\nFinancial Overview\nSummary\nWe have not generated positive cash flow or net income from operations since our inception and, at December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $84.2 million, primarily as a result of research and development, general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges. We expect to incur substantial losses from operations in the foreseeable future as we continue our research and development efforts, advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, manufacture clinical study materials, seek regulatory approval and prepare for, and if approved, proceed to commercialization. We are at an early stage of development and may never be successful in developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nSee Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital-We have incurred significant operating losses since inception, and we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may never become profitable or, if achieved, be able to sustain profitability.\u201d\nWhile we may in the future generate revenue from a variety of sources, including license fees, milestone and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and potentially revenue from approved product sales, we have not yet generated any revenue from approved therapeutic product candidates.\nPrior to the IPO, we financed our operations through private placements of convertible notes and preferred stock with our investors, funding under our government grants and revenue from research collaboration and license agreements. We entered into our first license revenue generating agreement during the first quarter of 2014. We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since commencement of our operations.\nWe have no manufacturing facilities, and all of our manufacturing activities are contracted out to a third party. Additionally, we currently utilize third-party clinical research organizations (CROs) to carry out our clinical development and we do not yet have a sales organization.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates, including conducting additional preclinical studies to inform further development of our wet AMD program. We will need substantial additional funding in the future to support our operating activities as we advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval and prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital, or to do so on acceptable terms, when needed, or to form additional collaboration partnerships to support our efforts, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or potential commercialization efforts.\nOn January 13, 2015, we completed a Follow-on Offering and we received net proceeds of approximately $130.6 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2015, we had $221.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $37.7 million of marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient funds to continue operations for the foreseeable future.\nRevenue\nTo date we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our products. In May 2014, we entered into a multi-year license and development agreement with Regeneron. Under the terms of the agreement, we received initial payments of $8.0 million that included payment for research license fees, prepaid collaboration research costs and the right of first negotiation for a potential license to develop and commercialize AVA-101. As the agreement provides for multiple deliverables, we account for this agreement as a multiple elements revenue arrangement. If deliverables do not appear to have a standalone fair value, they were combined with other deliverables into a unit of accounting with standalone fair value. We allocated the $8.0 million received to the fair values of the two units of accounting identified in the arrangement. We expect to recognize $6.5 million for research licenses and related research and development services ratably over the associated period of performance, which is the maximum research period of eight years. As there is no discernible pattern of performance and/or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, we will recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the eight-year performance period. The remaining $1.5 million allocated to the second unit of accounting for the time-limited right of first negotiation for AVA-101 was deferred. On November 2, 2015, Regeneron notified the management that it was not exercising this right of first negotiation and we recognized the entire $1.5 million as revenue in 2015.\nThe portion of the upfront payment that was applied to the original research budget was fully used in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the Company and Regeneron, through a joint review committee, will agree annually on an updated research and development services budget through the research period. The Company will invoice Regeneron quarterly for services performed in each prior quarter in accordance with the agreement with Regeneron. These additional research fees will be added to the research licenses and related research and development services unit of accounting, recorded as deferred revenue and recognized to revenue over the remaining maximum research term. The Company recognized $0.8 million as revenue related to this unit of accounting during the year ended December 31, 2015, and recorded $5.6 million of deferred revenue, including $0.9 million as current portion, and $0.4 million as receivable from collaboration partner as of December 31, 2015.\nOur ability to generate product revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the amount or timing of product revenue. Even if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of our products, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nConducting a significant amount of research and development is central to our business model. Research and development expenses include certain payroll and personnel expenses, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, external contract research and development expenses, including expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical study materials and overhead expenses, including rent, equipment depreciation, insurance and utilities.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods or services for future research and development activities are deferred and expensed as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\nWe estimate preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. We estimate the amounts incurred through communications with third party service providers and our estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date are based on information available at the time. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or aggregate costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of a product candidate is highly uncertain, and clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development and commercialization costs can differ materially from expectations.\nWe received refundable tax credits from the Australian tax authorities in connection with certain research costs incurred by our subsidiary conducting research in Australia. These refunds do not depend on our taxable income or tax position and therefore we do not account for them under an income tax accounting model. We recognize such refunds as government grants in the period when qualified expenses are incurred as a reduction of research expenses. We have recorded the reimbursement from the Australian tax authorities as a reduction of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the applicable period.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs, stock-based compensation, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development expenses. Our general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if and to the extent we elect to increase our investment in infrastructure to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We will continue to evaluate the need for such investment in conjunction with ongoing consideration of our pipeline of product candidates. We anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal and regulatory functions, as well as director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with being a public reporting company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net is comprised mainly of changes in the fair value of common stock warrant liabilities and preferred stock warrant liabilities in 2014 and interest income on our cash and investment in marketable securities in 2015. At the time of the IPO, all then outstanding warrants were exercised, and as a consequence, we do not expect to have any other income (expense), net related to changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities in future periods.\nIn April 2014, we recorded a $0.2 million loss related to the conversion of all outstanding convertible notes into Series B convertible preferred stock. In November 2013, we amended the terms of the convertible notes agreement to accelerate their conversion into shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, which we determined represented an extinguishment. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $1.7 million in 2013. We do not expect such charges in future periods as we have no outstanding convertible notes as of December 31, 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe have primarily generated revenue through a research and collaboration arrangement with a strategic partner for the development and commercialization of product candidates, and a license agreement related to the licensing of certain of our intellectual property. Additionally, we have historically generated grant revenue from research and development programs.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605). Accordingly, revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met:\n \u00b7 Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; \n \u00b7 Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; \n \u00b7 The seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and \n \u00b7 Collectability is reasonably assured. \nAmounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, current portion. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.\nIn May, 2014, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Regeneron. As a result, we are recognizing revenue under the agreement as discussed in Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nGovernment grants provide funds for certain types of expenditures in connection with research and development activities over a contractually defined period. Revenue related to government grants is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred and the related services are rendered, provided that the applicable performance obligations under the government grants have been met. We intend to continue to evaluate pursuing additional government grant opportunities on a case-by-case basis.\nAccrued Research and Development Expense\nWe estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, reviewing the terms of our license agreements, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. Expenses that are paid in advance of performance are deferred as a prepaid expense and expensed as the services are provided.\nExamples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees to:\n \u00b7 contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials; \n \u00b7 CROs and other service providers in connection with clinical studies; \n \u00b7 investigative sites in connection with clinical studies; \n \u00b7 vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and \n \u00b7 services providers for professional service fees such as consulting and related services. \nOur understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing may vary and may result in our reporting changes in estimates in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred. However, due to the nature of these estimates, we cannot assure you that we will not adjust our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical studies or other research activities.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock-based awards granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards to non-employees is recognized based on the then-current fair value at each measurement date over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term, using the accelerated attribution method. We have used the Black-Scholes valuation model to assist us in determining the fair value of stock-based awards. The Black-Scholes valuation model requires the use of subjective and highly complex assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units, or RSUs, are share awards that entitle the holder to receive freely tradable shares of our common stock upon vesting. The fair value of RSUs is based upon the closing sales price of our common stock on the grant date. RSUs granted to employees generally vest over a two-to-four year period.\nThere were no RSUs granted prior to April 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there was $6.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.\nStock Options Granted to Employees\nThe fair value of each option issued to employees was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nTable 304: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Options\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, there was $14.2 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to employees' awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.\nStock Options Granted to Non-Employees\nWe used the following weighted-average assumptions in estimating non-employees stock-based compensation expense:\nTable 305: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Option grants:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, there was $1.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-employees' awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.\nExpected volatility. We estimate expected volatility based on the average historical volatility of a peer group of comparable publicly traded life sciences and biotechnology companies with product candidates in similar stages of clinical development, as we do not have sufficient trading history for our common stock. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.\nExpected term. We derived the expected term using the simplified\u201d method (the expected term is determined as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options), as we have limited historical information to develop expectations about future exercise patterns and post vesting employment termination behavior. Expected term for non-employee awards is based on the remaining contractual term of an option on each measurement date. The expected term of the ESPP rights equals to the six-month look-back period.\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.\nExpected dividend yield. We have never paid any dividends and do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, used an expected dividend yield of zero in the valuation model.\nForfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent actual forfeitures differ from the estimates, the difference will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period that the estimates are revised.\nThe following table sets forth our total stock-based compensation expense for awards granted in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 306: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value of common stock. The fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our stock options has historically been determined by our board of directors. Because there has been no public market for our common stock and in the absence of recent arm's-length cash sales transactions of our common stock with independent third parties, our board of directors has determined the fair value of our common stock by considering at the time of grant a number of objective and subjective factors, including the following: independent third-party valuations as of December 31, 2012, March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, September 30, 2013, December 31, 2013, March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014; progress of research and development activities; our operating and financial performance, including our levels of available capital resources; rights and preferences of our common stock compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity securities; equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies, as reflected in comparable companies' market multiples, initial public offering (IPO) valuations and other metrics; the achievement of enterprise milestones, including our progress in clinical trials and potential collaborations with partners; the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock, such as an IPO given prevailing market and biotechnology sector conditions; sales of our convertible preferred stock in arms-length transactions; the illiquidity of our securities by virtue of being a private company; business risks; and management and board experience.\nThe independent third-party valuations used the income, guideline and transaction approaches based on our expected future cash flows and applied a discount for lack of marketability. The guideline approach measures value on a minority-interest basis; the transaction and income approaches measure value on a controlling basis. This approach is outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation\u201d as the probability-weighted expected return method (PWERM). Enterprise values were calculated based on three exit scenarios, including an IPO, a partnership for the development of our product candidate either in an earlier stage or a late stage of clinical development and a corporate failure. Each value was weighted based on the probability of each event's occurrence to arrive at an indicated enterprise value. In estimating the value of equities, management estimated a term for each of the IPO, partnership or corporate failure scenarios.\nFollowing the completion of our IPO in August 2014, the fair value of our common stock generally is determined by reference to the closing sales price of a share of our common stock on the grant date.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nIn October 2015, in connection with an amendment to our research agreement with LEI, we issued a warrant to LEI to purchase 40,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $10.51 per share. This common stock warrant is exercisable immediately, and expires on October 15, 2020. The Company estimated the fair value of this warrant to be approximately $0.2 million which was recorded as a debit to research and development expenses and a credit to additional paid-in capital upon issuance. The fair value of the warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and was based on the closing price of our common stock on the issuance date of $8.35 per share, the exercise price of $10.51, the contractual term of the warrant of 5 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.34%, an expected volatility of 75% and a 0% expected dividend yield.\nThe amendment also provides for the issuance of an additional warrant to LEI to purchase up to 40,000 shares of the Company's common stock upon completion of the 36 month follow-up on the Phase 2a AVA-101 clinical study (Contingent Warrant). As of December 31, 2015, none of the shares subject to the Contingent Warrant were vested and exercisable. The Company is accounting for this warrant as a stock-based award issued for service and estimated the fair value of the costs associated with the service performed to be approximately $30,000 which was recorded as a debit to research and development expenses and a credit to additional paid-in capital in 2015. The fair value of the Contingent Warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and was based on the closing price of common stock on December 31, 2015 of $9.52 per share, the expected term of the warrants of 6.6 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.1%, an expected volatility of 79% and a 0% expected dividend yield.\nIncome Tax\nWe recognize deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. We periodically evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon realizability of our deferred tax assets. Based upon the weight of available evidence, which includes our historical operating performance, reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results, we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 of approximately $28.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $79.4 million to offset future federal income. NOLs expire at various years beginning with 2026. As of December 31, 2015, the Company also had U.S. state NOL carryforwards of approximately $56.5 million to offset future state income. U.S. State NOLs expire at various years beginning with 2016. At December 31, 2015, the Company also had approximately $0.2 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards which may be available to offset future foreign income; these carryforwards do not expire.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we have experienced an ownership change.\u201d Generally, a Section 382 ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative increase of more than 50 percentage points in the stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of a corporation's stock within a specified testing period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We believe that we have experienced at least two ownership changes under Section 382 which will result in limitations in our ability to utilized net operating losses and credits. In addition, we may experience ownership changes as a result of our previous or future offerings or other changes in the ownership of our stock. As a result, the amount of the NOL carryforwards and research and credit carryforwards presented in our financial statements could be limited and may expire unutilized.\nWe record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. No interest and penalties related to income taxes have been recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss in 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, requiring management to evaluate whether events or conditions could impact an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures if necessary. Management will be required to perform the evaluation within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure will be determined based on whether management's plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt. The accounting standards update will be effective for the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early application permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to impact the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the FASB approved deferral of the effective date of this ASU by one year to December 15, 2017. The ASU's effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2018. The Company is evaluating the application of this ASU, but has not yet determined the potential effects it may have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Customer's Accounting of Fees Paid in Cloud Computing Arrangement, guidance on accounting for fees paid in cloud computing arrangements. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a services contract. All software licenses recognized under this guidance will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. The guidance becomes effective for the Company for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as non-current simplifies entities' processes as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non-current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowances. The Company elected to retrospectively adopt this accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements due to full valuation allowance recorded on our deferred taxes.\nOn January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for certain changes. The Company has not yet determined the potential effects the new standard will have of the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 307: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED\nDECEMBER 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> INCREASE/\n(DECREASE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,823\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,402\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,421\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of warrant liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of related-party\nconvertible notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,453\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25,404\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,049\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deemed dividend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,230\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (47,453\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,634\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (18,819\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nCollaboration revenue increased by $1.7 million to $2.3 million in 2015 from $0.6 million in 2014. In September 2015, we initiated, by notice and delivery of AVA-101 clinical data package to Regeneron, the time period for Regeneron to elect whether to exercise its right of first negotiation. In November 2015, Regeneron notified the Company that it was not exercising the right of first negotiation and the Company recognized $1.5 million related to the right of first negotiation as collaboration revenue in 2015. Collaboration revenue related to research licenses and related research and development services that we recognize ratably over the maximum research period of 8 years, was $0.8 million and $0.6 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014 years respectively.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increases of $5.7 million in salaries and related expenses due to increased employee headcount, $3.3 million in drug product process development expenses, clinical expenses, laboratory expenses and overhead and $2.4 million in external consulting expenses and research studies. The increase in research and development expenses was also due to a $0.2 million non-cash stock compensation charge related to the issuance of a common stock warrant. The increase was offset by $3.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses, as most of the expense related to non-employee stock option awards that are remeasured based on the price of our common stock at December 31, 2015.\nFor the periods presented, substantially all of our research and development expense related to development activities for AVA-101, for the treatment of wet AMD, and our other potential product candidates in our development program. We expect research and development expenses may increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our pipeline products and preclinical studies relating to our wet AMD program.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to expense increases of $3.6 million in salaries and expenses related to increased employee headcount, $5.2 million in stock-based compensation expenses, $1.9 million in public company-related expenses and overhead and $3.3 million in consulting and professional service expenses, as we expanded our operations and operated as a public company.\nWe expect general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if and to the extent we elect to increase our investment in infrastructure to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We will continue to assess such expenses in conjunction with ongoing consideration of our pipeline of product candidates. We anticipate increased costs in connection with increased professional fees associated with being a public company.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn connection with the restructuring, the Company estimates that it will incur aggregate restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2015 of approximately $2.6 million related to one-time termination severance payments and other employee-related benefits, including approximately $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the acceleration of restricted stock units.\nOther income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net is comprised mainly of changes in the fair value of common stock warrant liabilities and preferred stock warrant liabilities in 2014 and interest income on our cash and investment in marketable securities in 2015. At the time of the IPO, all then outstanding warrants classified as liabilities were exercised, and as a consequence, the Company does not expect to have any other income (expense), net related to changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities in future periods.\nChanges in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities\nWe recorded changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In connection with the completion of the IPO in August 2014, all of the then outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock were exercised. As a result of the exercises, we recorded a $0.8 million loss related to the change in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Related Party Convertible Notes\nIn April 2014, we converted the outstanding balance under our related-party convertible notes of $2.0 million into 295,115 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock at 90% of the purchase price paid by other investors, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $0.2 million in 2014.\nDeemed Dividend\nIn April 2014, we repurchased 531,208 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock for $4.0 million. The difference between the repurchase price of $7.53 per share and original issuance price of $1.45 per share was recorded as a deemed dividend of $3.2 million to a preferred stockholder and effected the calculation of net loss attributable to common stockholders and net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 308: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED\nDECEMBER 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> INCREASE/\n(DECREASE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government grant revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (480\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,402\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,454\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,948\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of embedded derivative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of warrant liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (92\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (667\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of related-party\nconvertible notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,671\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25,404\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,276\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,128\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deemed dividend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,230\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,230\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,634\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,276\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,358\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nCollaboration and license revenue increased by $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as we recognized revenue from the Regeneron agreement and from a license agreement entered into during the first quarter of 2014. Government grant revenue decreased to zero for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as we completed the work performed under the government grants during the 2013 fiscal year.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increases of $7.0 million in stock-based compensation expenses, $3.0 million in expenses related to an increase in our employee headcount, $2.5 million in drug product process development expenses and laboratory supplies and $1.6 million in external consulting expenses and research studies. Expenses during the year ended December 31, 2013 benefited from reimbursement of $0.8 million from the Australian tax authorities recorded as a reduction in research and development expense as compared to $0.1 million during 2014. For the periods presented, substantially all of our research and development expense related to our development activity for AVA-101 for the treatment of wet AMD, and the other potential product candidates in our development program. We expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our pipeline products and AVA-101 in late-stage clinical trials.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases of $1.8 million related in an increase in our employee headcount, $1.1 million in stock-based compensation expenses, $1.6 million in public company-related expenses and overhead and $2.5 million in consulting and professional service expenses, as we expanded our operations. We also recorded a $0.8 million non-cash one-time charge of collaboration acquisition costs in 2013 related to the issuance of 689,655 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to a potential collaborator for cash at a price per share below the fair value of such shares. We expect general and administrative costs to increase in future periods, reflecting both the increased costs in connection with the future commercialization of AVA-101 and our pipeline products, as well as an expanded infrastructure and increased professional fees associated with being a public company.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased to $18,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $73,000 for the comparable period in 2013 as outstanding convertible notes were converted into Series B convertible preferred stock in April 2014.\nChanges in Fair Value of Embedded Derivative\nWe recorded an embedded derivative liability in connection with our 2012 Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded income of $18,000 for the change in fair value of the embedded derivative liability. In November 2013, upon conversion of the 2012 Notes into Series A convertible preferred stock, the embedded derivative was reversed.\nChanges in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities\nWe recorded changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to ($92,000) for the year ended December 31, 2013. In connection with the completion of the IPO in August 2014, all of the then outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock were exercised. As a result of the exercises, we recorded a $0.8 million loss related to the change in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Related Party Convertible Notes\nIn April 2014, we converted the outstanding balance under our related-party convertible notes of $2.0 million into 295,115 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock at 90% of the purchase price paid by other investors, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $0.2 million in 2014.\nIn November 2013, we amended the terms of the convertible notes agreement to accelerate their conversion into shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, which we determined represented an extinguishment. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $1.7 million in 2013.\nDeemed Dividend\nIn April 2014, we repurchased 531,208 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock for $4.0 million. The difference between the repurchase price of $7.53 per share and original issuance price of $1.45 per share was recorded as a deemed dividend of $3.2 million to a preferred stockholder and effected the calculation of net loss attributable to common stockholders and net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Plan of Operations\nWe have not generated positive cash flow or net income from operations since our inception and at December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $84.2 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administration expenses. On January 13, 2015, we completed a Follow-on Offering and we received net proceeds of approximately $130.6 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2015, we had $221.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $37.7 million of marketable securities invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agencies securities with maturities of 12 months or less. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2015 will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future and, if the acquisition of Annapurna is consummated, sufficient to fund the combined company's operations for at least the next 36 months.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and ongoing internal research and development programs. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or aggregate amount of such costs. However, in order to complete our planned preclinical trials and any future clinical trials, and to complete the process of obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, as well as to build the sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure that we believe will be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, we will require substantial additional funding in the future.\nIf and when we seek additional funding, we will do so through equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or"}
