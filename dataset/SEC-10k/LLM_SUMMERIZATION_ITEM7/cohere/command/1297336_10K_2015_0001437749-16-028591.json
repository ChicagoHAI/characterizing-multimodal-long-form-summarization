Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion together with Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including those we describe in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Part I, Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nReachLocal's mission is to provide more customers to businesses. We began in 2004 with the goal of helping local businesses move their advertising spend from traditional media and yellow pages to online search. While we have sold to a variety of local businesses and will continue to do so, our present focus is on small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and in particular, what we refer to as Premium SMBs. A Premium SMB generally has 10 to 30 employees, $1 to $10 million in annual revenue and spends approximately $40,000 annually on marketing. Premium SMBs have become increasingly sophisticated in their understanding of online marketing. However, we believe that Premium SMBs have not changed their desire for a single, unified solution to their marketing needs. Our goal is to provide a total digital marketing solution that will address Premium SMBs' online marketing needs. Our total digital marketing solution consists of products and solutions in three categories: digital advertising (including ReachSearch\u2122, ReachRetargeting\u2122, ReachDisplay\u2122, and ReachDisplay InAppTM ), web presence (including ReachSEO\u2122, ReachCast\u2122, TotalLiveChat\u2122, ReachSite+ReachEdge\u2122) and software (ReachEdge\u2122 and Kickserv\u2122).\nWe began by offering online advertising solutions with the rollout of ReachSearch in 2005, when we pioneered the provisioning of search engine marketing services (SEM) on a mass scale for local businesses through the use of our technology platform. ReachSearch combines search engine marketing optimized across multiple publishers, call tracking and call recording services, and industry leading campaign performance transparency. ReachSearch remains a leading SEM offering for local businesses and has won numerous awards since its rollout, including most recently winning Google's Quality Score Champion Award in North America and Latin America. However, ReachSearch does not solve all of the online advertising challenges of our clients. We have therefore added additional elements to our platform including our display product, ReachDisplay and ReachDisplay InApp, our behavioral targeting product, ReachRetargeting, and other products that are primarily focused on leveraging third-party media to drive leads to our clients.\nTo complement our online digital advertising solutions, we have also launched a number of presence solutions. These solutions include websites, social, search engine optimization (SEO), chat and other products and solutions, all focused on expanding and leveraging our clients' web presence. Often these products are designed to work in concert with our digital advertising products with a goal of enhancing the return to our clients. These products are generally available in North America and selectively available in our international markets.\nWe also recognize that even successfully driving leads to our clients does not represent a complete solution to local businesses' online marketing needs. In 2013, we expanded into lead conversion software with the introduction of ReachEdge in order to move beyond being a media-driven lead generation business to offering integrated solutions for our clients. ReachEdge is marketing automation and lead conversion software and includes tools for capturing web traffic information and converting leads into new customers. Initially, ReachEdge only came bundled with a responsive website. However, beginning in the first quarter of 2015, clients have been able to license ReachEdge's lead conversion software without having to also purchase a website, allowing us to sell ReachEdge to local businesses who do not need a new website or who purchase their website from another provider.\nOver time, we plan to add additional dynamic optimization functionality to ReachEdge, as well as features that create a more seamless relationship between our clients and their customers. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we acquired Kickserv, a provider of cloud-based business management software for service businesses. With this addition, we now have the ability to provide an end-to-end solution to our clients that starts with lead generation (ReachSearch, ReachDisplay and ReachSEO), includes lead conversion software (ReachEdge), and then closes and manages the business relationship (Kickserv). Local businesses already spend marketing dollars in these categories with a significant number of providers in a highly fragmented and confusing marketplace. Our integrated total marketing solution seeks to address this broad array of business needs with a simple integrated solution.\nIn North America, we sell our products and solutions directly, principally through our outside sales force and in certain situations, an inside sales force, in what we refer to as our Direct Local channel. Our sales personnel (primarily referred to as Digital Marketing Consultants or DMCs) both generate the sale and manage the client relationship. Each DMC is paired with a Marketing Expert (or ME) who provides day-to-day campaign management. We believe that this approach enables the DMC to focus primarily on selling and managing client relationships, while the client benefits from the support and expertise of dedicated MEs. We also have certain veteran salespeople that we refer to as IMCs who have more discretion to manage their client relationships and campaigns. Our international markets generally operate under a modified version of the North American model, suited for local market and product availability differences.\nWe refer to our separate sales channel targeting national brands, franchises and strategic accounts with operations in multiple local markets, and select third-party agencies and resellers as our NBAR channel. The sales process for the NBAR channel typically has substantially longer lead times than in our Direct Local channel. In addition, national brand clients often involve complexity due to operational and marketing requirements that are not normally required by our Direct Local clients. Our third-party agencies and reseller partners use our technology platform in customer segments where they have sales forces with established relationships with their client bases. We currently have over 350 agencies and resellers actively selling on our technology platform. We have a team that is responsible for identifying potential agencies and resellers, training their sales forces to sell our products and services and supporting the relationships on an ongoing basis.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015 we introduced our Web Partner Program, under which we distribute ReachEdge through third-party web developers. We are focusing on potential partners that typically have client bases ranging from 200 to 2,000 clients. By distributing ReachEdge with their platforms, Web Partners can deliver value to their clients while also earning an additional revenue stream. We believe that our Web Partner Program can increase our sales force's productivity by giving our sales people easier access to potential new clients.\nIn addition to the United States and Canada, we have sales operations in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria Brazil and Mexico. We exited direct sales in the United Kingdom market in the fourth quarter of 2015 when our local subsidiary ReachLocal UK Ltd. ( RL UK\u201d) entered administration and we continue to review our international operations in order to rationalize operations in overseas markets we determine to be underperforming and to optimize operations in our primary markets.\nOperating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of financial and operating metrics to evaluate our business, determine the allocation of resources and make decisions regarding business strategies.\nThe following table shows certain key operating metrics for the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Active Clients (at period end) (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,900 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Active Product Units (at period end) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n(2)\n</td> <td> See Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\u201d for our definition of Active Clients.\nSee Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\u201d for our definition of Active Product Units.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nActive Clients and Active Product Units\nWe track the number of Active Clients and Active Product Units to evaluate the growth, scale and diversification of our business. We also use these metrics to determine the needs and capacity of our sales forces, our support organization and other personnel and resources. The decrease in the number of Active Clients and Active Product Units is primarily due to an overall decrease in salespeople in both the Direct Local and NBAR channel as we decreased the size of our sales force in an effort to focus on more productive salespeople, partially offset by the addition of Kickserv clients and increased client retention in the Direct Local channel. The productivity of our current sales force improved compared to the prior-year period, but not enough to offset the decrease in number of sales people. Our exit from direct sales in the U.K. in the fourth quarter of 2015 reduced our number of Active Clients and Active Product Units at year-end and will continue to have a negative effect on those metrics in the first quarter of 2016.\nBasis of Presentation\nSources of Revenue\nWe derive our revenue principally from the provision and sale of online marketing products to our clients. Revenue includes (i) the sale of our ReachSearch, ReachRetargeting, ReachDisplay, and other products based on a package pricing model in which our clients commit to a fixed fee that includes the media, optimization, reporting and tracking technologies of our technology platform, and the personnel dedicated to support and manage their campaigns; (ii) the license (or sale) of ReachEdge, ReachSEO, ReachCast, TotalLiveChat, TotalTrack, ReachSite, Kickserv and other products and solutions; and (iii) set-up, management and service fees associated with these products and other solutions. We distribute our products and solutions directly through our outside and inside sales force that is focused on serving local businesses in their local markets through a consultative process, which we refer to as our Direct Local channel, as well as a separate sales force targeting our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers channel. The sales cycle for sales to our clients ranges from one day to over a month. Sales to our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers clients generally require several months.\nWe typically enter into multi-month agreements for the delivery of our products. Under our agreements, our Direct Local clients typically pay, in advance, a fixed fee on a monthly basis, which includes all charges for the included technology and any media services, management, third-party content and other costs and fees. We record these prepayments as deferred revenue and only recognize revenue in our statement of operations as we purchase media and perform other services on behalf of clients. Certain Direct Local clients are extended credit privileges with payment generally due in 30 days. Revenue from the licensing of our products is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable license or service period. There were $4.0 million and $3.2 million of accounts receivable related to our Direct Local channel at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nOur National Brands, Agencies and Resellers clients enter into agreements of various lengths or that are indefinite. Our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers clients either pay in advance or are extended credit privileges with payment generally due in 30 to 60 days. There were $3.3 million and $5.0 million of accounts receivable related to our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of the costs of online media acquired from third-party publishers. Media cost is recorded as cost of revenue in the period in which the corresponding revenue is recognized. From time to time, publishers offer us rebates based upon various factors and operating rules, including the amount of media purchased. We record these rebates in the period in which they are earned as a reduction to cost of revenue and the corresponding payable to the applicable publisher, or as other receivable, as appropriate. Cost of revenue also includes the third-party telephone and information services costs, other third-party service provider costs, data center and third-party hosting costs, credit card processing fees, and other direct costs.\nIn addition, cost of revenue includes costs to manage and operate our various solutions and technology infrastructure, other than costs associated with our sales force, which are reflected as selling and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation for the related staff, including our MEs who manage client accounts and provide client-facing support, and allocated overhead such as depreciation expense, rent and utilities. Cost of revenue also includes the amortization and impairment charges (as applicable) on acquired technology, customer relationships and trade names.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our selling and marketing staff, including salaries and wages, commissions and other variable compensation, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; travel and business costs; training, recruitment, marketing and promotional events; advertising; other brand building and product marketing expenses; and occupancy, technology and other direct overhead costs. A portion of the compensation for employees in the sales organization is based on commissions. In addition, the cost of agency commissions is included in selling and marketing expenses. Generally, commissions are expensed as earned. However, we pay commissions to certain sales people for the acquisition of new clients and because our client contracts are generally not cancelable without a penalty, we defer those commissions and amortize them over the initial contract term.\nProduct and Technology. Product and technology expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our product development and engineering professionals, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, and the cost of third-party contractors and certain third-party service providers and other expenses, including occupancy, technology and other direct overhead costs. Technology operations costs, including related personnel and third-party costs, are included in product and technology expenses. We capitalize a portion of costs as software development and, accordingly, include amortization of those costs as product and technology expenses. Our technology platform addresses all aspects of our activities, including supporting the selling and consultation process, integrating with online publishers, driving efficiency and optimization, providing insight to our clients into the results and effects of their online advertising campaigns and supporting financial and other back-office functions of our business.\nProduct and technology expenses also include the amortization of the technology obtained in acquisitions and the expensing of acquisition-related deferred payment obligations attributable to product and technology personnel. Product and technology expenses do not include the costs to deliver our solutions to clients, which are included in cost of revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for board, executive, legal, finance, human resources and corporate communications, including wages, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, professional fees, insurance premiums, business taxes and other expenses, including occupancy, technology and other direct overhead, public company costs and other corporate expenses.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges consist of costs associated with the realignment and reorganization of our operations. Restructuring charges include employee termination costs, facility closure and relocation costs, contract termination costs and costs associated with utilizing a third party consultant to facilitate the execution of our 2015 restructuring plan. The timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and can extend over a 12-month period or longer. We record liabilities related to restructuring charges in accrued restructuring in the consolidated balance sheets. See further discussion in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill Impairment. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, due to a decline in internal projections for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit of both revenue and profitability as a result of recent declines its financial performance, we determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim quantitative goodwill assessment for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015. The amount of goodwill assigned to the Asia-Pacific reporting unit at August 31, 2015 was $34.1 million. Based on our revised forecasts, the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit. As a result, we recorded an estimated impairment charge of $27.8 million for the goodwill in the Asia-Pacific reporting unit during the third quarter of 2015, which was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2015 without further adjustment and is included in impairment of goodwill in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We did not identify an impairment of our finite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets based on our estimates included in the second step of the quantitative test.\nThe process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires us to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. The estimated fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015 was determined using both an income-based valuation approach, and a market-based valuation approach, each weighted 50%. Under the income approach, fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using the discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method is dependent upon a number of factors, including projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows, assumed discount rates determined to be commensurate with the risks inherent in our business model, and other assumptions. The future cash flows for the reporting unit was projected based on our estimates, at that time, of future revenues, operating income and other factors (such as working capital and capital expenditures). We took into account expected competitive global industry and market conditions. Under the market-based valuation approach, each reporting unit's fair value is estimated based on industry multiples of revenues and operating earnings.\nThe inputs of the discounted cash flow method used to determine the fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit included a conservative average 3% growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 17%. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in (i) number of clients and active campaigns, which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand, including macroeconomic factors, competitive dynamics and changes in consumer preferences; (ii) marketing costs to generate new campaigns; and (iii) equity valuations of peer companies.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs a result of the disposal of our ClubLocal business in exchange for a minority equity interest in December 2013, we have reclassified and presented all related historical financial information with respect to ClubLocal as discontinued operations\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In addition, we have excluded all ClubLocal related activities from the following discussions, unless specifically referenced.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements:\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Accounts receivable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Software development costs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Loan receivables\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-marketable investments\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Variable interest entities\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Goodwill\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Revenue recognition\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Restructuring charges\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Income taxes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts Receivable\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history, the customer's creditworthiness and various other factors, as determined by our review of their credit information. We monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any customer-specific collection issues that we have identified.\nSoftware Development Costs\nCosts to develop software for internal use are capitalized when we have determined that the development efforts will result in new or additional functionality or new products. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria and costs associated with ongoing maintenance are expensed as incurred and included in product and technology expenses, in addition to amortization of capitalized software development costs, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We monitor our existing capitalized software costs and reduce its carrying value as the result of releases that render previous features or functions obsolete. Software development costs are evaluated for impairment in accordance with our policy for finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Costs capitalized as internal use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three years.\nLoan Receivables\nWe record loan receivables at carrying value, net of potential allowance for losses. Losses on receivables are recorded when probable and estimable. Interest income on loan receivables is accrued on a monthly basis over the life of the loan, and interest recognition is suspended upon impairment of loan principal.\nNon-marketable Investments\nWe account for non-marketable investments under the cost method, which are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment. The fair value of a cost method investment is not evaluated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. However, if a significant adverse event were identified, we would estimate the fair value of its cost method investment considering available information at the time of the event, such as current cash position, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance and any other readily available data. If we determine that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the investment is written-down to its fair value.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe analyze our interests, including agreements, loans, guarantees, and equity investments, on a periodic basis to determine if such interests are variable interests. If variable interests are identified, then the related entity is assessed to determine if it is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d). Our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. We base our quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flows of the entity, and our qualitative analysis on the design of the entity, its organizational structure including its decision-making authority, and relevant agreements. If we determine that the entity is a VIE, we then assesses if we must consolidate the VIE as our primary beneficiary. Our determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is based upon qualitative and quantitative analyses, which assess the purpose and design of the VIE, the nature of the VIE's risks and the risks that we absorb, the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE.\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets are attributable to the various developed technologies, trade names, and customer relationships of the businesses we have acquired. We report finite-lived, acquisition-related intangible assets at acquisition date fair value, net of accumulated amortization. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years. Straight-line amortization is used as another pattern over which the economic benefits will be consumed cannot be reliably determined. We review the carrying values of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable. In our analysis of other finite-lived amortizable intangible assets, we apply the guidance of ASC 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, in determining whether any impairment conditions exist. An impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an intangible asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate, if it is determined that an asset is not recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset's fair value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no indications of impairment of our finite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquired businesses over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We account for goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill. ASC 350 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires us to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually.\nWe test the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the legal or business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key management or other personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the acquired business or our overall business, significant and sustained decline in market capitalization, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nTesting goodwill for impairment involves a two-step quantitative process. However, prior to performing the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether or not it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for selected reporting units. If we choose the qualitative option, we are not required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test unless we have determined, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair values of a reporting unit with its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, including goodwill, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, or if the reporting unit has a negative carrying value and we believe it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, then the second step is performed to compare the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value, which is determined by deducting the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nThe process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires us to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. The estimated fair value for each reporting unit is determined using both an income-based valuation approach, as well as a market-based valuation approach. Under the income approach, each reporting unit's fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method is dependent upon a number of factors, including projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows, assumed discount rates determined to be commensurate with the risks inherent in its business model, and other assumptions. Under the market-based valuation approach, each reporting unit's fair value is estimated based on industry multiples of revenues and operating earnings. The income-based approach is weighted between 50.0% and 66.7% depending on the amount and timing of projected operating earnings attributable to each reporting unit.\nWe operate in one reportable segment, in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, which is the basis that financial results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We have identified our reporting units as North America, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Europe. These reporting units each constitute a business or group of businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by each reporting unit's management. Our goodwill is comprised of balances in both the North America and Asia-Pacific reporting units.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2015, due to a decline in internal projections for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit of both revenue and profitability as a result of recent declines its financial performance, we determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim quantitative goodwill assessment for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015. The amount of goodwill assigned to the Asia-Pacific reporting unit at August 31, 2015 was $34.1 million. Based on our revised forecasts, the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit. As a result, we recorded an estimated impairment charge of $27.8 million for the goodwill in the Asia-Pacific reporting unit during the third quarter of 2015, which was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2015 without further adjustment and is included in impairment of goodwill in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We did not identify an impairment of our finite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets based on our estimates included in the second step of the quantitative test.\nThe process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires us to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. The estimated fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015 was determined using both an income-based valuation approach, and a market-based valuation approach, each weighted 50%. Under the income approach, fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using the discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method is dependent upon a number of factors, including projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows, assumed discount rates determined to be commensurate with the risks inherent in our business model, and other assumptions. The future cash flows for the reporting unit was projected based on our estimates, at that time, of future revenues, operating income and other factors (such as working capital and capital expenditures). We took into account expected competitive global industry and market conditions. Under the market-based valuation approach, each reporting unit's fair value is estimated based on industry multiples of revenues and operating earnings.\nThe inputs of the discounted cash flow method used to determine the fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit included a conservative average 3% growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 17%. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in (i) number of clients and active campaigns, which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand, including macroeconomic factors, competitive dynamics and changes in consumer preferences; (ii) marketing costs to generate new campaigns; and (iii) equity valuations of peer companies.\nAs of October 1, 2015, the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we considered our recent interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, which included a reconciliation of our total market capitalization based on the estimated fair value of our individual reporting units as of August 31, 2015. We qualitatively determined that then existing facts and circumstances were considered in our quantitative interim impairment test, such that it was not necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for our North America and Asia Pacific reporting units as of the annual testing date.\nAs of November 30, 2015, due to the then recent significant declines in our market capitalization and other changes in the business, including consideration of exiting the U.K. market, and the entrance of RL UK into administration, we determined that sufficient indicators existed to perform an interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment of our North America and Asia Pacific reporting units.\nThe first step of the November 30, 2015 quantitative goodwill impairment test resulted in the determination that the estimated fair value of both our North American reporting unit and our Asia Pacific reporting unit each substantially exceeded its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. Accordingly, the second step was not required. The inputs for the fair value calculations of the North America reporting unit included a conservative 2% growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 18%. The inputs for the fair value calculations of the Asia Pacific reporting unit included a conservative 2% growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 20.5%. In addition, we assumed revenue growth and applied margin and other cost assumptions consistent with each reporting unit's historical trends. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in (i) number of clients and active campaigns, which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand, including macroeconomic factors, competitive dynamics and changes in consumer preferences; (ii) marketing costs to generate new campaigns; and (iii) equity valuations of peer companies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue for our products and solutions when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been performed, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue for search engine marketing as clicks are recorded on sponsored links on the various search engines and for our display advertising and retargeting when the display advertisements record impressions or as otherwise provided in our agreement with the applicable publisher. We recognize revenue for lead conversion software, web presence and other products with a defined license or service period on a straight line basis over the applicable license or service period. We recognize revenue when we charge set-up, management service or other fees on a straight line basis over the term of the related contract or the completion of any obligation for services, if shorter. We account for sales and similar taxes imposed on our services on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWhen we receive advance payments from clients, we record these amounts as deferred revenue until the revenue is recognized. From time to time, we offer incentives to clients in exchange for minimum commitments. In these circumstances, we estimate the amount of the incentives that will be earned by clients and adjust the recognition of revenue to reflect such incentives. Estimates are either based upon a statistical analysis of previous campaigns for which such incentives were offered, or calculated on a straight-line basis over the life of the campaign.\nWhen we sell through agencies, we either receive payment in advance of the delivery of our products or solutions or in some cases extend credit. We pay each agency an agreed-upon commission based on the revenue we earn or cash we receive. Some agency clients that have been extended credit may offset the amount otherwise due to us by any commissions they have earned. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of campaign revenue or the net amount earned after commissions. As we are generally the primary party obligated in the arrangement, subject to the credit risk, with discretion over both price and media, we typically recognize the gross amount of such sales as revenue and any commissions are recognized as a selling and marketing expense.\nWe also have a small number of resellers. Resellers integrate our products and solutions, including branded search engine marketing, display advertising and online marketing analytics, into their product offerings. In most cases, the resellers integrate with our technology platform through a custom Application Programming Interface (API). Resellers are responsible for the price and specifications of the integrated product offered to their clients. Resellers pay us in arrears, net of commissions and other adjustments. We recognize revenue generated under reseller agreements net of the agreed-upon commissions and other adjustments earned or retained by the reseller, as we believe that the reseller has retained sufficient control and bears sufficient risks to be considered the primary obligor in those arrangements.\nRestructuring Charges\nWe record costs associated with exit activities related to restructuring plans in accordance with the ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Obligations. Liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred. Restructuring charges consist of costs associated with the realignment and reorganization of our operations. Restructuring charges include employee termination costs, facility closure and relocation costs, and contract termination costs. The timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and can extend over a 12-month period. We record restructuring charge liabilities in accrued restructuring in the consolidated balance sheet.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation based on the fair market value of the equity award on the date of grant. We follow the attribution method, which reduces current stock-based compensation expenses recorded by the effect of anticipated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based upon our historical experience.\nThe fair value of each award is estimated on the date of the grant and amortized over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant. Determining the fair value of stock option awards at the grant date under this model requires judgment, including estimating volatility, expected term and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. In addition, we use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of market-based performance-vesting restricted stock and restricted stock units. Determining the fair value of these awards at the grant date under this model requires judgment, including estimating volatility, risk-free rate and expected future stock price. We determine the probability of achievement of performance milestones for non-market based performance vesting restricted stock and restricted stock units, and recognize expense based on the fair value of the award if it is probable that the performance milestone will be achieved. The assumptions described above rely on management estimates based on judgment and subjective future expectations, which may result in stock-based compensation for future awards that differs significantly from the awards granted previously.\nThe fair value of modifications to stock-based awards is generally estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. If a stock-based compensation award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation expense is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. Incremental compensation expense for fully vested awards is recognized immediately. For unvested awards, the sum of the incremental compensation expense and the remaining unrecognized compensation expense for the original award on the modification date is recognized over the modified service period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes and evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities.\nFor the periods presented, income tax expense represents income taxes imposed by federal, state, foreign and local tax jurisdictions applicable to our activities. We are also generating net operating losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe that it is likely that taxes imposed by state, local and foreign jurisdictions will increase in magnitude, particularly to the extent we become profitable in certain jurisdictions before the time we obtain profitability on a consolidated basis.\nWe evaluate deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is required. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on the generation of future taxable income. Due to our recent history of cumulative losses, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, excluding indefinite lived assets in U.S. jurisdictions. We continue to monitor the valuation allowance at each reporting period, and at this time, it is uncertain when such a release will occur.\nThe value of our investments in foreign subsidiaries exceeds our tax basis in those subsidiaries by $1.0 million. However, we have not recognized deferred income taxes on the associated gain because the gain only becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from the subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of the subsidiary and these amounts are expected to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the U.S.\nWe are required to file income tax returns in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are, and from time to time, have been subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, which may disagree with our tax positions. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.\nResults of

For example, if we were performing both ReachSearch and ReachDisplay campaigns for a client that also licenses ReachEdge, we consider that three Active Product Units. Similarly, if a client purchases ReachSearch campaigns for two different products or purposes, we consider that two Active Product Units. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNorth American revenue decreased by $43.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014. North America Direct Local revenue declined $27.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to smaller client bases entering the period and fewer new client acquisitions during the period due to a more difficult selling environment and fewer salespeople as we decreased the size of our salesforce in an effort to focus on more productive salespeople, partially offset by improvements in client retention. The average productivity of our current sales force improved compared to the prior-year period, but did not improve enough to offset client cancellations and fewer salespeople. North America National Brands, Agencies and Resellers revenue decreased by $16.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in client acquisitions and a decrease in client budgets in both the National Brands and Agencies and Resellers channels due to losses of key partners in both channels.\nInternational revenue decreased by $48.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014. International revenue was negatively impacted by foreign currency translations of $24.1 million due to the substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, particularly the euro and Australian dollar. International Direct Local decreased by $24.8 million, on a constant currency basis compared to the prior-year period, due to smaller client bases entering the periods and fewer new client acquisitions during the periods due to a more difficult selling environment and fewer salespeople as we contracted our salesforce during the ongoing transition to our new sales model, partially offset by an improvement in client retention. The decrease in 2015, was partially offset by an increase of $1.6 million of revenue from former SureFire clients being reported in the Direct Local channel rather than the National Brands, Agencies and Resellers channel as in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of the SureFire revenue, the International National Brands, Agencies and Resellers revenue remained relatively flat on a constant currency basis compared to 2014. International revenue related to our U.K. market, which we exited in 2015, was $25.2 million and $36.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDirect Local revenue decreased by $37.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a 19.3% decline of North American Direct Local revenue compared to the prior year period as a result of decreased new customer acquisitions due to lower sales productivity, lower customer retention and fewer salespeople selling our products during 2014, each of which we believe are primarily attributable to the realignment of our North American Direct Local sales force. Since the realignment of our North American sales force in late 2013, we experienced high attrition in our North American sales force, which negatively impacted client acquisition and retention. The decline in our North American Direct Local revenue was partially offset by growth in our international markets. We experienced this growth notwithstanding negative impact from the substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, particularly the Australian dollar.\nDirect Local and National Brands, Agencies and Resellers revenue were both impacted as SureFire-related revenue that was reported as part of our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers channel prior to our acquisition of SureFire is now reported as part of our Direct Local channel. As a result, $6.4 million of SureFire revenue is included in Direct Local for 2014 instead of National Brands, Agencies and Resellers.\nThe decrease in National Brands, Agencies and Resellers revenue of $1.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to reporting revenue from Surefire clients in the Direct Local channel rather than in National Brands, Agencies and Resellers. Revenue from SureFire included in National Brands, Agencies and Resellers for 2014 was $1.3 million as compared to $5.0 million in the prior-year period.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015-2014\n% Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014-2013\n% Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>252,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.6 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5 </td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.9 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to transfers of certain personnel to service and support functions (MEs) costing approximately $5.0 million that were previously included in sales and marketing, and an increase in service costs primarily related to our non-media products.\nPublisher rebates as a percentage of revenue decreased to 1.7% of revenue in 2015 from 2.5% in 2014. In addition, 2015 publisher rebates included 0.5% better than normal benefits attributable to the impact of regional and product mix, foreign exchange and program structure, which we do not expect to reoccur. On June 27, 2014, we entered into a new global agreement with Google Inc. and certain of its affiliates (the 2014 Google Agreement\u201d) that replaced our expiring Google agreement. The 2014 Google agreement provided rebates based on overall global growth of our spending with Google, as opposed to commitments to enter new markets and market-specific growth targets. On December 8, 2015, we amended the terms of the 2014 Google Agreement to replace the growth of spending targets with tiered aggregate global spending targets.\nThe increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in publisher rebates from 4.2% in 2013 to 2.5% in 2014, an increase in service, support, and third party costs primarily related to the launch of our ReachEdge and ReachSEO products, and increased costs to improve the performance of certain of our products.\nOur gross margins will be affected in the future by the availability and amount of publisher rebates, the costs of support and delivery, the mix and relative amount of media we purchase to fulfill service requirements, and the cost of third-party service providers that we use as part of our solutions. We expect publisher rebates as a percentage of revenue to be between 0.5% and 1.0% during 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and Marketing\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015-2014\n% Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014-2013\n% Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries, benefits and other costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>142,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.8 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commission expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.4 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22.7 </td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total selling and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30.5 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percentage of revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries, benefits and other costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.4 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commission expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total selling and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.5 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decreases in selling and marketing salaries, benefits and other costs in absolute dollars in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to fewer salespeople and non-sales personnel, and related cost reductions, including transfers of certain personnel to service and support functions (MEs) and reported in cost of revenue as a result of our transition to our DMC sales model. The decreases as a percentage of revenue were also due to increased revenue per-salesperson as we decreased the number of salespeople to focus on higher performing salespeople and consolidate client accounts.\nThe increases in commission expense as a percentage of revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by a shift in the revenue mix as a higher percentage of revenue was derived from channels which pay a higher commission rate and a lower percentage of revenue derived from channels which pay a lower commission rate.\nThe increase in selling and marketing salaries, benefits and other costs as a percentage of revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to the decrease in revenue and increases in salaries and fixed costs as a result of partially replacing residual commissions with base compensation for most of our North American sales personnel under the 2013 realignment of that sales force. The increase in selling and marketing salaries, benefits and other costs in absolute dollars was primarily a result of the shift to base compensation from residual commissions.\nThe decrease in commission expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to a decrease in sales activity and a change in compensation structure in North America in connection with the North American sales force realignment. Commission expense also decreased due to a higher percentage of revenue from our international Direct Local channel, for which we have historically paid lower commission rates.\nProduct and Technology\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015-2014\n% Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014-2013\n% Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product and technology expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.7 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized software development costs from product and technology resources\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.3 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total product and technology costs expensed and capitalized\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.2 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percentage of revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product and technology expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized software development costs from product and technology resources\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total product and technology costs expensed and capitalized\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct and technology expenses increased in absolute dollars in 2015 compared to 2014, while total product and technology expenses and capitalized costs decreased during the period. Employee and professional services costs decreased by $5.7 million during 2015 due to our cost savings initiatives, but were more than offset by increased amortization of software development costs of $2.1 million and a decrease in the amount of total product and technology costs expensed and capitalized during the period of $3.4 million due to the timing of achieving certain project development milestones. The increase in total product and technology costs expensed and capitalized as a percentage of revenue were primarily driven by the decrease in revenue.\nThe increases in product and technology expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 were primarily attributable to increased third-party development costs of $4.0 million and increased salaries and compensation expense of $2.2 million, each as part of the ongoing development of our technology platform and new product initiatives, and increased expense related to the commencement of amortization of previously capitalized software development costs and acquired intangibles of $0.9 million. The increases were partially offset by $2.0 million of increased capitalization due to an increase in capitalizable projects, including those relating to our new product initiatives. The increases in product and technology expenses as a percentage of revenue were also a result of decreased revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015-2014\n% Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014-2013\n% Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.6 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decreases in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 were primarily due to decreases of $5.1 million for employee costs and $3.2 million for stock based compensation, each due to workforce reductions as a result of our cost management activities, and a decrease of $0.7 million in professional services costs. In addition, 2014 included $1.5 million for bad debt expense related to our United Kingdom market, which did not occur in 2015.\nThe increases in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 were primarily due to a $3.5 million increase in employee-related costs largely as a result of increased salaries and payroll costs, $3.6 million of professional fees, which consist of tax, consulting, audit and legal fees, primarily as a result of increased legal fees and contingencies in the U.K., and a $1.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of extending, on March 27, 2014, the time to exercise from seven to ten years for certain options granted during 2008 and 2009 with a strike price of $10.91. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense as compared to 2013 when we impaired $3.9 million due from OxataSMB. The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was also a result of decreased revenue.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn January 2015, we commenced our 2015 Restructuring Plan as part of our ongoing efforts to reduce expenses and improve the operating performance of our business. The initiative is focused on enhancing earnings through an analysis of opportunities to both improve revenue performance and reduce costs. Restructuring charges in 2015 totaled $7.5 million, consisting of $3.6 million in costs associated with utilizing a third party consultant to facilitate the execution of the plan, $2.3 million in contract termination costs, $1.1 million of lease termination costs as a result of down-sizing a North American facility, and $0.5 million in other associated costs. We expect to have continued restructuring activity under this plan for at least the next 12 months.\nDuring the first and second quarters of 2014, we also implemented restructuring plans to streamline operations and increase profitability. There has been no additional restructuring activity recognized within these 2014 plans in 2015, other than settlement of associated liabilities.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2015, due to a decline in internal projections for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit of both revenue and profitability as a result of recent declines its financial performance, we determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim quantitative goodwill assessment for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015. The amount of goodwill assigned to the Asia-Pacific reporting unit at August 31, 2015 was $34.1 million. Based on our revised forecasts, the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit. As a result, we recorded an estimated impairment charge of $27.8 million for the goodwill in the Asia-Pacific reporting unit during the third quarter of 2015, which was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2015 without further adjustment and is included in impairment of goodwill in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nGain on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary, Net\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a gain of $2.9 million related to the deconsolidation of RL U.K. upon its entrance into administration in connection with our plan to exit from the U.K. market. The gain is principally due to relief of accrued liabilities and reversal of the previously recorded cumulative translation adjustments that were previously reflected in operating income and loss. See further discussion in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $2.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014 as we began paying interest under a Loan and Security Agreement (the Hercules Loan Agreement\u201d) entered into on April 30, 2015.\nInterest expense remained relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther expense, net of $0.3 million in 2015 primarily consisted of foreign currency fluctuations affecting our cash balances, offset by interest income resulting from invested balances.\nOther income, net of $1.0 million in 2014 primarily consisted of interest income from invested balances of $0.6 million, the revaluation of the contingent consideration for SureFire of $0.3 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was (0.6) %, (1.0) % and 54.8%, respectively. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.4 million in 2015, compared to $0.5 million in 2014 and $3.7 million in 2013.\nThe income tax provisions for 2015, 2014 and 2013 relate primarily to U.S. Federal and State taxes as well as certain foreign income taxes. The overall decrease in tax expense in 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to the tax benefits associated with current period losses in U.S. jurisdictions, offset by the recording of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, excluding indefinite-lived assets in the U.S.\nGain (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nIn the fourth quarter of 2013, our Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of our ClubLocal business, and on February 18, 2014, we completed the contribution of our ClubLocal business to a new entity in exchange for a minority interest in the entity. This business has been accounted for as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our GAAP results discussed above, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our Adjusted EBITDA was as follows:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(60,870 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(46,112 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,164 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,096 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,505 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition and integration costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring charges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,410 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,801 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding, when applicable, stock-based compensation, the effects of accounting for business combinations (including any impairment of acquired intangibles and, in the case of the acquisition of SMB:LIVE, the deferred cash consideration), restructuring charges, and other non-operating income or expense. Adjusted EBITDA reflects the reclassification of discontinued operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA because (i) it is a key basis upon which our management assesses our operating performance; (ii) it may be a factor in the evaluation of the performance of our management in determining compensation; (iii) we use it, in conjunction with GAAP measures such as revenue and income (loss) from operations, for operational decision-making purposes; and (iv) we believe it is one of the primary metrics investors use in evaluating Internet marketing companies.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA permits an assessment of our operating performance, in addition to our performance based on our GAAP results that is useful in assessing the progress of the business. By excluding (i) the effects of accounting for business combinations and associated acquisition and integration costs, which obscure the measurable performance of the business operations; (ii) restructuring charges, which we do not consider reflective of our ongoing operating performance; (iii) depreciation and amortization and other non-operating income and expense, each of which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance; and (iv) stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, we believe that we are able to gain a fuller view of the operating performance of the business. We provide information relating to our Adjusted EBITDA so that investors have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations. We believe that trends in our Adjusted EBITDA are a valuable indicator of operating performance on a consolidated basis and of our ability to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures and investments in our sales force.\nIn addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies and other interested parties in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt-service capabilities. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing equity-based compensation to our management team and employees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income and expense items that relate to our financing and investing activities, any of which could significantly affect our results of operations or be a significant use of cash;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other companies, including companies in our industry, calculate Adjusted EBITDA measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace operating income (loss), net income (loss) and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of operating performance that you may consider in addition to those measures. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results, including cash flows provided by operating activities, and using total Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental financial measure.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (20,038\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities, continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,770\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (35,298\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,849\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities, continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,877\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,097\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used by discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (45\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (915\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,181\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2015, we used $20.0 million of net cash in operating activities from continuing operations, primarily due to a loss of $61.5 million from continuing operations and a change in operating assets and liabilities of $20.5 million, partially offset by non-cash expenses of $62.0 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease in accounts payable of $9.2 million due to the timing of payments, a decrease in deferred revenue of $4.5 million due to a decrease in sales, and a decrease in accrued restructuring of $6.5 million. Non-cash expenses included $27.8 million of goodwill impairment, $19.7 million of depreciation and amortization, $8.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $7.5 million of restructuring charges, offset in part by a gain of $2.9 million on deconsolidation of our U.K subsidiary due to exiting the market.\nNet cash used in operating activities related to continuing operations increased by $18.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of lower operating performance, offset by a reduction in expenses. Cash flow from operating activities was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in accounts payable of $18.3 million compared to 2014 due to the timing of payments and a decrease in accrued restructuring of $3.9 million. These unfavorable impacts to cash flow were partially offset by a decrease of income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash items of $7.4 million primarily due to reduction in operating expenses and a gain of $2.9 million on deconsolidation of our U.K subsidiary due to exiting the market.\nNet cash used in operating activities related to continuing operations increased by $32.1 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of lower operating performance. Income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash items decreased by $37.5 million. In addition, cash flow from operating activities was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits of $3.8 million compared to 2013 due to lower accruals for commissions and severance, a decrease in deferred revenue of $3.1 million compared to 2013 due to decreased sales, and restructuring payments of $2.6 million that did not occur in 2013. These unfavorable impacts to cash flow were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $6.2 million due to a change in timing of payment to vendors, a decrease in accounts receivable of $5.9 million compared to 2013 due to decreased sales, and an increase in deferred rent and other liabilities of $1.9 million compared to 2013 due to increased rent on operating leases and increased sales tax payables related to our international markets.\nInvesting Activities\nOur primary investing activities have consisted of capitalized software development costs, purchases of property and equipment, business acquisitions, investments in a partnership, and short-term investments. Each of these activities varies from period to period due to the timing of the expansion of our operations and our software development efforts.\nWe invested $13.8 million during 2015, which was a decrease of $21.5 million compared to 2014. The decrease primarily relates to decreases in purchases of property and equipment of $8.6 million and software development costs of $3.2 million as we constrained investment as part of our cost savings initiatives. In addition, in 2014 we made investments that were not matched in 2015, including $5.3 million to acquire Kickserv, an investment of $2.0 million in a privately held partnership and an investment of $1.5 million as part of the SureFire acquisition.\nWe invested $35.3 million in 2014, which was an increase of $11.4 million compared to 2013. Our purchases of property and equipment increased by $3.8 million and cash outflow from capitalization of software increased by $2.1 million in 2014 compared to 2013. We made a number of strategic investments totaling $9.1 million, including $5.3 million to acquire Kickserv, $1.5 million as part of the SureFire acquisition, and made an additional $2.0 million in a privately held partnership.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had significant internal product and technology resources working on projects that met the criteria for capitalization as software development costs and others that did not, although none of the projects in process was a long-term project (greater than one year). The amount capitalized for such projects in future periods will be evaluated by management and will impact the portion of costs for those internal resources that are included in cash used in investing activities. At December 31, 2015, we also had significant deferred revenue arising from prepayment by the great majority of our clients and vendor trade financing, principally for media. If our revenue continues to decline, we would expect our deferred revenue to decrease.\nWe expect to continue to reduce our use of capital for acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment, and development of software consistent with our cost savings initiatives.\nFinancing Activities\nOur primary financing activities have consisted of borrowing under a term loan and convertible notes, net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and capital lease obligations.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $6.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014, due to $24.7 million of net proceeds from the term loan entered into during April 2015, offset by segregation of $15.0 million of the term loan proceeds as restricted cash, and $5.0 million of proceeds from convertible notes issued to a related party. The increase was offset by a decrease in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $6.4 million. In addition, during 2015, we made a final payment totaling $0.5 million for the earn-out and indemnity holdback related to the acquisition of SureFire.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $17.2 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the absence of share repurchases in 2014.\nHercules Loan Agreement\nOn April 30, 2015, we entered into the Hercules Loan Agreement with our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, as co-borrowers, Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d), as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time (the Lenders\u201d), including Hercules, pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to make a term loan available to us for working capital and general business purposes, in a principal amount of $25.0 million. The term loan has an annual interest rate equal to the greater of (i) 11.75% and (ii) the sum of (a) the prime rate, plus (b) 8.50%. During December 2015, the annual interest rate increased from 11.75% to 12.00%. The annual interest rate on the Hercules Loan was 12.00% at December 31, 2015. On the closing date we paid a fee of $0.3 million, which is to be credited against the final payment, and debt issuance costs of $0.2 million.\nWe are required to make interest-only payments on the term loan through May 1, 2016, though such payments may be extended through August 1, 2016 and November 1, 2016 if we remain in continuous compliance with the financial covenants under the Hercules Loan Agreement through April 1, 2016 and July 1, 2016, respectively, and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing on such dates. The term loan will begin amortizing at the end of the applicable interest-only period, with monthly payments of principal and interest to the Lenders in consecutive monthly installments following the end of such interest-only period. The term loan matures on April 1, 2018 or, if the interest-only payments are extended through November 1, 2016, the term loan will mature October 1, 2018. Upon repayment of the term loan, we are also required to make an end-of-term payment to the Lenders equal to $1.5 million, which is accrued as interest based on the effective interest method over the 3-year term of the Hercules Loan Agreement. The term loan is secured by substantially all of our personal property, including our intellectual property.\nAt our option, the outstanding principal balance of the term loan may be prepaid in whole, or in part in a minimum amount of $2.5 million, subject to a prepayment fee of 3% of any amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs on or prior to April 30, 2016, or 2% of the amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs after April 30, 2016 but on or prior to April 30, 2017. If the prepayment occurs after April 30, 2017, there is no prepayment fee.\nThe Hercules Loan Agreement includes covenants applicable to us, which include restrictions on transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, selling assets, and undergoing a change in control, in each case subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions also include a maximum net new investment in our foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exclusions of $8.0 million during 2015, $5.5 million during 2016, $4.0 million annually thereafter, and $18.0 million in the aggregate during the term of the agreement. Additionally, the Hercules Loan Agreement includes financial covenant requirements to maintain certain minimum levels of revenue and earnings during each three-month period, tested monthly, during the term, as amended on August 3, 2015 from September 30, 2015 through December 31, 2015. These minimum levels of revenue and earnings were waived for compliance for November and December 2015 as amended on November 9, 2015. Under the Hercules Loan Agreement, we are required to maintain minimum cash in North America in an amount equal to $15.0 million at all times, as amended on December 17, 2015, unless we achieve positive Adjusted EBITDA\u201d as defined, for three consecutive quarters, in which case the minimum cash and cash equivalent balance decreases to $12.5 million. We achieved positive Adjusted EBITDA\u201d as defined, during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, which qualifies as two quarters of the required three consecutive quarters. The Hercules Loan Agreement also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which provide Hercules, as administrative agent, with the right to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the term loan, including potential foreclosure against our assets securing the Hercules Loan Agreement, including our cash. The Hercules Loan Agreement also contains a subjective acceleration clause that can be triggered if we experience a Material Adverse Effect, as defined in the Hercules Loan Agreement, which would be considered an event of default.\nOn August 3, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Hercules Loan Agreement, which reduced the term loan's covenant thresholds for revenue for the months ending September 30, 2015 through December 31, 2015. On November 9, 2015, we entered into a second amendment to the Hercules Loan Agreement with Hercules, which waives compliance with the term loan's revenue and earnings covenant thresholds for November and December 2015. In connection with the amendment, we (i) paid Hercules a one-time fee of $0.2 million, (ii) reset the schedule of prepayment fees to begin from November 9, 2015, instead of April 30, 2016, and (iii) agreed to amend the Hercules warrant as described below. On December 17, 2015, we entered into the third amendment to the Hercules Loan Agreement, which reduces the amount of restricted cash we are required to maintain in North America from $17.5 million to $15.0 million and which amount will further be reduced to $12.5 million if we achieve positive Adjusted EBITDA\u201d as defined in the loan agreement. We are in compliance with all of the Hercules Loan Agreement's covenants as of December 31, 2015.\nConcurrently with entrance into the Hercules Loan Agreement, we issued to Hercules, as the sole lender on the closing date, a warrant to purchase up to 177,304 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $2.82 per share. In connection with the November 9, 2015 Hercules Loan Agreement amendment, we agreed to amend the warrant to increase the number of shares to 300,000 and reduce the exercise price to $0.85. The warrant is exercisable in full and not in part. In addition, if upon the sale of all shares issued upon exercise of the warrant, or in the case of a merger or sale transaction involving other securities in whole or in part, upon the sale of such securities, the absolute return on the warrant exceeds $2.55 per share underlying the warrant, the warrant holder will pay us the excess in cash. The warrant may be exercised either for cash or on a cashless basis. The warrant expires April 30, 2022. We estimated the fair value of the warrant to be $0.3 million based on its relative fair value to the term loan using a Black-Sholes pricing model and accounted for the warrant as a discount on the carrying amount of the term loan and a component of additional paid-in capital. The fair value of the warrant will be amortized in the statement of operations as a component of interest expense.\nVantagePoint Convertible Notes (Related Party)\nOn December 17, 2015, we entered into a convertible note purchase agreement with affiliates of our largest shareholder, VantagePoint Capital Partners ( VantagePoint\u201d), for the immediate issuance of $5.0 million of Convertible Second Lien Subordinated Notes (the VantagePoint Notes\u201d). The note purchase agreement also provides for the issuance and sale of up to an additional $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes, upon mutual agreement of ReachLocal and VantagePoint (and Hercules' consent). The notes bear an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded quarterly. We are required to begin making quarterly interest and principal payments on April 15, 2017, subject to a subordination agreement with Hercules. The VantagePoint Notes mature on April 15, 2018, and remaining principal payments and unpaid interest is due at that time. The holders of the VantagePoint Notes have the right to convert any portion of the VantagePoint Notes into shares of ReachLocal common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, at an initial conversion rate of 200 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of VantagePoint Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of $5.00 per share. The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments for stock dividends, splits and combinations, certain distributions on the common stock, including cash dividends, spin-offs and certain tender or exchange offers for the common stock. An event of default, as defined in the agreement, may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the notes. The VantagePoint Notes are included in convertible notes - related party in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nOn February 4, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the VantagePoint Notes. The amendment provides that, except in certain circumstances, the convertibility of the VantagePoint Notes is limited such that conversion may not result in the holders collectively acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 1.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock during any 12-month period.\nVantagePoint and its affiliates beneficially own approximately 43% of our common stock and VantagePoint's Chief Executive Officer and Managing Partner, is a member of our Board of Directors.\nThe agreement governing the notes and the term loan contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the term loan to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable.\nLiquidity\nDuring 2015, we experienced declining revenues as a result of challenging market conditions and worse than expected performance in our international markets. These conditions, combined with our initiatives to transform the business and focus on profitable revenue, have had a significant negative impact on our operating results and cash flows. As a result, we have taken a number of steps to reduce expenses and improve our results of operations through, for example, our 2015 Restructuring Plan, including cost-saving measures, such as workforce reductions, downsizing certain facilities in North America, as well as reductions of general corporate expenses and capital expenditures.\nIn order to provide additional liquidity to meet working capital and capital resource requirements, on April 30, 2015, we entered into the Hercules Loan Agreement for a $25.0 million term loan. We received $24.7 million of net proceeds from the term loan, $15.0 million of which is considered restricted cash required under the terms of the Hercules Loan Agreement. In addition, on December 17, 2015, we entered into a convertible note purchase agreement with affiliates of its largest shareholder for the immediate issuance of $5.0 million of the VantagePoint Notes. The note purchase agreement also provides for the issuance and sale of up to an additional $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes, upon mutual agreement of ReachLocal and VantagePoint (and Hercules' consent). We are required to make interest-only payments on the Hercules term loan through May 1, 2016, though such payments may be extended through August 1, 2016 and November 1, 2016 if we remain in continuous compliance with the financial covenants under the Hercules Loan Agreement through April 1, 2016 and July 1, 2016, respectively, and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing on such dates. Upon repayment of the term loan, we are also required to make an end-of-term payment to the Lenders equal to $1.5 million, which is accrued as interest based on the effective interest method over the 3-year term of the Hercules Loan Agreement. The term loan is secured by substantially all of our personal property, including our intellectual property. We are required to begin making quarterly interest and principal payments on the VantagePoint Notes on April 15, 2017, subject to a subordination agreement with Hercules.\nThe Hercules Loan Agreement includes covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, which include restrictions on transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness, creating liens, selling assets, and undergoing a change in control, in each case subject to certain exceptions, as well as financial covenant requirements to maintain certain minimum levels of revenue and earnings during each three-month period, tested monthly, during the term. These restrictions also include a maximum net new investment in our foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exclusions of $8.0 million during 2015, $5.5 million during 2016, $4.0 million annually thereafter, and $18.0 million in the aggregate during the term of the agreement. The Hercules Loan Agreement also contains a subjective acceleration clause that can be triggered if we experience a Material Adverse Effect, as defined in the Hercules Loan Agreement, which would be considered an event of default. On August 3, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Hercules Loan Agreement, which reduced the Hercules Loan Agreement's covenant thresholds for revenue for the months ending September 30, 2015 through December 31, 2015. On November 9, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Hercules Loan Agreement, which waived compliance with the revenue and earnings covenant thresholds for November and December 2015. In connection with the amendment, we (i) paid Hercules a one-time fee of $0.2 million, (ii) reset the schedule of prepayment fees to begin from November 9, 2015, instead of April 30, 2016, and (iii) agreed to amend the Hercules Warrant. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the Hercules Loan Agreement.\nOur operating losses and capital expenditures more than offset the $15.0 million of net unrestricted cash from the Hercules Loan Agreement and VantagePoint Notes, resulting in cash and cash equivalents of $18.8 million and short-term investments of $0.4 million at December 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Short term investments consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities in excess of three months but less than 12 months. To date, we have experienced no loss of our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments, although some of those balances are subject to foreign currency exchange risk (see Item 3, Foreign Currency Exchange Risk,\u201d for more information). We cannot, however, provide any assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. At December 31, 2015, we had restricted cash in North America related to the minimum cash balance required to be maintained under the terms of the Hercules Loan Agreement of $15.0 million. If we achieve positive Adjusted EBITDA\u201d as defined in the Loan Agreement, for three consecutive quarters, the minimum cash balance decreases to $12.5 million. We achieved positive Adjusted EBITDA\u201d as defined during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, which qualifies as two quarters of the required three consecutive quarters. Also, at December 31, 2015, we had restricted cash related to certificates of deposits held at financial institutions that are pledged as collateral for letters of credit related to lease commitments, collateral for merchant accounts, and cash deposits funded to a restricted account determined on a monthly basis in accordance with our employee health care self-insurance plan in the amount of $3.5 million, of which, $0.2 million relate to the employee health care self-insurance plan. Our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by $60.6 million at December 31, 2015, and we incurred an operating loss of $61.5 million for the year then ended.\nWe believe that we will be able to maintain compliance with the minimum cash balance in North America in excess of $15.0 million through March 31, 2016, and subsequently maintain a minimum cash balance in North America of $12.5 million in accordance with achievement of positive Adjusted EBITDA\u201d as defined above. We also believe that we will extend our interest-only payments through November 1, 2016 by maintaining continuous compliance and not experiencing a default or event of default through July 1, 2016. In addition, we believe that we will be able to maintain compliance with the other financial covenants contained in the Hercules Loan Agreement through 2016 as a result of our cost and capital expenditure control measures. We believe that we will be able to achieve the revenue and earnings targets for 2016 under the Hercules Loan Agreement, which equal 90% of the revenue estimated in our 2016 operating plan and 70% and 80% of the earnings estimated for the first and second six months, respectively, in our 2016 operating plan as approved by our board of directors.\nTo meet our liquidity needs, we expect to minimize increases in personnel until our business performance has improved and supports additional costs. However, we may need to implement further cost reductions in our operating expenses to maintain a sufficient cash balance to fund its operations and maintain compliance with the minimum cash balance requirement under the Hercules Loan Agreement. Should it become necessary, we would implement additional cost reductions primarily through forgoing certain discretionary compensation increases, and further constraining identified non-critical product investments, and marketing and other costs, including reductions in personnel related to those activities. These identified potential actions, commencing as soon as May 2016, comprise a developed plan to reduce such costs by $4.6 million, net of implementation costs. In addition, we would consider borrowing up to an additional $5.0 million under the current VantagePoint notes purchase agreement, however such borrowings would be subject to VantagePoint's willingness to lend and Hercules' consent. We will continue to evaluate the extent and effectiveness of our cost-saving measures and monitor expenses compared to revenue and intend to implement additional cost reductions in future periods if and as circumstances warrant. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful or that further adverse events outside of our control may arise that would result in our inability to comply with the Hercules Loan Agreement's covenants. If an event of default were to occur, we may be required to obtain a further amendment or a waiver to the Hercules Loan Agreement, refinance the term loan, divest non-core assets or operations and/or obtain additional equity or debt financing. If we were unable to obtain such a waiver or amendment, or consummate such a transaction, the administrative agent could exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the term loan, including potential foreclosure against our assets securing the Hercules Loan Agreement, including our cash. Further, the VantagePoint Notes and Hercules Loan Agreement contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the term loan to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable.\nIn consideration of these conditions, we currently anticipate that funds expected to be generated from operations, including cost-saving measures we have taken and intend to take will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next twelve months. However, there is no assurance that the results of operations and cash flows expected during that period of time will be achieved\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents certain payments due under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by period (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,938 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hercules loan agreement (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,038 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> VantagePoint notes (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aggregate interest obligation (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,985 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,938 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n(1) Represents principal payments due on debt, including the credit against the final payment.\n(2) The VantagePoint Notes are subject to a subordination agreement with Hercules such that the VantagePoint Notes are subordinated in right of repayment to all of our obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement. In accordance with the subordination agreement, payment of the VantagePoint Notes would commence in the second quarter of 2018.\n(3) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding debt obligations that are payable in cash, including the end of term charge under the Hercules Loan agreement, and excluding capital lease obligations and, the non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs.\n(4) Includes principal and imputed interest.\nOperating Leases\nWe lease our primary office space in Woodland Hills, California; Plano, Texas; and other locations under various cancelable and non-cancelable operating leases that will expire between 2015 and 2024. All of our property and equipment have been purchased for cash or leased pursuant to capital leases.\nDuring 2015, we recorded facilities restructuring charges related to lease termination costs as a result of closing facilities as part of our restructuring plan. Operating lease payments in the table above include approximately $2.4 million of lease payments related to terminated or restructured leases, net of actual sublease income of $0.4 million, from operating lease commitments for those facilities. Amounts related to the lease terminations will be paid over the respective lease terms, the longest of which extends through 2024.\nHercules Loan Agreement\nWe have entered into the Loan Agreement with a principal amount of $25.0 million. The term loan has an annual interest rate equal to the greater of (i) 11.75% and (ii) the sum of (a) the prime rate, plus (b) 8.50%. The annual interest rate as of December 31, 2015 was 12.00%. We are required to make interest-only payments on the Hercules term loan through May 1, 2016, though such payments may be extended through August 1, 2016 and November 1, 2016 if we remain in continuous compliance with the financial covenants under the Hercules Loan Agreement through April 1, 2016 and July 1, 2016, respectively, and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing on such dates. The term loan matures on April 1, 2018 or, if the interest-only payments are extended through November 1, 2016, the term loan will mature October 1, 2018. For more information see the Financing Activities section above.\nVantagePoint Convertible Notes (Related Party)\nWe have entered into a convertible note agreement for the immediate issuance of $5.0 million of Convertible Second Lien Subordinated Notes. The notes bear an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded quarterly, and mature on April 15, 2018. Quarterly principle and interest payments are due starting April 15, 2017, subject to a subordination agreement with Hercules. For more information see the Financing Activities section above.\nPurchase Obligations\nWe have long-term purchase obligations outstanding with partners and third-party service providers for enhanced marketing functionality for our clients and for internal business software.\nCapital Leases\nWe have entered into non-cancelable capital leases for computer equipment. We recorded $1.2 million of capital leases, net of accumulated amortization of $0.8 million. The interest rates on these leases range from 4.8% to 5.2%. Interest payable on the lease obligations was $0.1 million as of December 31, 2015.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2015\nIn November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We early adopted this standard retrospectively and reclassified all of our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. Adoption resulted in a $1.8 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $0.1 million increase in other assets, and a $1.7 million increase in deferred rent and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest- Imputation of Interest. The amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The amendments in this update are effective for us as of January 1, 2016. We early adopted this update in the second quarter of 2015.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. The amendments in this update changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. The guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups as held for sale after the effective date, and was effective for us as of January 1, 2015. We have applied this guidance to our consolidated financial statements in 2015.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The amendments in this update supersedes the guidance in former Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 840, Leases with ASC 842, Leases, to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this update are effective for us as of January 1, 2019. Early application of this update is permitted. The guidance is required to be adopted at the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently assessing the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments- Overall. The amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments in this update are effective for us as of January 1, 2018. Early application of certain aspects of the amendment is permitted by public entities, otherwise early adoption is not permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this update require an acquirer to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this update are effective for us as of January 1, 2016. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this update. We are currently assessing the impact of this update, and believes that its adoption on January 1, 2016 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software. The amendments in this update provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The amendments in this update are effective for us as of January 1, 2016. We are currently assessing the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation. The amendments in this update require management to reevaluate whether certain legal entities should be consolidated. Specifically, the amendments (1) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, (2) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (3) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships, and (4) provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. The amendments in this update are effective for us as of January 1, 2016. We are currently assessing the impact of this update, and believe that its adoption on January 1, 2016 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern. The amendments in this update require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update are effective for us as of January 1, 2017. Early application is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. The amendments in this update require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. The amendments in this update will be effective for us as of January 1, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this update either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted, the cumulative effect of applying this update as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance at that date. In addition, if retrospective transition is adopted, an entity may use hindsight in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. We are currently assessing the impact of this update, and believe that its adoption on January 1, 2016 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The guidance in this update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. Additionally, this update supersedes some cost guidance included in ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition - Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (for example, assets within the scope of ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and intangible assets, within the scope of ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other) are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement in this update. The standard was to be effective for us as of January 1, 2017, but in August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of the new revenue accounting standard to January 1, 2019, and will permit early adoption as of the original effective date. Earlier adoption is not otherwise permitted for public entities. An entity can apply the revenue standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application in retained earnings (simplified transition method). We are currently assessing the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements.", "summary": "- The table is a summary of the company's financial position at the end of the most recent

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion together with Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including those we describe in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Part I, Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nReachLocal's mission is to provide more customers to businesses. We began in 2004 with the goal of helping local businesses move their advertising spend from traditional media and yellow pages to online search. While we have sold to a variety of local businesses and will continue to do so, our present focus is on small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and in particular, what we refer to as Premium SMBs. A Premium SMB generally has 10 to 30 employees, $1 to $10 million in annual revenue and spends approximately $40,000 annually on marketing. Premium SMBs have become increasingly sophisticated in their understanding of online marketing. However, we believe that Premium SMBs have not changed their desire for a single, unified solution to their marketing needs. Our goal is to provide a total digital marketing solution that will address Premium SMBs' online marketing needs. Our total digital marketing solution consists of products and solutions in three categories: digital advertising (including ReachSearch\u2122, ReachRetargeting\u2122, ReachDisplay\u2122, and ReachDisplay InAppTM ), web presence (including ReachSEO\u2122, ReachCast\u2122, TotalLiveChat\u2122, ReachSite+ReachEdge\u2122) and software (ReachEdge\u2122 and Kickserv\u2122).\nWe began by offering online advertising solutions with the rollout of ReachSearch in 2005, when we pioneered the provisioning of search engine marketing services (SEM) on a mass scale for local businesses through the use of our technology platform. ReachSearch combines search engine marketing optimized across multiple publishers, call tracking and call recording services, and industry leading campaign performance transparency. ReachSearch remains a leading SEM offering for local businesses and has won numerous awards since its rollout, including most recently winning Google's Quality Score Champion Award in North America and Latin America. However, ReachSearch does not solve all of the online advertising challenges of our clients. We have therefore added additional elements to our platform including our display product, ReachDisplay and ReachDisplay InApp, our behavioral targeting product, ReachRetargeting, and other products that are primarily focused on leveraging third-party media to drive leads to our clients.\nTo complement our online digital advertising solutions, we have also launched a number of presence solutions. These solutions include websites, social, search engine optimization (SEO), chat and other products and solutions, all focused on expanding and leveraging our clients' web presence. Often these products are designed to work in concert with our digital advertising products with a goal of enhancing the return to our clients. These products are generally available in North America and selectively available in our international markets.\nWe also recognize that even successfully driving leads to our clients does not represent a complete solution to local businesses' online marketing needs. In 2013, we expanded into lead conversion software with the introduction of ReachEdge in order to move beyond being a media-driven lead generation business to offering integrated solutions for our clients. ReachEdge is marketing automation and lead conversion software and includes tools for capturing web traffic information and converting leads into new customers. Initially, ReachEdge only came bundled with a responsive website. However, beginning in the first quarter of 2015, clients have been able to license ReachEdge's lead conversion software without having to also purchase a website, allowing us to sell ReachEdge to local businesses who do not need a new website or who purchase their website from another provider.\nOver time, we plan to add additional dynamic optimization functionality to ReachEdge, as well as features that create a more seamless relationship between our clients and their customers. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we acquired Kickserv, a provider of cloud-based business management software for service businesses. With this addition, we now have the ability to provide an end-to-end solution to our clients that starts with lead generation (ReachSearch, ReachDisplay and ReachSEO), includes lead conversion software (ReachEdge), and then closes and manages the business relationship (Kickserv). Local businesses already spend marketing dollars in these categories with a significant number of providers in a highly fragmented and confusing marketplace. Our integrated total marketing solution seeks to address this broad array of business needs with a simple integrated solution.\nIn North America, we sell our products and solutions directly, principally through our outside sales force and in certain situations, an inside sales force, in what we refer to as our Direct Local channel. Our sales personnel (primarily referred to as Digital Marketing Consultants or DMCs) both generate the sale and manage the client relationship. Each DMC is paired with a Marketing Expert (or ME) who provides day-to-day campaign management. We believe that this approach enables the DMC to focus primarily on selling and managing client relationships, while the client benefits from the support and expertise of dedicated MEs. We also have certain veteran salespeople that we refer to as IMCs who have more discretion to manage their client relationships and campaigns. Our international markets generally operate under a modified version of the North American model, suited for local market and product availability differences.\nWe refer to our separate sales channel targeting national brands, franchises and strategic accounts with operations in multiple local markets, and select third-party agencies and resellers as our NBAR channel. The sales process for the NBAR channel typically has substantially longer lead times than in our Direct Local channel. In addition, national brand clients often involve complexity due to operational and marketing requirements that are not normally required by our Direct Local clients. Our third-party agencies and reseller partners use our technology platform in customer segments where they have sales forces with established relationships with their client bases. We currently have over 350 agencies and resellers actively selling on our technology platform. We have a team that is responsible for identifying potential agencies and resellers, training their sales forces to sell our products and services and supporting the relationships on an ongoing basis.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015 we introduced our Web Partner Program, under which we distribute ReachEdge through third-party web developers. We are focusing on potential partners that typically have client bases ranging from 200 to 2,000 clients. By distributing ReachEdge with their platforms, Web Partners can deliver value to their clients while also earning an additional revenue stream. We believe that our Web Partner Program can increase our sales force's productivity by giving our sales people easier access to potential new clients.\nIn addition to the United States and Canada, we have sales operations in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria Brazil and Mexico. We exited direct sales in the United Kingdom market in the fourth quarter of 2015 when our local subsidiary ReachLocal UK Ltd. ( RL UK\u201d) entered administration and we continue to review our international operations in order to rationalize operations in overseas markets we determine to be underperforming and to optimize operations in our primary markets.\nOperating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of financial and operating metrics to evaluate our business, determine the allocation of resources and make decisions regarding business strategies.\nThe following table shows certain key operating metrics for the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n\n______________\n (1) (2) See Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\u201d for our definition of Active Clients. See Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\u201d for our definition of Active Product Units. \nActive Clients and Active Product Units\nWe track the number of Active Clients and Active Product Units to evaluate the growth, scale and diversification of our business. We also use these metrics to determine the needs and capacity of our sales forces, our support organization and other personnel and resources. The decrease in the number of Active Clients and Active Product Units is primarily due to an overall decrease in salespeople in both the Direct Local and NBAR channel as we decreased the size of our sales force in an effort to focus on more productive salespeople, partially offset by the addition of Kickserv clients and increased client retention in the Direct Local channel. The productivity of our current sales force improved compared to the prior-year period, but not enough to offset the decrease in number of sales people. Our exit from direct sales in the U.K. in the fourth quarter of 2015 reduced our number of Active Clients and Active Product Units at year-end and will continue to have a negative effect on those metrics in the first quarter of 2016.\nBasis of Presentation\nSources of Revenue\nWe derive our revenue principally from the provision and sale of online marketing products to our clients. Revenue includes (i) the sale of our ReachSearch, ReachRetargeting, ReachDisplay, and other products based on a package pricing model in which our clients commit to a fixed fee that includes the media, optimization, reporting and tracking technologies of our technology platform, and the personnel dedicated to support and manage their campaigns; (ii) the license (or sale) of ReachEdge, ReachSEO, ReachCast, TotalLiveChat, TotalTrack, ReachSite, Kickserv and other products and solutions; and (iii) set-up, management and service fees associated with these products and other solutions. We distribute our products and solutions directly through our outside and inside sales force that is focused on serving local businesses in their local markets through a consultative process, which we refer to as our Direct Local channel, as well as a separate sales force targeting our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers channel. The sales cycle for sales to our clients ranges from one day to over a month. Sales to our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers clients generally require several months.\nWe typically enter into multi-month agreements for the delivery of our products. Under our agreements, our Direct Local clients typically pay, in advance, a fixed fee on a monthly basis, which includes all charges for the included technology and any media services, management, third-party content and other costs and fees. We record these prepayments as deferred revenue and only recognize revenue in our statement of operations as we purchase media and perform other services on behalf of clients. Certain Direct Local clients are extended credit privileges with payment generally due in 30 days. Revenue from the licensing of our products is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable license or service period. There were $4.0 million and $3.2 million of accounts receivable related to our Direct Local channel at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nOur National Brands, Agencies and Resellers clients enter into agreements of various lengths or that are indefinite. Our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers clients either pay in advance or are extended credit privileges with payment generally due in 30 to 60 days. There were $3.3 million and $5.0 million of accounts receivable related to our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of the costs of online media acquired from third-party publishers. Media cost is recorded as cost of revenue in the period in which the corresponding revenue is recognized. From time to time, publishers offer us rebates based upon various factors and operating rules, including the amount of media purchased. We record these rebates in the period in which they are earned as a reduction to cost of revenue and the corresponding payable to the applicable publisher, or as other receivable, as appropriate. Cost of revenue also includes the third-party telephone and information services costs, other third-party service provider costs, data center and third-party hosting costs, credit card processing fees, and other direct costs.\nIn addition, cost of revenue includes costs to manage and operate our various solutions and technology infrastructure, other than costs associated with our sales force, which are reflected as selling and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation for the related staff, including our MEs who manage client accounts and provide client-facing support, and allocated overhead such as depreciation expense, rent and utilities. Cost of revenue also includes the amortization and impairment charges (as applicable) on acquired technology, customer relationships and trade names.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our selling and marketing staff, including salaries and wages, commissions and other variable compensation, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; travel and business costs; training, recruitment, marketing and promotional events; advertising; other brand building and product marketing expenses; and occupancy, technology and other direct overhead costs. A portion of the compensation for employees in the sales organization is based on commissions. In addition, the cost of agency commissions is included in selling and marketing expenses. Generally, commissions are expensed as earned. However, we pay commissions to certain sales people for the acquisition of new clients and because our client contracts are generally not cancelable without a penalty, we defer those commissions and amortize them over the initial contract term.\nProduct and Technology. Product and technology expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our product development and engineering professionals, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, and the cost of third-party contractors and certain third-party service providers and other expenses, including occupancy, technology and other direct overhead costs. Technology operations costs, including related personnel and third-party costs, are included in product and technology expenses. We capitalize a portion of costs as software development and, accordingly, include amortization of those costs as product and technology expenses. Our technology platform addresses all aspects of our activities, including supporting the selling and consultation process, integrating with online publishers, driving efficiency and optimization, providing insight to our clients into the results and effects of their online advertising campaigns and supporting financial and other back-office functions of our business.\nProduct and technology expenses also include the amortization of the technology obtained in acquisitions and the expensing of acquisition-related deferred payment obligations attributable to product and technology personnel. Product and technology expenses do not include the costs to deliver our solutions to clients, which are included in cost of revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for board, executive, legal, finance, human resources and corporate communications, including wages, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, professional fees, insurance premiums, business taxes and other expenses, including occupancy, technology and other direct overhead, public company costs and other corporate expenses.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges consist of costs associated with the realignment and reorganization of our operations. Restructuring charges include employee termination costs, facility closure and relocation costs, contract termination costs and costs associated with utilizing a third party consultant to facilitate the execution of our 2015 restructuring plan. The timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and can extend over a 12-month period or longer. We record liabilities related to restructuring charges in accrued restructuring in the consolidated balance sheets. See further discussion in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill Impairment. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, due to a decline in internal projections for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit of both revenue and profitability as a result of recent declines its financial performance, we determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim quantitative goodwill assessment for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015. The amount of goodwill assigned to the Asia-Pacific reporting unit at August 31, 2015 was $34.1 million. Based on our revised forecasts, the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit. As a result, we recorded an estimated impairment charge of $27.8 million for the goodwill in the Asia-Pacific reporting unit during the third quarter of 2015, which was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2015 without further adjustment and is included in impairment of goodwill in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We did not identify an impairment of our finite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets based on our estimates included in the second step of the quantitative test.\nThe process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires us to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. The estimated fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015 was determined using both an income-based valuation approach, and a market-based valuation approach, each weighted 50%. Under the income approach, fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using the discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method is dependent upon a number of factors, including projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows, assumed discount rates determined to be commensurate with the risks inherent in our business model, and other assumptions. The future cash flows for the reporting unit was projected based on our estimates, at that time, of future revenues, operating income and other factors (such as working capital and capital expenditures). We took into account expected competitive global industry and market conditions. Under the market-based valuation approach, each reporting unit's fair value is estimated based on industry multiples of revenues and operating earnings.\nThe inputs of the discounted cash flow method used to determine the fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit included a conservative average 3% growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 17%. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in (i) number of clients and active campaigns, which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand, including macroeconomic factors, competitive dynamics and changes in consumer preferences; (ii) marketing costs to generate new campaigns; and (iii) equity valuations of peer companies.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs a result of the disposal of our ClubLocal business in exchange for a minority equity interest in December 2013, we have reclassified and presented all related historical financial information with respect to ClubLocal as discontinued operations\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In addition, we have excluded all ClubLocal related activities from the following discussions, unless specifically referenced.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements:\n \u2022 Accounts receivable \n \u2022 Software development costs \n \u2022 Loan receivables \n \u2022 Non-marketable investments \n \u2022 Variable interest entities \n \u2022 Finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets \n \u2022 Goodwill \n \u2022 Revenue recognition \n \u2022 Restructuring charges \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation \n \u2022 Income taxes \nAccounts Receivable\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history, the customer's creditworthiness and various other factors, as determined by our review of their credit information. We monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any customer-specific collection issues that we have identified.\nSoftware Development Costs\nCosts to develop software for internal use are capitalized when we have determined that the development efforts will result in new or additional functionality or new products. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria and costs associated with ongoing maintenance are expensed as incurred and included in product and technology expenses, in addition to amortization of capitalized software development costs, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We monitor our existing capitalized software costs and reduce its carrying value as the result of releases that render previous features or functions obsolete. Software development costs are evaluated for impairment in accordance with our policy for finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Costs capitalized as internal use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three years.\nLoan Receivables\nWe record loan receivables at carrying value, net of potential allowance for losses. Losses on receivables are recorded when probable and estimable. Interest income on loan receivables is accrued on a monthly basis over the life of the loan, and interest recognition is suspended upon impairment of loan principal.\nNon-marketable Investments\nWe account for non-marketable investments under the cost method, which are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment. The fair value of a cost method investment is not evaluated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. However, if a significant adverse event were identified, we would estimate the fair value of its cost method investment considering available information at the time of the event, such as current cash position, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance and any other readily available data. If we determine that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the investment is written-down to its fair value.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe analyze our interests, including agreements, loans, guarantees, and equity investments, on a periodic basis to determine if such interests are variable interests. If variable interests are identified, then the related entity is assessed to determine if it is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d). Our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. We base our quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flows of the entity, and our qualitative analysis on the design of the entity, its organizational structure including its decision-making authority, and relevant agreements. If we determine that the entity is a VIE, we then assesses if we must consolidate the VIE as our primary beneficiary. Our determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is based upon qualitative and quantitative analyses, which assess the purpose and design of the VIE, the nature of the VIE's risks and the risks that we absorb, the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE.\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets are attributable to the various developed technologies, trade names, and customer relationships of the businesses we have acquired. We report finite-lived, acquisition-related intangible assets at acquisition date fair value, net of accumulated amortization. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years. Straight-line amortization is used as another pattern over which the economic benefits will be consumed cannot be reliably determined. We review the carrying values of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable. In our analysis of other finite-lived amortizable intangible assets, we apply the guidance of ASC 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, in determining whether any impairment conditions exist. An impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an intangible asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate, if it is determined that an asset is not recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset's fair value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no indications of impairment of our finite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquired businesses over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We account for goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill. ASC 350 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires us to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually.\nWe test the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the legal or business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key management or other personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the acquired business or our overall business, significant and sustained decline in market capitalization, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nTesting goodwill for impairment involves a two-step quantitative process. However, prior to performing the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether or not it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for selected reporting units. If we choose the qualitative option, we are not required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test unless we have determined, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair values of a reporting unit with its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, including goodwill, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, or if the reporting unit has a negative carrying value and we believe it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, then the second step is performed to compare the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value, which is determined by deducting the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nThe process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires us to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. The estimated fair value for each reporting unit is determined using both an income-based valuation approach, as well as a market-based valuation approach. Under the income approach, each reporting unit's fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method is dependent upon a number of factors, including projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows, assumed discount rates determined to be commensurate with the risks inherent in its business model, and other assumptions. Under the market-based valuation approach, each reporting unit's fair value is estimated based on industry multiples of revenues and operating earnings. The income-based approach is weighted between 50.0% and 66.7% depending on the amount and timing of projected operating earnings attributable to each reporting unit.\nWe operate in one reportable segment, in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, which is the basis that financial results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We have identified our reporting units as North America, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Europe. These reporting units each constitute a business or group of businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by each reporting unit's management. Our goodwill is comprised of balances in both the North America and Asia-Pacific reporting units.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2015, due to a decline in internal projections for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit of both revenue and profitability as a result of recent declines its financial performance, we determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim quantitative goodwill assessment for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015. The amount of goodwill assigned to the Asia-Pacific reporting unit at August 31, 2015 was $34.1 million. Based on our revised forecasts, the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit. As a result, we recorded an estimated impairment charge of $27.8 million for the goodwill in the Asia-Pacific reporting unit during the third quarter of 2015, which was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2015 without further adjustment and is included in impairment of goodwill in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We did not identify an impairment of our finite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets based on our estimates included in the second step of the quantitative test.\nThe process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires us to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. The estimated fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015 was determined using both an income-based valuation approach, and a market-based valuation approach, each weighted 50%. Under the income approach, fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using the discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method is dependent upon a number of factors, including projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows, assumed discount rates determined to be commensurate with the risks inherent in our business model, and other assumptions. The future cash flows for the reporting unit was projected based on our estimates, at that time, of future revenues, operating income and other factors (such as working capital and capital expenditures). We took into account expected competitive global industry and market conditions. Under the market-based valuation approach, each reporting unit's fair value is estimated based on industry multiples of revenues and operating earnings.\nThe inputs of the discounted cash flow method used to determine the fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit included a conservative average 3% growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 17%. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in (i) number of clients and active campaigns, which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand, including macroeconomic factors, competitive dynamics and changes in consumer preferences; (ii) marketing costs to generate new campaigns; and (iii) equity valuations of peer companies.\nAs of October 1, 2015, the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we considered our recent interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, which included a reconciliation of our total market capitalization based on the estimated fair value of our individual reporting units as of August 31, 2015. We qualitatively determined that then existing facts and circumstances were considered in our quantitative interim impairment test, such that it was not necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for our North America and Asia Pacific reporting units as of the annual testing date.\nAs of November 30, 2015, due to the then recent significant declines in our market capitalization and other changes in the business, including consideration of exiting the U.K. market, and the entrance of RL UK into administration, we determined that sufficient indicators existed to perform an interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment of our North America and Asia Pacific reporting units.\nThe first step of the November 30, 2015 quantitative goodwill impairment test resulted in the determination that the estimated fair value of both our North American reporting unit and our Asia Pacific reporting unit each substantially exceeded its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. Accordingly, the second step was not required. The inputs for the fair value calculations of the North America reporting unit included a conservative 2% growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 18%. The inputs for the fair value calculations of the Asia Pacific reporting unit included a conservative 2% growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 20.5%. In addition, we assumed revenue growth and applied margin and other cost assumptions consistent with each reporting unit's historical trends. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in (i) number of clients and active campaigns, which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand, including macroeconomic factors, competitive dynamics and changes in consumer preferences; (ii) marketing costs to generate new campaigns; and (iii) equity valuations of peer companies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue for our products and solutions when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been performed, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue for search engine marketing as clicks are recorded on sponsored links on the various search engines and for our display advertising and retargeting when the display advertisements record impressions or as otherwise provided in our agreement with the applicable publisher. We recognize revenue for lead conversion software, web presence and other products with a defined license or service period on a straight line basis over the applicable license or service period. We recognize revenue when we charge set-up, management service or other fees on a straight line basis over the term of the related contract or the completion of any obligation for services, if shorter. We account for sales and similar taxes imposed on our services on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWhen we receive advance payments from clients, we record these amounts as deferred revenue until the revenue is recognized. From time to time, we offer incentives to clients in exchange for minimum commitments. In these circumstances, we estimate the amount of the incentives that will be earned by clients and adjust the recognition of revenue to reflect such incentives. Estimates are either based upon a statistical analysis of previous campaigns for which such incentives were offered, or calculated on a straight-line basis over the life of the campaign.\nWhen we sell through agencies, we either receive payment in advance of the delivery of our products or solutions or in some cases extend credit. We pay each agency an agreed-upon commission based on the revenue we earn or cash we receive. Some agency clients that have been extended credit may offset the amount otherwise due to us by any commissions they have earned. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of campaign revenue or the net amount earned after commissions. As we are generally the primary party obligated in the arrangement, subject to the credit risk, with discretion over both price and media, we typically recognize the gross amount of such sales as revenue and any commissions are recognized as a selling and marketing expense.\nWe also have a small number of resellers. Resellers integrate our products and solutions, including branded search engine marketing, display advertising and online marketing analytics, into their product offerings. In most cases, the resellers integrate with our technology platform through a custom Application Programming Interface (API). Resellers are responsible for the price and specifications of the integrated product offered to their clients. Resellers pay us in arrears, net of commissions and other adjustments. We recognize revenue generated under reseller agreements net of the agreed-upon commissions and other adjustments earned or retained by the reseller, as we believe that the reseller has retained sufficient control and bears sufficient risks to be considered the primary obligor in those arrangements.\nRestructuring Charges\nWe record costs associated with exit activities related to restructuring plans in accordance with the ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Obligations. Liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred. Restructuring charges consist of costs associated with the realignment and reorganization of our operations. Restructuring charges include employee termination costs, facility closure and relocation costs, and contract termination costs. The timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and can extend over a 12-month period. We record restructuring charge liabilities in accrued restructuring in the consolidated balance sheet.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation based on the fair market value of the equity award on the date of grant. We follow the attribution method, which reduces current stock-based compensation expenses recorded by the effect of anticipated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based upon our historical experience.\nThe fair value of each award is estimated on the date of the grant and amortized over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant. Determining the fair value of stock option awards at the grant date under this model requires judgment, including estimating volatility, expected term and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. In addition, we use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of market-based performance-vesting restricted stock and restricted stock units. Determining the fair value of these awards at the grant date under this model requires judgment, including estimating volatility, risk-free rate and expected future stock price. We determine the probability of achievement of performance milestones for non-market based performance vesting restricted stock and restricted stock units, and recognize expense based on the fair value of the award if it is probable that the performance milestone will be achieved. The assumptions described above rely on management estimates based on judgment and subjective future expectations, which may result in stock-based compensation for future awards that differs significantly from the awards granted previously.\nThe fair value of modifications to stock-based awards is generally estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. If a stock-based compensation award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation expense is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. Incremental compensation expense for fully vested awards is recognized immediately. For unvested awards, the sum of the incremental compensation expense and the remaining unrecognized compensation expense for the original award on the modification date is recognized over the modified service period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes and evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities.\nFor the periods presented, income tax expense represents income taxes imposed by federal, state, foreign and local tax jurisdictions applicable to our activities. We are also generating net operating losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe that it is likely that taxes imposed by state, local and foreign jurisdictions will increase in magnitude, particularly to the extent we become profitable in certain jurisdictions before the time we obtain profitability on a consolidated basis.\nWe evaluate deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is required. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on the generation of future taxable income. Due to our recent history of cumulative losses, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, excluding indefinite lived assets in U.S. jurisdictions. We continue to monitor the valuation allowance at each reporting period, and at this time, it is uncertain when such a release will occur.\nThe value of our investments in foreign subsidiaries exceeds our tax basis in those subsidiaries by $1.0 million. However, we have not recognized deferred income taxes on the associated gain because the gain only becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from the subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of the subsidiary and these amounts are expected to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the U.S.\nWe are required to file income tax returns in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are, and from time to time, have been subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, which may disagree with our tax positions. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\n\n______________\n (1) Stock-based compensation, net of capitalization, and depreciation and amortization included in the above line-items (in thousands): \n\nRevenue\n\n\n\n____________\n (1) North America includes the United States and Canada. International includes all other countries. \n (2) Active Clients is a number we calculate to approximate the number of clients directly served through our Direct Local channel as well as clients served through our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers channel. We calculate Active Clients by adjusting the number of Active Product Units to combine clients with more than one Active Product Unit as a single Active Client. Clients with more than one location are generally reflected as multiple Active Clients. Because this number includes clients served through the National Brands, Agencies and Resellers channel, Active Clients includes entities with which we do not have a direct client relationship. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred. (3) Active Product Units is a number we calculate to approximate the number of individual products, licenses, or services we are providing under contract for Active Clients. For example, if we were performing both ReachSearch and ReachDisplay campaigns for a client that also licenses ReachEdge, we consider that three Active Product Units. Similarly, if a client purchases ReachSearch campaigns for two different products or purposes, we consider that two Active Product Units. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred. \nNorth American revenue decreased by $43.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014. North America Direct Local revenue declined $27.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to smaller client bases entering the period and fewer new client acquisitions during the period due to a more difficult selling environment and fewer salespeople as we decreased the size of our salesforce in an effort to focus on more productive salespeople, partially offset by improvements in client retention. The average productivity of our current sales force improved compared to the prior-year period, but did not improve enough to offset client cancellations and fewer salespeople. North America National Brands, Agencies and Resellers revenue decreased by $16.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in client acquisitions and a decrease in client budgets in both the National Brands and Agencies and Resellers channels due to losses of key partners in both channels.\nInternational revenue decreased by $48.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014. International revenue was negatively impacted by foreign currency translations of $24.1 million due to the substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, particularly the euro and Australian dollar. International Direct Local decreased by $24.8 million, on a constant currency basis compared to the prior-year period, due to smaller client bases entering the periods and fewer new client acquisitions during the periods due to a more difficult selling environment and fewer salespeople as we contracted our salesforce during the ongoing transition to our new sales model, partially offset by an improvement in client retention. The decrease in 2015, was partially offset by an increase of $1.6 million of revenue from former SureFire clients being reported in the Direct Local channel rather than the National Brands, Agencies and Resellers channel as in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of the SureFire revenue, the International National Brands, Agencies and Resellers revenue remained relatively flat on a constant currency basis compared to 2014. International revenue related to our U.K. market, which we exited in 2015, was $25.2 million", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion together with Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including those we describe in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Part I, Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nReachLocal's mission is to provide more customers to businesses. We began in 2004 with the goal of helping local businesses move their advertising spend from traditional media and yellow pages to online search. While we have sold to a variety of local businesses and will continue to do so, our present focus is on small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and in particular, what we refer to as Premium SMBs. A Premium SMB generally has 10 to 30 employees, $1 to $10 million in annual revenue and spends approximately $40,000 annually on marketing. Premium SMBs have become increasingly sophisticated in their understanding of online marketing. However, we believe that Premium SMBs have not changed their desire for a single, unified solution to their marketing needs. Our goal is to provide a total digital marketing solution that will address Premium SMBs' online marketing needs. Our total digital marketing solution consists of products and solutions in three categories: digital advertising (including ReachSearch\u2122, ReachRetargeting\u2122, ReachDisplay\u2122, and ReachDisplay InAppTM ), web presence (including ReachSEO\u2122, ReachCast\u2122, TotalLiveChat\u2122, ReachSite+ReachEdge\u2122) and software (ReachEdge\u2122 and Kickserv\u2122).\nWe began by offering online advertising solutions with the rollout of ReachSearch in 2005, when we pioneered the provisioning of search engine marketing services (SEM) on a mass scale for local businesses through the use of our technology platform. ReachSearch combines search engine marketing optimized across multiple publishers, call tracking and call recording services, and industry leading campaign performance transparency. ReachSearch remains a leading SEM offering for local businesses and has won numerous awards since its rollout, including most recently winning Google's Quality Score Champion Award in North America and Latin America. However, ReachSearch does not solve all of the online advertising challenges of our clients. We have therefore added additional elements to our platform including our display product, ReachDisplay and ReachDisplay InApp, our behavioral targeting product, ReachRetargeting, and other products that are primarily focused on leveraging third-party media to drive leads to our clients.\nTo complement our online digital advertising solutions, we have also launched a number of presence solutions. These solutions include websites, social, search engine optimization (SEO), chat and other products and solutions, all focused on expanding and leveraging our clients' web presence. Often these products are designed to work in concert with our digital advertising products with a goal of enhancing the return to our clients. These products are generally available in North America and selectively available in our international markets.\nWe also recognize that even successfully driving leads to our clients does not represent a complete solution to local businesses' online marketing needs. In 2013, we expanded into lead conversion software with the introduction of ReachEdge in order to move beyond being a media-driven lead generation business to offering integrated solutions for our clients. ReachEdge is marketing automation and lead conversion software and includes tools for capturing web traffic information and converting leads into new customers. Initially, ReachEdge only came bundled with a responsive website. However, beginning in the first quarter of 2015, clients have been able to license ReachEdge's lead conversion software without having to also purchase a website, allowing us to sell ReachEdge to local businesses who do not need a new website or who purchase their website from another provider.\nOver time, we plan to add additional dynamic optimization functionality to ReachEdge, as well as features that create a more seamless relationship between our clients and their customers. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we acquired Kickserv, a provider of cloud-based business management software for service businesses. With this addition, we now have the ability to provide an end-to-end solution to our clients that starts with lead generation (ReachSearch, ReachDisplay and ReachSEO), includes lead conversion software (ReachEdge), and then closes and manages the business relationship (Kickserv). Local businesses already spend marketing dollars in these categories with a significant number of providers in a highly fragmented and confusing marketplace. Our integrated total marketing solution seeks to address this broad array of business needs with a simple integrated solution.\nIn North America, we sell our products and solutions directly, principally through our outside sales force and in certain situations, an inside sales force, in what we refer to as our Direct Local channel. Our sales personnel (primarily referred to as Digital Marketing Consultants or DMCs) both generate the sale and manage the client relationship. Each DMC is paired with a Marketing Expert (or ME) who provides day-to-day campaign management. We believe that this approach enables the DMC to focus primarily on selling and managing client relationships, while the client benefits from the support and expertise of dedicated MEs. We also have certain veteran salespeople that we refer to as IMCs who have more discretion to manage their client relationships and campaigns. Our international markets generally operate under a modified version of the North American model, suited for local market and product availability differences.\nWe refer to our separate sales channel targeting national brands, franchises and strategic accounts with operations in multiple local markets, and select third-party agencies and resellers as our NBAR channel. The sales process for the NBAR channel typically has substantially longer lead times than in our Direct Local channel. In addition, national brand clients often involve complexity due to operational and marketing requirements that are not normally required by our Direct Local clients. Our third-party agencies and reseller partners use our technology platform in customer segments where they have sales forces with established relationships with their client bases. We currently have over 350 agencies and resellers actively selling on our technology platform. We have a team that is responsible for identifying potential agencies and resellers, training their sales forces to sell our products and services and supporting the relationships on an ongoing basis.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015 we introduced our Web Partner Program, under which we distribute ReachEdge through third-party web developers. We are focusing on potential partners that typically have client bases ranging from 200 to 2,000 clients. By distributing ReachEdge with their platforms, Web Partners can deliver value to their clients while also earning an additional revenue stream. We believe that our Web Partner Program can increase our sales force's productivity by giving our sales people easier access to potential new clients.\nIn addition to the United States and Canada, we have sales operations in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria Brazil and Mexico. We exited direct sales in the United Kingdom market in the fourth quarter of 2015 when our local subsidiary ReachLocal UK Ltd. ( RL UK\u201d) entered administration and we continue to review our international operations in order to rationalize operations in overseas markets we determine to be underperforming and to optimize operations in our primary markets.\nOperating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of financial and operating metrics to evaluate our business, determine the allocation of resources and make decisions regarding business strategies.\nThe following table shows certain key operating metrics for the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Active Clients (at period end) (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,900 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Active Product Units (at period end) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\n (1) (2) See Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\u201d for our definition of Active Clients. See Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\u201d for our definition of Active Product Units. \nActive Clients and Active Product Units\nWe track the number of Active Clients and Active Product Units to evaluate the growth, scale and diversification of our business. We also use these metrics to determine the needs and capacity of our sales forces, our support organization and other personnel and resources. The decrease in the number of Active Clients and Active Product Units is primarily due to an overall decrease in salespeople in both the Direct Local and NBAR channel as we decreased the size of our sales force in an effort to focus on more productive salespeople, partially offset by the addition of Kickserv clients and increased client retention in the Direct Local channel. The productivity of our current sales force improved compared to the prior-year period, but not enough to offset the decrease in number of sales people. Our exit from direct sales in the U.K. in the fourth quarter of 2015 reduced our number of Active Clients and Active Product Units at year-end and will continue to have a negative effect on those metrics in the first quarter of 2016.\nBasis of Presentation\nSources of Revenue\nWe derive our revenue principally from the provision and sale of online marketing products to our clients. Revenue includes (i) the sale of our ReachSearch, ReachRetargeting, ReachDisplay, and other products based on a package pricing model in which our clients commit to a fixed fee that includes the media, optimization, reporting and tracking technologies of our technology platform, and the personnel dedicated to support and manage their campaigns; (ii) the license (or sale) of ReachEdge, ReachSEO, ReachCast, TotalLiveChat, TotalTrack, ReachSite, Kickserv and other products and solutions; and (iii) set-up, management and service fees associated with these products and other solutions. We distribute our products and solutions directly through our outside and inside sales force that is focused on serving local businesses in their local markets through a consultative process, which we refer to as our Direct Local channel, as well as a separate sales force targeting our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers channel. The sales cycle for sales to our clients ranges from one day to over a month. Sales to our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers clients generally require several months.\nWe typically enter into multi-month agreements for the delivery of our products. Under our agreements, our Direct Local clients typically pay, in advance, a fixed fee on a monthly basis, which includes all charges for the included technology and any media services, management, third-party content and other costs and fees. We record these prepayments as deferred revenue and only recognize revenue in our statement of operations as we purchase media and perform other services on behalf of clients. Certain Direct Local clients are extended credit privileges with payment generally due in 30 days. Revenue from the licensing of our products is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable license or service period. There were $4.0 million and $3.2 million of accounts receivable related to our Direct Local channel at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nOur National Brands, Agencies and Resellers clients enter into agreements of various lengths or that are indefinite. Our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers clients either pay in advance or are extended credit privileges with payment generally due in 30 to 60 days. There were $3.3 million and $5.0 million of accounts receivable related to our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of the costs of online media acquired from third-party publishers. Media cost is recorded as cost of revenue in the period in which the corresponding revenue is recognized. From time to time, publishers offer us rebates based upon various factors and operating rules, including the amount of media purchased. We record these rebates in the period in which they are earned as a reduction to cost of revenue and the corresponding payable to the applicable publisher, or as other receivable, as appropriate. Cost of revenue also includes the third-party telephone and information services costs, other third-party service provider costs, data center and third-party hosting costs, credit card processing fees, and other direct costs.\nIn addition, cost of revenue includes costs to manage and operate our various solutions and technology infrastructure, other than costs associated with our sales force, which are reflected as selling and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation for the related staff, including our MEs who manage client accounts and provide client-facing support, and allocated overhead such as depreciation expense, rent and utilities. Cost of revenue also includes the amortization and impairment charges (as applicable) on acquired technology, customer relationships and trade names.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our selling and marketing staff, including salaries and wages, commissions and other variable compensation, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; travel and business costs; training, recruitment, marketing and promotional events; advertising; other brand building and product marketing expenses; and occupancy, technology and other direct overhead costs. A portion of the compensation for employees in the sales organization is based on commissions. In addition, the cost of agency commissions is included in selling and marketing expenses. Generally, commissions are expensed as earned. However, we pay commissions to certain sales people for the acquisition of new clients and because our client contracts are generally not cancelable without a penalty, we defer those commissions and amortize them over the initial contract term.\nProduct and Technology. Product and technology expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our product development and engineering professionals, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, and the cost of third-party contractors and certain third-party service providers and other expenses, including occupancy, technology and other direct overhead costs. Technology operations costs, including related personnel and third-party costs, are included in product and technology expenses. We capitalize a portion of costs as software development and, accordingly, include amortization of those costs as product and technology expenses. Our technology platform addresses all aspects of our activities, including supporting the selling and consultation process, integrating with online publishers, driving efficiency and optimization, providing insight to our clients into the results and effects of their online advertising campaigns and supporting financial and other back-office functions of our business.\nProduct and technology expenses also include the amortization of the technology obtained in acquisitions and the expensing of acquisition-related deferred payment obligations attributable to product and technology personnel. Product and technology expenses do not include the costs to deliver our solutions to clients, which are included in cost of revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for board, executive, legal, finance, human resources and corporate communications, including wages, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, professional fees, insurance premiums, business taxes and other expenses, including occupancy, technology and other direct overhead, public company costs and other corporate expenses.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges consist of costs associated with the realignment and reorganization of our operations. Restructuring charges include employee termination costs, facility closure and relocation costs, contract termination costs and costs associated with utilizing a third party consultant to facilitate the execution of our 2015 restructuring plan. The timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and can extend over a 12-month period or longer. We record liabilities related to restructuring charges in accrued restructuring in the consolidated balance sheets. See further discussion in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill Impairment. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, due to a decline in internal projections for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit of both revenue and profitability as a result of recent declines its financial performance, we determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim quantitative goodwill assessment for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015. The amount of goodwill assigned to the Asia-Pacific reporting unit at August 31, 2015 was $34.1 million. Based on our revised forecasts, the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit. As a result, we recorded an estimated impairment charge of $27.8 million for the goodwill in the Asia-Pacific reporting unit during the third quarter of 2015, which was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2015 without further adjustment and is included in impairment of goodwill in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We did not identify an impairment of our finite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets based on our estimates included in the second step of the quantitative test.\nThe process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires us to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. The estimated fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015 was determined using both an income-based valuation approach, and a market-based valuation approach, each weighted 50%. Under the income approach, fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using the discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method is dependent upon a number of factors, including projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows, assumed discount rates determined to be commensurate with the risks inherent in our business model, and other assumptions. The future cash flows for the reporting unit was projected based on our estimates, at that time, of future revenues, operating income and other factors (such as working capital and capital expenditures). We took into account expected competitive global industry and market conditions. Under the market-based valuation approach, each reporting unit's fair value is estimated based on industry multiples of revenues and operating earnings.\nThe inputs of the discounted cash flow method used to determine the fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit included a conservative average 3% growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 17%. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in (i) number of clients and active campaigns, which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand, including macroeconomic factors, competitive dynamics and changes in consumer preferences; (ii) marketing costs to generate new campaigns; and (iii) equity valuations of peer companies.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs a result of the disposal of our ClubLocal business in exchange for a minority equity interest in December 2013, we have reclassified and presented all related historical financial information with respect to ClubLocal as discontinued operations\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In addition, we have excluded all ClubLocal related activities from the following discussions, unless specifically referenced.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements:\n \u2022 Accounts receivable \n \u2022 Software development costs \n \u2022 Loan receivables \n \u2022 Non-marketable investments \n \u2022 Variable interest entities \n \u2022 Finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets \n \u2022 Goodwill \n \u2022 Revenue recognition \n \u2022 Restructuring charges \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation \n \u2022 Income taxes \nAccounts Receivable\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history, the customer's creditworthiness and various other factors, as determined by our review of their credit information. We monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any customer-specific collection issues that we have identified.\nSoftware Development Costs\nCosts to develop software for internal use are capitalized when we have determined that the development efforts will result in new or additional functionality or new products. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria and costs associated with ongoing maintenance are expensed as incurred and included in product and technology expenses, in addition to amortization of capitalized software development costs, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We monitor our existing capitalized software costs and reduce its carrying value as the result of releases that render previous features or functions obsolete. Software development costs are evaluated for impairment in accordance with our policy for finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Costs capitalized as internal use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three years.\nLoan Receivables\nWe record loan receivables at carrying value, net of potential allowance for losses. Losses on receivables are recorded when probable and estimable. Interest income on loan receivables is accrued on a monthly basis over the life of the loan, and interest recognition is suspended upon impairment of loan principal.\nNon-marketable Investments\nWe account for non-marketable investments under the cost method, which are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment. The fair value of a cost method investment is not evaluated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. However, if a significant adverse event were identified, we would estimate the fair value of its cost method investment considering available information at the time of the event, such as current cash position, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance and any other readily available data. If we determine that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the investment is written-down to its fair value.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe analyze our interests, including agreements, loans, guarantees, and equity investments, on a periodic basis to determine if such interests are variable interests. If variable interests are identified, then the related entity is assessed to determine if it is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d). Our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. We base our quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flows of the entity, and our qualitative analysis on the design of the entity, its organizational structure including its decision-making authority, and relevant agreements. If we determine that the entity is a VIE, we then assesses if we must consolidate the VIE as our primary beneficiary. Our determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is based upon qualitative and quantitative analyses, which assess the purpose and design of the VIE, the nature of the VIE's risks and the risks that we absorb, the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE.\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets are attributable to the various developed technologies, trade names, and customer relationships of the businesses we have acquired. We report finite-lived, acquisition-related intangible assets at acquisition date fair value, net of accumulated amortization. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years. Straight-line amortization is used as another pattern over which the economic benefits will be consumed cannot be reliably determined. We review the carrying values of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable. In our analysis of other finite-lived amortizable intangible assets, we apply the guidance of ASC 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, in determining whether any impairment conditions exist. An impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an intangible asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate, if it is determined that an asset is not recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset's fair value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no indications of impairment of our finite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquired businesses over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We account for goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill. ASC 350 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires us to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually.\nWe test the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the legal or business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key management or other personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the acquired business or our overall business, significant and sustained decline in market capitalization, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nTesting goodwill for impairment involves a two-step quantitative process. However, prior to performing the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether or not it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for selected reporting units. If we choose the qualitative option, we are not required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test unless we have determined, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair values of a reporting unit with its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, including goodwill, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, or if the reporting unit has a negative carrying value and we believe it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, then the second step is performed to compare the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value, which is determined by deducting the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nThe process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires us to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. The estimated fair value for each reporting unit is determined using both an income-based valuation approach, as well as a market-based valuation approach. Under the income approach, each reporting unit's fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method is dependent upon a number of factors, including projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows, assumed discount rates determined to be commensurate with the risks inherent in its business model, and other assumptions. Under the market-based valuation approach, each reporting unit's fair value is estimated based on industry multiples of revenues and operating earnings. The income-based approach is weighted between 50.0% and 66.7% depending on the amount and timing of projected operating earnings attributable to each reporting unit.\nWe operate in one reportable segment, in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, which is the basis that financial results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We have identified our reporting units as North America, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Europe. These reporting units each constitute a business or group of businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by each reporting unit's management. Our goodwill is comprised of balances in both the North America and Asia-Pacific reporting units.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2015, due to a decline in internal projections for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit of both revenue and profitability as a result of recent declines its financial performance, we determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim quantitative goodwill assessment for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015. The amount of goodwill assigned to the Asia-Pacific reporting unit at August 31, 2015 was $34.1 million. Based on our revised forecasts, the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill for the Asia-Pacific reporting unit. As a result, we recorded an estimated impairment charge of $27.8 million for the goodwill in the Asia-Pacific reporting unit during the third quarter of 2015, which was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2015 without further adjustment and is included in impairment of goodwill in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We did not identify an impairment of our finite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets based on our estimates included in the second step of the quantitative test.\nThe process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires us to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. The estimated fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit as of August 31, 2015 was determined using both an income-based valuation approach, and a market-based valuation approach, each weighted 50%. Under the income approach, fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using the discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method is dependent upon a number of factors, including projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows, assumed discount rates determined to be commensurate with the risks inherent in our business model, and other assumptions. The future cash flows for the reporting unit was projected based on our estimates, at that time, of future revenues, operating income and other factors (such as working capital and capital expenditures). We took into account expected competitive global industry and market conditions. Under the market-based valuation approach, each reporting unit's fair value is estimated based on industry multiples of revenues and operating earnings.\nThe inputs of the discounted cash flow method used to determine the fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit included a conservative average 3% growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 17%. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in (i) number of clients and active campaigns, which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand, including macroeconomic factors, competitive dynamics and changes in consumer preferences; (ii) marketing costs to generate new campaigns; and (iii) equity valuations of peer companies.\nAs of October 1, 2015, the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we considered our recent interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, which included a reconciliation of our total market capitalization based on the estimated fair value of our individual reporting units as of August 31, 2015. We qualitatively determined that then existing facts and circumstances were considered in our quantitative interim impairment test, such that it was not necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for our North America and Asia Pacific reporting units as of the annual testing date.\nAs of November 30, 2015, due to the then recent significant declines in our market capitalization and other changes in the business, including consideration of exiting the U.K. market, and the entrance of RL UK into administration, we determined that sufficient indicators existed to perform an interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment of our North America and Asia Pacific reporting units.\nThe first step of the November 30, 2015 quantitative goodwill impairment test resulted in the determination that the estimated fair value of both our North American reporting unit and our Asia Pacific reporting unit each substantially exceeded its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. Accordingly, the second step was not required. The inputs for the fair value calculations of the North America reporting unit included a conservative 2% growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 18%. The inputs for the fair value calculations of the Asia Pacific reporting unit included a conservative 2% growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 20.5%. In addition, we assumed revenue growth and applied margin and other cost assumptions consistent with each reporting unit's historical trends. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in (i) number of clients and active campaigns, which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand, including macroeconomic factors, competitive dynamics and changes in consumer preferences; (ii) marketing costs to generate new campaigns; and (iii) equity valuations of peer companies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue for our products and solutions when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been performed, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue for search engine marketing as clicks are recorded on sponsored links on the various search engines and for our display advertising and retargeting when the display advertisements record impressions or as otherwise provided in our agreement with the applicable publisher. We recognize revenue for lead conversion software, web presence and other products with a defined license or service period on a straight line basis over the applicable license or service period. We recognize revenue when we charge set-up, management service or other fees on a straight line basis over the term of the related contract or the completion of any obligation for services, if shorter. We account for sales and similar taxes imposed on our services on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWhen we receive advance payments from clients, we record these amounts as deferred revenue until the revenue is recognized. From time to time, we offer incentives to clients in exchange for minimum commitments. In these circumstances, we estimate the amount of the incentives that will be earned by clients and adjust the recognition of revenue to reflect such incentives. Estimates are either based upon a statistical analysis of previous campaigns for which such incentives were offered, or calculated on a straight-line basis over the life of the campaign.\nWhen we sell through agencies, we either receive payment in advance of the delivery of our products or solutions or in some cases extend credit. We pay each agency an agreed-upon commission based on the revenue we earn or cash we receive. Some agency clients that have been extended credit may offset the amount otherwise due to us by any commissions they have earned. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of campaign revenue or the net amount earned after commissions. As we are generally the primary party obligated in the arrangement, subject to the credit risk, with discretion over both price and media, we typically recognize the gross amount of such sales as revenue and any commissions are recognized as a selling and marketing expense.\nWe also have a small number of resellers. Resellers integrate our products and solutions, including branded search engine marketing, display advertising and online marketing analytics, into their product offerings. In most cases, the resellers integrate with our technology platform through a custom Application Programming Interface (API). Resellers are responsible for the price and specifications of the integrated product offered to their clients. Resellers pay us in arrears, net of commissions and other adjustments. We recognize revenue generated under reseller agreements net of the agreed-upon commissions and other adjustments earned or retained by the reseller, as we believe that the reseller has retained sufficient control and bears sufficient risks to be considered the primary obligor in those arrangements.\nRestructuring Charges\nWe record costs associated with exit activities related to restructuring plans in accordance with the ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Obligations. Liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred. Restructuring charges consist of costs associated with the realignment and reorganization of our operations. Restructuring charges include employee termination costs, facility closure and relocation costs, and contract termination costs. The timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and can extend over a 12-month period. We record restructuring charge liabilities in accrued restructuring in the consolidated balance sheet.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation based on the fair market value of the equity award on the date of grant. We follow the attribution method, which reduces current stock-based compensation expenses recorded by the effect of anticipated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based upon our historical experience.\nThe fair value of each award is estimated on the date of the grant and amortized over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant. Determining the fair value of stock option awards at the grant date under this model requires judgment, including estimating volatility, expected term and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. In addition, we use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of market-based performance-vesting restricted stock and restricted stock units. Determining the fair value of these awards at the grant date under this model requires judgment, including estimating volatility, risk-free rate and expected future stock price. We determine the probability of achievement of performance milestones for non-market based performance vesting restricted stock and restricted stock units, and recognize expense based on the fair value of the award if it is probable that the performance milestone will be achieved. The assumptions described above rely on management estimates based on judgment and subjective future expectations, which may result in stock-based compensation for future awards that differs significantly from the awards granted previously.\nThe fair value of modifications to stock-based awards is generally estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. If a stock-based compensation award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation expense is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. Incremental compensation expense for fully vested awards is recognized immediately. For unvested awards, the sum of the incremental compensation expense and the remaining unrecognized compensation expense for the original award on the modification date is recognized over the modified service period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes and evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities.\nFor the periods presented, income tax expense represents income taxes imposed by federal, state, foreign and local tax jurisdictions applicable to our activities. We are also generating net operating losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe that it is likely that taxes imposed by state, local and foreign jurisdictions will increase in magnitude, particularly to the extent we become profitable in certain jurisdictions before the time we obtain profitability on a consolidated basis.\nWe evaluate deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is required. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on the generation of future taxable income. Due to our recent history of cumulative losses, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, excluding indefinite lived assets in U.S. jurisdictions. We continue to monitor the valuation allowance at each reporting period, and at this time, it is uncertain when such a release will occur.\nThe value of our investments in foreign subsidiaries exceeds our tax basis in those subsidiaries by $1.0 million. However, we have not recognized deferred income taxes on the associated gain because the gain only becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from the subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of the subsidiary and these amounts are expected to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the U.S.\nWe are required to file income tax returns in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are, and from time to time, have been subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, which may disagree with our tax positions. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.\nResults of

International includes all other countries. \n (2) Active Clients is a number we calculate to approximate the number of clients directly served through our Direct Local channel as well as clients served through our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers channel. We calculate Active Clients by adjusting the number of Active Product Units to combine clients with more than one Active Product Unit as a single Active Client. Clients with more than one location are generally reflected as multiple Active Clients. Because this number includes clients served through the National Brands, Agencies and Resellers channel, Active Clients includes entities with which we do not have a direct client relationship. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred. (3) Active Product Units is a number we calculate to approximate the number of individual products, licenses, or services we are providing under contract for Active Clients. For example, if we were performing both ReachSearch and ReachDisplay campaigns for a client that also licenses ReachEdge, we consider that three Active Product Units. Similarly, if a client purchases ReachSearch campaigns for two different products or purposes, we consider that two Active Product Units. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred. \nNorth American revenue decreased by $43.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014. North America Direct Local revenue declined $27.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to smaller client bases entering the period and fewer new client acquisitions during the period due to a more difficult selling environment and fewer salespeople as we decreased the size of our salesforce in an effort to focus on more productive salespeople, partially offset by improvements in client retention. The average productivity of our current sales force improved compared to the prior-year period, but did not improve enough to offset client cancellations and fewer salespeople. North America National Brands, Agencies and Resellers revenue decreased by $16.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in client acquisitions and a decrease in client budgets in both the National Brands and Agencies and Resellers channels due to losses of key partners in both channels.\nInternational revenue decreased by $48.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014. International revenue was negatively impacted by foreign currency translations of $24.1 million due to the substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, particularly the euro and Australian dollar. International Direct Local decreased by $24.8 million, on a constant currency basis compared to the prior-year period, due to smaller client bases entering the periods and fewer new client acquisitions during the periods due to a more difficult selling environment and fewer salespeople as we contracted our salesforce during the ongoing transition to our new sales model, partially offset by an improvement in client retention. The decrease in 2015, was partially offset by an increase of $1.6 million of revenue from former SureFire clients being reported in the Direct Local channel rather than the National Brands, Agencies and Resellers channel as in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of the SureFire revenue, the International National Brands, Agencies and Resellers revenue remained relatively flat on a constant currency basis compared to 2014. International revenue related to our U.K. market, which we exited in 2015, was $25.2 million"}
