MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIntroduction\nThis discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and financial conditions during the fiscal years ended November 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental information in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered forward-looking. These statements contain a number of risks and uncertainties, as discussed under the heading \"Forward-Looking Statements\" of this Annual Report that could cause actual results to differ materially. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Our future results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nWe completed the acquisition of Hudson on September 30, 2013 and the information presented includes the results of operations of Hudson from that date through the end of our fiscal year of November 30, 2013, which was approximately two months of operations, and its financial results are included in each of the two reportable segments in a manner consistent with our reporting structure. Therefore, our results of operations for the fiscal year 2013 are not necessarily indicative of future results. Our financial results for fiscal 2015 and 2014 reflect a full year of operations for our Hudson subsidiary.\nWe completed the sale of certain of our operating and intellectual property assets related to the Joe's Business to two separate purchasers for an aggregate purchase price of $80 million in September 2015, and, as a result, sales of our Joe's\u00ae products are presented as held for sale (discontinued operations) in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. As part of the Asset Sale, we entered into the IP Asset Purchase Agreement with the IP Assets Purchaser and, solely for the purposes of its related guarantee, Sequential Brands Group, Inc., pursuant to which, the IP Assets Purchaser, among other things, purchased the Intellectual Property Assets used or held for use in the Joe's Business. The aggregate purchase price was $67 million. Simultaneous with the IP Asset Purchase Agreement, we entered into the Operating Asset Purchase Agreement with the Operating Assets Purchaser, pursuant to which the Operating Assets Purchaser, among other things, purchased certain inventory and other assets and assumed certain liabilities from us and our subsidiaries related to the Joe's Business, including certain employees of the Joe's Business and, at a later date, specified Joe's store leases. The aggregate purchase price was $13 million. At the closing of the sale, both the IP Assets Purchaser and the Operating Assets Purchaser deposited an aggregate of $4.0 million into an escrow account, which will be used to defer certain costs and expenses which may be incurred by us after the closing of the transaction.\nExecutive Overview and Subsequent Events\nOur principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing of apparel products, which include denim jeans, related casual wear and accessories that bear the brand Hudson\u00ae. Historically, until September 2015, we also had apparel products bearing the Joe's\u00ae brand. Joe's\u00ae was established in 2001 and the brand is recognized in the premium denim industry, an industry term for denim jeans with price points generally of $120 or more, for its quality, fit and fashion-forward designs.\nAs a result of the Asset Sale, sales of our Joe's\u00ae products are presented as held for sale (discontinued operations) in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Hudson\u00ae was established in 2002, and is similarly recognized as a premier designer and marketer of women's and men's premium branded denim apparel. Because we focus on design, development and marketing, we rely on third parties to manufacture our apparel products. We sell our products through our own retail stores, our websites and to numerous retailers, which include major department stores, specialty stores and distributors around the world.\nOn September 30, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Hudson for an aggregate purchase price consisting of approximately $65,416,000 in cash and approximately $27,451,000 in convertible notes, net of discount. This acquisition provided us with an additional proven premium denim brand and enhanced our prospects for growth across wholesale, retail and e-commerce, both domestically and overseas, and created the potential for improved purchasing authority with current and future vendors and other operational efficiencies. As of September 30, 2013, the acquired business represented approximately 40 percent of our consolidated total assets at November 30, 2013 and approximately three percent of consolidated net loss for the year ended November 30, 2013.\nDuring fiscal 2014 and 2015, we believed that our growth potential relied on the integration of the Hudson and Joe's Jeans operations. We did not achieve the desired level of integration on our original timetable. As a result, we failed to meet certain financial covenants set forth in the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement. On November 6, 2014, we received a notice of default and demand for payment of default interest from Garrison, as term loan agent, under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement. As a result of the default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, we were also in default under the terms of our CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and our factoring facility with CIT and we were prohibited from making payments under the Convertible Notes and the obligations to Mr. Dahan.\nAdditionally, during the first half of fiscal 2015, our business was also impacted by a decrease in overall sales in both our wholesale and retail segments. During fiscal 2014, our business was impacted by a decline in our overall Joe's\u00ae business, but offset by the addition of sales from the acquisition of Hudson. On a comparative basis, sales of our men's and women's denim bottoms were, and continue to be, impacted by a weakening in the overall denim market, as consumer preference shifts to non-denim bottoms. Both brands have been focused on designing new products in a variety of fits and washes with new and innovative fabrics to give the customer a reason to purchase a new pair of jeans. Beginning in fiscal 2012, we also offered a line, else\u2122, that had price points starting at $68 and was created to reach young women who are looking for a premium denim-like product at a more affordable price. As of fiscal 2014, we began to re-evaluate this brand and significant decreases in sales related to this brand impacted our comparative sales for fiscal 2014. We sold the else\u2122 trademark pursuant to the Asset Sale and at the time of the sale, the else\u2122 brand had very limited assets and distribution in the international market.\nOn January 19, 2015, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Marc. B. Crossman, resigned. As a result of the defaults and the resignation of our CEO, our Board determined that it was in the best interests of the company and our stockholders to explore all of strategic alternatives to remedy the defaults with our lenders and to find a new CEO to lead us. On January 29, 2015, we engaged Carl Marks Advisory Group Inc. (\"Carl Marks\") to help us explore all of our alternatives to resolve our financial condition. In March 2015, Carl Marks launched its strategic transaction process seeking proposals for transactions that would generate enough funds that would allow the Company to repay the term loan in full. The indications of interest were for a wide variety of transactions including a partial refinancing, IP sale/license transaction, asset sale transaction and a merger/recapitalization transaction. As part of the process, on September 8, 2015, we entered into various definitive agreements intended to provide a total solution to resolving the Company's operational, financial and management issues, pursuant to which we agreed to (i) the Asset Sale, which was completed\nSeptember 11, 2015, whereby we sold certain of our operating and intellectual property assets related to the Joe's Business for a total of $80 million, (ii) combine our remaining business operated under the Hudson brand with RG pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (iii) issue and sell $50 million of our Series A Preferred Stock in a private placement to an affiliate of TCP pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, (iv) exchange our outstanding Convertible Notes for a combination of cash, shares of our common stock and the Modified Convertible Notes and (v) gain a CEO with public company experience. On September 11, 2015, the proceeds of the Asset Sale were used to repay all of our indebtedness outstanding under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and a portion of our indebtedness outstanding under our Revolving Credit Agreement. As a result, the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement was paid in full and terminated on September 11, 2015 and we entered in the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with CIT, which provided for a maximum credit availability of $7.5 million and waived certain defaults. On January 28, 2016, all outstanding loans under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement were repaid and it was terminated in connection with entering into (i) a new credit and security agreement (the \"ABL Credit Agreement\") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as lender, and (ii) a new credit and security agreement with TCW Asset Management Company, as agent, and the lenders party thereto (the \"Term Credit Agreement\", and together with the ABL Credit Agreement, the \"New Credit Agreements\"). On January 28, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of RG, as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 8, 2015 (the \"Merger Agreement\"), by and among RG, Merger Sub and us, for an aggregate of $81.0 million in cash and 8,870,968 shares of our common stock (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split (as defined below)). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub was merged with and into RG, so that RG, as the surviving entity, became our wholly-owned subsidiary. RG is engaged in the design, development, sales and licensing of apparel products and accessories that bear the brand name Robert Graham\u00ae.\nEffective upon consummation of the Merger, we changed our name to Differential Brands Group Inc. and effected a reverse stock split (the \"Reverse Stock Split\") of our issued and outstanding common stock such that each thirty shares of our issued and outstanding common stock was reclassified into one share of our issued and outstanding common stock. The Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value or the amount of authorized shares of our common stock. The primary purpose of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the per-share market price of our common stock in order to maintain our listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market maintained by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"NASDAQ\").\nIn connection with the Merger, on January 28, 2016, we completed issuance and sale of an aggregate of fifty thousand (50,000) shares of our preferred stock, designated as \"Series A Convertible Preferred Stock\" (the \"Series A Preferred Stock\"), for an aggregate purchase price of $50 million in cash, as contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, dated as of September 8, 2015 (the \"Stock Purchase Agreement\"), by and between us and TCP Denim, LLC (the \"Series A Purchaser\").\nWe used the proceeds from the Stock Purchase Agreement and the debt financing provided by the credit facilities under the New Credit Agreements to, among other things, consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nAlso in connection with the completion of Merger, on January 28, 2016, we completed the exchange of our outstanding convertible notes for (i) 1,167,317 shares of common stock (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split); (ii) a cash payment of approximately $8.6 million; and (iii) an aggregate principal amount of approximately $16.5 million of modified convertible notes (the \"Modified Convertible Notes\"), as contemplated by the rollover agreement, dated September 8, 2015 (the \"Rollover Agreement\"), between us and the holders of our convertible notes.\nOur Joe's\u00ae product line, which was sold pursuant to the Asset Sale, included women's and men's denim jeans, pants, shirts, sweaters, jackets and other apparel products. We also offered under our\nJoe's\u00ae brand women's handbags and clutches, women's intimates, children's products, shoes, belts and leather goods produced by us or under various license agreements and we received royalty payments based upon net sales from licensees. Our Hudson\u00ae product line includes women's, men's and children's denim jeans, pants, jackets and other bottoms. Similar to the evolution of Joe's\u00ae, we continue to evaluate offering a range of products under the Hudson\u00ae brand name.\nOur Robert Graham\u00ae product line includes premium priced men's sport shirts, denim jeans, pants, shorts, sweaters, knits, t-shirts, sportcoats, outerwear, and swimwear. RG also offers a line of women's apparel, mainly in its own retail stores. Additionally, men's shoes, belts, small leather goods, dress shirts, neckwear, tailored clothing, headwear, eye and sun glasses, jewelry, hosiery, underwear, loungewear and fragrances are produced by third parties under various license agreements and RG receives royalty payments based upon net sales from licensees.\nAfter the closing of the Operating Asset Purchase Agreement and the IP Asset Purchase Agreement, we retained and operated 32 Joe's\u00ae brand retail stores. Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Asset Purchase Agreement, we transferred 18 retail stores to the Operating Assets Purchaser on January 28, 2016 for no additional consideration. As of February 29, 2016, the remaining 14 Joe's\u00ae brand retail stores were closed. The retail stores being transferred have been included as part of our discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report. The Operating Assets Purchaser supplies Joe's\u00ae branded merchandise to the retail stores for resale under a license from the IP Assets Purchaser. As of February 29, 2016 we had 30 Robert Graham\u00ae brand stores, which consisted of 18 full price stores and 12 outlet stores. Two additional leases for Robert Graham\u00ae brand full price stores have been signed for 2016 openings.\nFor 2016, we believe that our growth drivers will be dependent upon the successful integration of the Hudson Business and the Robert Graham Business as a result of the Merger, which includes reducing expenses and achieving synergies that we expect as a result of the Merger. Other growth drivers include cost saving measures related to the operation of our Hudson Business and the performance of each of our Hudson Business and our Robert Graham Business.\nOur business is seasonal. The majority of the marketing and sales orders take place from late fall to late spring. The greatest volume of shipments and actual sales are generally made from summer through early fall, which coincides with our third and fourth fiscal quarters, and accordingly, our cash flow is strongest in those quarters. Due to the seasonality of our business, as well as the evolution and changes in our business and product mix, including our acquisition of Hudson, the sale of the Joe's Business, and the acquisition of the Robert Graham Business, our quarterly or yearly results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next quarter or year. Furthermore, because of the growing number of full-price retail and outlet stores opened at different points during the past few fiscal years, we continue to assess the seasonality of our business on our retail segment and its potential impact on our financial results.\nOur reportable business segments are Wholesale and Retail. We manage, evaluate and aggregate our operating segments for segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of business activity and operation. As of November 30, 2015, our Wholesale segment was comprised of sales of Hudson\u00ae products to retailers, specialty stores and international distributors, revenue from licensing agreements and includes expenses from sales, trade shows, distribution, product samples and customer service departments. As of November 30, 2015, our Retail segment was comprised of sales to consumers through ten Joe's\u00ae full-price retail stores, 11 Joe's\u00ae outlet stores and through our online retail site at www.hudsonjeans.com. Our Corporate and other is comprised of expenses from corporate operations, which include the executive, finance, legal, human resources, design and production departments and general advertising expenses associated with our products.\nSales of our Joe's\u00ae and else\u2122 products for our wholesale segment and for those retail stores being transferred pursuant to the Operating Assets Purchase Agreement and Joe's\u00ae online retail site are\npresented as discontinued operations as a result of the sale of those assets in our condensed consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.\nComparison of Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2015 to Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2014\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

$80,199,000 in fiscal 2015 from $84,225,000 in fiscal 2014, a five percent decrease. Sales of our men's and women's denim bottoms continue to be impacted by a weakening in the overall denim market, as consumer preference shifts to non-denim bottoms. We have been focusing on designing new products in a variety of fits and washes with new and innovative fabrics to give the customer a reason to purchase a new pair of jeans.\nMore specifically, our wholesale net sales decreased to $66,713,000 from fiscal 2015 from $68,377,000 for fiscal 2014, a two percent decrease. This decrease in our wholesale sales is primarily attributed to a decrease in our domestic men's wholesale and international sales.\nOur retail net sales decreased to $13,486,000 for fiscal 2015 from $15,848,000 for fiscal 2014, a 15 percent decrease, mostly due to lower traffic and the lease expiration for our Melrose store at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and our Northpark store in March 2014. Our Joe's\u00ae retail store sales decreased by $1,957,000 and Hudson's\u00ae e-shop sales decreased by $406,000. Same store sales for our brick and mortar Joe's\u00ae stores decreased by 14 percent. Same store sales for our Hudson\u00ae e-shop decreased by 12 percent.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit decreased to $32,279,000 for fiscal 2015 from $39,723,000 for fiscal 2014, a 19 percent decrease. Our overall gross margin was 40 percent for fiscal 2015 compared to 47 percent for fiscal 2014.\nOur wholesale gross profit decreased to $23,022,000 for fiscal 2015 from $29,006,000 for fiscal 2014, a 21 percent decrease. Our wholesale gross profit decreased for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 due to lower wholesale sales, $3,246,000 of additional inventory write down for finished goods and fabric, and liquidation sales related to aged inventory. Our wholesale gross margin percentage for fiscal 2015 decreased to 35 percent compared to 42 percent for the prior year comparable period. The decrease in gross margin percentage is mostly attributed to additional inventory write down for finished goods and fabric, as we continue to monitor and make adjustments, as necessary, and liquidation sales related to aged inventory.\nOur retail gross profit decreased to $9,257,000 for fiscal 2015 from $10,717,000 for fiscal 2014, a 14 percent decrease. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower store traffic. Our retail gross margin percentage increased to 69 percent in fiscal 2015 compared to 68 percent in fiscal 2014.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense, including Depreciation and Amortization and Impairment of Assets\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses, including, depreciation and amortization and impairment of assets, decreased to $65,568,000 for fiscal 2015 from $70,391,000 for fiscal 2014, a seven percent decrease. Our SG&A expenses were impacted by additional fees of $6,778,000 in connection with investment banking, restructuring and legal advice related to the evaluation of our strategic alternatives in connection with the default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement. Our SG&A includes expenses related to employee and employee related benefits, sales commissions, contingent consideration expense, advertising, sample production, facilities and distribution related costs, professional fees, stock-based compensation, factor and bank fees, fees associated with the evaluation of our strategic alternatives related to the default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement, expenses related to Hudson's operation as our subsidiary and also includes depreciation and amortization and impairment of assets. Our SG&A expenses decreased due to a decrease in impairment charges for fiscal 2015.\nOur wholesale SG&A expense increased to $11,549,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $10,456,000 for fiscal 2014, a 10 percent increase. Our wholesale SG&A expense was higher in fiscal 2015 mostly due to higher samples, tradeshow and bad debt expense.\nOur retail SG&A expense decreased to $12,369,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $12,491,000 for fiscal 2014, a one percent decrease. Our retail SG&A expense decreased mostly due to the costs associated with operating one less store between the end of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, which included a reduction in store payroll, rent and depreciation expense. In fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we recorded a retail store impairment charges of $1,732,000 and $840,000, respectively, related to the property and equipment at our retail stores. Based on the operating performance of these stores, we believed that we could not recover the carrying value of the property and equipment at these stores.\nOur corporate and other SG&A expense decreased to $41,650,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $47,444,000 for fiscal 2014, a 12 percent decrease. Our corporate and other SG&A expense includes general overhead associated with our operations, including Hudson and impairment charges related to our intangible assets. Our decrease in SG&A expenses was attributable to a goodwill impairment charge of $23,585,000 recorded in fiscal 2014 that was partially offset by a trademark impairment charge of $12,400,000 in fiscal 2015. We recorded a trademark impairment charge on our Hudson trademark because the carrying value exceeded its fair market value. We also recorded additional professional fees of $6,778,000 in connection with investment banking, restructuring and legal advice related to strategic alternatives in connection with the default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOperating Loss from Continuing Operations\nWe had an operating loss of $33,289,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $30,668,000 for fiscal 2014. Our increase in operating loss was primarily due to lower wholesale sales and gross profit as discussed above.\nOur wholesale operating income decreased to $11,473,000 for fiscal 2015 from $18,550,000 for fiscal 2014, a 38 percent decrease. We generated a retail operating loss of $3,112,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $1,774,000 for fiscal 2014. Corporate operating loss decreased to $41,650,000 for fiscal 2015 from an operating loss of $47,444,000 for fiscal 2014.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense increased to $6,621,000 for fiscal 2015 from $5,141,000 for fiscal 2014. Our interest expense is primarily associated with interest expense from the Revolving Credit Agreement with CIT, interest expense and PIK interest from the Convertible Notes and amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs associated with the finance arrangements resulting from the Hudson acquisition. Effective retroactively to October 1, 2014, we began paying additional interest to both CIT and the convertible notes, respectively, due to the default under the respective agreements.\nOther Income\nOther income represents the income due to the change in fair value of the embedded conversion derivative from November 30, 2014 to May 31, 2014 of $2,268,000 for the six months ended May 31, 2014.\nIncome Tax\nOur effective tax rate from continuing operations was 6 percent for fiscal 2015 compared to 15 percent for fiscal 2014. The decreased effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 resulted from the adjustments related to the valuation allowance. For fiscal 2015, the valuation allowance associated with deferred\ntaxes as of November 30, 2014, increased by $13,841,000. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in our assessment of the valuation allowance. On September 11, 2015, we completed the Asset Sale which was an asset disposition and resulted in the utilization of certain deferred taxes. We decreased our valuation allowance for these utilized deferred taxes resulting in a net increase of our valuation allowance of $11,620,000. For fiscal 2015, we recorded an income tax expense on discontinued operations of $4,663,000.\nLoss from Continuing Operations\nWe generated a loss from continued operations of $37,356,000 in fiscal 2015 compared to $28,482,000 in fiscal 2014.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nWe generated income from discontinued operations of $5,028,000 in fiscal 2015 compared to $766,000 in fiscal 2014. The increase in income from discontinued operations is primarily attributable to a gain on disposal of Joe's\u00ae trademarks and operating assets as a result of the sale of certain of those assets.\nNet Loss and Comprehensive Loss\nWe generated a net loss of $32,328,000 in fiscal 2015 compared to $27,716,000 in fiscal 2014.\nComparison of Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2014 to Fiscal

from the acquisition date of September 30, 2013 through the end of our fiscal year ended November 30, 2013.\nFiscal Year 2014 Overview\nNet Sales\nOur net sales from continuing operations increased to $84,225,000 in fiscal 2014 from $28,417,000 in fiscal 2013, a 196 percent increase.\nMore specifically, our wholesale net sales from continuing operations increased to $68,377,000 from fiscal 2014 from $15,621,000 for fiscal 2013, a 338 percent increase. This increase in our wholesale sales is attributed to the $52,756,000 in wholesale sales for a full year from Hudson\u00ae.\nOur retail net sales from continuing operations increased to $15,848,000 for fiscal 2014 from $12,796,000 for fiscal 2013, a 24 percent increase. The primary reason for this increase was due to including a full year of retail sales from Hudson's\u00ae e-shop in fiscal 2014 compared to two months in fiscal 2013. Same store sales for Joe's\u00ae stores opened at least 12 months decreased by five percent.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit from continuing operations increased to $39,723,000 for fiscal 2014 from $13,966,000 for fiscal 2013, a 184 percent increase. Our overall gross margin decreased to 47 percent from 49 percent for fiscal 2013.\nOur wholesale gross profit from continuing operations increased to $29,006,000 for fiscal 2014 from $5,227,000 for fiscal 2013, a 455 percent increase. Our wholesale gross profit grew for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to the addition of a full year of sales from Hudson\u00ae. Our wholesale gross margin for fiscal 2014 increased to 42 percent compared to 33 percent for the prior year comparable\nperiod. The increase in gross margin can be mostly attributed to an amortization charge of approximately $2,000,000 in fiscal 2013 and $1,000,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 related to a fair value step up of inventory acquired from Hudson and subsequently sold in fiscal 2014.\nOur retail gross profit from continuing operations increased to $10,717,000 for fiscal 2014 from $8,739,000 for fiscal 2013, a 23 percent increase. This increase is primarily attributable to the additional retail sales from Hudson's\u00ae e-shop that generated an additional $2,176,000 in gross profit for fiscal 2014. We did not open any additional store locations in fiscal 2014. Our retail gross margin percentage was comparable at 68 percent in both periods.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense, including Depreciation and Amortization and Impairment of Assets\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses, including, depreciation and amortization and impairment of assets, from continuing operations increased to $70,391,000 for fiscal 2014 from $23,275,000 for fiscal 2013, a 202 percent increase. Our SG&A expenses increased primarily due to a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge as the carrying value of our Hudson wholesale reporting unit exceeded our fair market value and $25,322,000 of additional expenses related to the operation of our Hudson subsidiary for a full year. Our SG&A includes expenses related to employee and employee related benefits, sales commissions, advertising, sample production, facilities and distribution related costs, professional fees, stock-based compensation, factor and bank fees, impairment of assets, transaction expenses in connection with the Hudson acquisition and also includes depreciation and amortization.\nOur wholesale SG&A expense from continuing operations increased to $10,456,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to $1,527,000 for fiscal 2013, a 585 percent increase. Our wholesale SG&A expense was higher in fiscal 2014 mostly due to the additional SG&A expense associated with a full year of Hudson's operations.\nOur retail SG&A expense from continuing operations increased to $12,491,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to $9,759,000 for fiscal 2013, a 28 percent increase. Our retail SG&A expense increased mostly due to an additional retail expense of $1,407,000 associated with Hudson's e-commerce operations. In fiscal 2014, we recorded a retail store impairment charge of $840,000 related to the property and equipment at six of our retail stores. Based on the operating performance of these stores, we believed that we could not recover the carrying value of the property and equipment at these stores. In addition, fiscal 2014 also includes the full year of operations of four stores opened at various times during fiscal 2013.\nOur corporate and other SG&A expense from continuing operations increased to $47,444,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to $11,989,000 for fiscal 2013, a 296 percent increase. Our corporate and other SG&A expense includes general overhead associated with our operations, including Hudson, and professional fees and other transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of Hudson. Our corporate and other SG&A expense includes a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge for fiscal 2014 as the carrying value of our Hudson wholesale reporting unit exceeded our fair market value. In fiscal 2013, we recorded $4,262,000 of transaction expenses in connection with the acquisition of Hudson that we did not have in fiscal 2014. We also had additional expenses for Hudson's a full year of corporate operations of $14,986,000 in fiscal 2014 that we did not have in fiscal 2013.\nOperating Loss from Continuing Operations\nWe had an operating loss from continuing operations of $30,668,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to $9,309,000 for fiscal 2013. We generated a higher operating loss primarily due to a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge for fiscal 2014.\nDue to the addition of a full year of Hudson's operations, our wholesale operating income increased to $18,550,000 for fiscal 2014 from $3,700,000 for fiscal 2013, a 401 percent increase. As a result of negative same store sales, lower gross margins, higher expenses associated with operating four stores for a full fiscal year and a retail store impairment charge, we generated a retail operating loss of $1,774,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to an operating loss of $1,020,000 for fiscal 2013. Corporate operating loss increased to $47,444,000 for fiscal 2014 from an operating loss of $11,989,000 for fiscal 2013 mostly due to a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge for fiscal 2014.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense from continuing operations increased to $5,141,000 for fiscal 2014 from $1,032,000 for fiscal 2013. Our interest expense is primarily associated with interest expense from our Revolving Credit Agreement with CIT and the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs associated the finance arrangements resulting from the Hudson acquisition in September 2013. We entered into the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement in September 2013, therefore, our interest expense in 2013 only reflects two months of interest under these agreements. Effective retroactively to October 1, 2014, we began paying additional interest to both CIT and Garrison, respectively, due to the default under the respective agreements. We pay to CIT an additional one percent interest and Garrison an additional two percent interest.\nOther Expense\nOther expense from continuing operations mostly represents the change in fair value of the embedded conversion derivative from November 30, 2013 to May 8, 2014, the date of our annual meeting of stockholders approving the conversion of shares under the convertible notes, and this change in value was $2,268,000 for fiscal 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate from continuing operations was 15 percent for fiscal 2014 compared to 30 percent for fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, we had an unfavorable permanent book/tax difference associated with goodwill impairment, which reduced our tax benefit. For fiscal 2013, we had expenses that were not deductible for tax related to the acquisition of Hudson, which reduced our tax benefit.\nLoss from Continuing Operations\nWe generated a loss from continuing operations of $28,482,000 in fiscal 2014 compared to $7,416,000 in fiscal 2013.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nWe generated income from discontinued operations of $766,000 in fiscal 2014 compared to $102,000 in fiscal 2013.\nNet Loss and Comprehensive Loss\nWe generated a net loss of $27,716,000 in fiscal 2014 compared to a net loss of $7,314,000 in fiscal 2013. The increase in our net loss was primarily due to a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge for fiscal 2014, a retail store impairment charge of $840,000 and higher interest expense operating associated with the acquisition of Hudson.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nUntil the acquisition of Hudson on September 30, 2013, our primary sources of liquidity were: (i) cash from sales of our products; (ii) sales from accounts receivable factoring facilities and advances against inventory; and (iii) utilizing existing cash balances. Beginning September 30, 2013, in connection with the acquisition of Hudson, we entered into an amended and restated accounts receivable factoring facility and the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement that provided advances to us for eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory up to $50,000,000, based upon the value of the eligible accounts receivable and inventory less any reserves imposed by CIT. The initial proceeds from the advances under this revolving credit facility, which included accounts receivable and inventory borrowing, were used to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition and fees and expenses associated with the acquisition and the remainder was used to repay our existing factor loans and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. In connection with the Asset Sale, we repaid a portion of our indebtedness under the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and amended the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement pursuant to the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement. The CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, which was amended by Amendment No. 1 on December 29, 2015, provided for a maturity date of February 8, 2016. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of Hudson, we entered into the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement for $60,000,000 with Garrison to finance the remainder of the purchase price required for the acquisition. Under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, we paid interest to Garrison and were required to make prepayments under certain circumstances. The term loan was set to mature on September 30, 2018. We used a portion of the proceeds of the Asset Sale to repay all of our indebtedness outstanding under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement. As a result, the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement was paid in full and terminated on September 11, 2015. On January 28, 2016, all outstanding loans under the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement were repaid and it was terminated in connection with entering into the New Credit Agreements (discussed below). Both the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, along with the Convertible Notes issued in connection with the acquisition of Hudson are discussed in more detail below under \"Financing Arrangements Related to the Acquisition of Hudson.\"\nUnder the amended and restated factoring agreement entered into on September 30, 2013, we sell or assign to CIT certain of our accounts receivable, including accounts arising from or related to sales of inventory and the rendition of services. We pay a factoring rate of 0.50 percent for accounts for which CIT bears the credit risk, subject to discretionary surcharges and 0.35 percent for accounts for which we bear the credit risk, but in no event less than $3.50 per invoice. The interest rate associated with borrowings equals the interest rate then in effect for \"Revolving A Loans\" pursuant to the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement. As of November 30, 2015, that interest rate was approximately 4.83 percent. The amended and restated factoring agreement may be terminated by CIT upon 60 days' written notice or immediately upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the agreement. In connection with the Asset Sale, we also entered into a Reassignment and Termination Agreement, dated as of September 11, 2015 (the \"Reassignment and Termination Agreement\"), pursuant to which Joe's Jeans Subsidiary, Inc. (\"Joe's Sub\") was terminated as a party to the amended and restated factoring agreement and CIT reassigned to Joe's Sub all of its accounts factored with CIT that were outstanding. The amended and restated factoring agreement may be terminated by us upon 60 days' written notice prior to September 30, 2018 or annually with 60 days' written notice prior to September 30th of each year thereafter and remains effective until terminated.\nIn January 2016, the amended and restated factoring agreement was amended, superseded and replaced in its entirety by the Amended and Restated Deferred Purchase Factoring Agreement with CIT, Robert Graham Designs, LLC and Hudson (the \"A&R Factoring Agreement\"). The A&R Factoring Agreement is substantially similar to the amended and restated factoring agreement with the exception of the fees. Under the A&R Factoring Agreement, we pay a factoring rate of (i) 0.20 percent for\ncertain major department store accounts, (ii) 0.40 percent for all other accounts for which CIT bears the credit risk, subject to discretionary surcharges, and (iii) 0.35 percent for accounts for which we bear the credit risk, but in no event less than $3.50 per invoice. The A&R Factoring Agreement may be terminated by CIT upon 60 days' written notice or immediately upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the agreement. The A&R Factoring Agreement may be terminated by us upon 60 days' written notice prior to December 31, 2020 or annually with 60 days' written notice prior to December 31st of each year thereafter.\nFor the fiscal year ended 2015, we generated $8,599,000 of cash flow from operations mostly from the collection of receivables and liquidation of aged inventory. Cash flow used in financing activities consisted of $27,756,000 of repayments under our revolving credit facility and $59,925,000 of repayments under our term loan. We made payments of $86,000 for taxes on restricted stock units and we purchased $117,000 in restricted stock. We received $80,000,000 from the sale of the Joe's\u00ae Business We used $485,000 in investing activities for the purchase of property and equipment. Our cash balance increased to $1,937,000 as of November 30, 2015.\nAs of November 30, 2015, our cash balance was $1,937,000 and our borrowing base cash availability with CIT was approximately $3,163,000. As of November 30, 2014, our cash balance was $1,054,000 and our cash availability with CIT was approximately $12,000,000. This amount with CIT fluctuates on a daily basis based upon invoicing and collection related activity by CIT on our behalf. As of November 30, 2015, our revolving credit facility had a balance of $4,235,000. As of November 30, 2014, our revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of $31,338,000.\nFor fiscal 2016, our primary capital needs are for: (i) operating expenses; (ii) payments, including interest required to be made under our New Credit Agreements and Modified Convertible Notes; (iii) working capital necessary to fund inventory purchases; (iv) integration and other costs associated with the Merger; (v) financing extensions of trade credit to our customers; (vi) payments for expenses associated with the Merger and the Merger Transactions. We anticipate funding our operations through working capital generated by the following: (i) cash flow from sales of our products from the combined companies; (ii) managing our operating expenses and inventory levels; (iii) maximizing trade payables with our domestic and international suppliers; (iv) increasing collection efforts on existing accounts receivables; and (v) utilizing proceeds from our New Credit Agreements.\nBased on our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and the expected borrowing availability under the New Credit Agreements and the A&R Factoring Agreement based upon our borrowing base and sales forecasts, we believe that we have the working capital resources necessary to meet our projected operational needs for fiscal 2016. However, if we require more capital for growth and integration or if we experience a decline in sales and/or operating losses, we believe that it will be necessary to obtain additional working capital through additional credit arrangements.\nWe believe that the rate of inflation over the past few years has not had a significant adverse impact on our net sales or income from continuing operations.\nFinancing Arrangements Related to the Acquisition of Hudson, the Merger and the Merger Transactions\nConvertible Notes\nWe issued Convertible Notes in connection with the acquisition of Hudson with different interest rates and conversion features for Hudson's management stockholders and Fireman, respectively. Interest on the Convertible Notes was paid in a combination of cash and additional paid-in-kind notes, or PIK notes. All of the Convertible Notes were structurally and contractually subordinated to our senior debt and matured on March 31, 2019. All of the notes were expressly junior and subordinated in right of payment to all amounts due and owing upon any indebtedness outstanding under the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement (as discussed below). Due\nto the defaults and events of default under the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, we were prohibited from making any payments under the Convertible Notes.\nOn September 8, 2015, we entered into the Rollover Agreement with the holders of our Convertible Notes, pursuant to which, on January 28, 2016, the holders of the Convertible Notes contributed to us the Convertible Notes in exchange for the following:\n\u2022 1,167,317 shares of Common Stock;\n\u2022 a cash payment of approximately $8.6 million, before expenses; and\n\u2022 an aggregate principal amount of approximately $16.5 million of Modified Convertible Notes.\nThe Modified Convertible Notes are structurally and contractually subordinated to our senior debt and will mature on July 28, 2021. The Modified Convertible Notes accrue interest quarterly on the outstanding principal amount at a rate of 6.5% per annum (to be increased to 7% as of October 1, 2016 with respect to the Modified Convertible notes issued to Fireman), which will be payable 50% in cash and 50% in additional notes; provided, however, that we may, in our sole discretion, elect to pay 100% of such interest in cash. Beginning on January 28, 2016, the Modified Convertible Notes were convertible by each of the holders into shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election.\nIf we elect to issue only shares of common stock upon conversion of the Modified Convertible Notes, each of the Modified Convertible Notes would be convertible, in whole but not in part, into a number of shares equal to the conversion amount divided by the market price. The conversion amount is (a) the product of (i) the market price, multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (A) the principal amount, divided by (B) the conversion price, minus (b) the aggregate optional prepayment amounts paid to the holder. The market price is the average of the closing prices for our common stock over the 20 trading day period immediately preceding the notice of conversion. If we elect to pay cash with respect to a conversion of the Modified Convertible Notes, the amount of cash to be paid per share will be equal to the conversion amount. We will have the right to prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of the Modified Convertible Notes at any time so long as it makes a pro rata prepayment on all of the Modified Convertible Notes.\nCIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement\nIn connection with the acquisition of Hudson, we entered into a CIT Revolving Credit Agreement that provided us with a revolving credit facility up to $50,000,000 comprised of a revolving A-1 commitment of up to $1,000,000 and a revolving A commitment of up to $50,000,000 minus the revolving A-1 commitment. Our actual maximum credit availability under the revolving facility varied from time to time and was determined by calculating a borrowing base, which was based on the value of the eligible accounts and eligible inventory minus reserves imposed by CIT. The revolving facility also provided for swingline loans, up to $5,000,000 sublimit, and letters of credit, up to $1,000,000 sublimit. Proceeds from advances under the revolving facility were to be used for working capital needs and general corporate purposes and were initially used to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition and fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of Hudson and to repay our existing factor loans.\nUntil we entered into a forbearance agreement and amendments to the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement in June 2015, we were not in compliance with the covenants under the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement as a result of events of default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with the Asset Sale, a portion of our indebtedness under the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement was repaid, and on September 11, 2015, we entered into the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, which was further amended on December 29, 2015. Among other things, the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (i) amended and restated the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement as it had been amended from time to time and (ii) waived the \"Existing Defaults\" and \"Forbearance Defaults\" (each as defined under the CIT Forbearance Agreement) and certain other defaults. Pursuant to a separate consent and agreement, CIT and the lenders consented to the Asset Sale.\nThe CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement provided for a revolving facility (the \"CIT Revolving Facility\") with a revolving commitment of up to $10,000,000 (the \"CIT Revolving Commitment\"). Our actual maximum credit availability under the CIT Revolving Facility varied from time to time and was equal to the lesser of (i) the CIT Revolving Commitment minus an availability block of $2.5 million, or $7.5 million, and (ii) a calculated borrowing base, which was based on the value of the eligible accounts and eligible inventory minus the availability block of $2.5 million minus reserves imposed by the revolving lenders, all as were specified in the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement. The CIT Revolving Facility provided for swingline loans, up to $1 million sublimit, and letters of credit, up to $1 million sublimit, within such credit availability limits. Proceeds from advances under the CIT Revolving Facility were to be used (i) to pay fees and expenses in connection with the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement and the Asset Sale and (ii) for working capital needs and general corporate purposes.\nAll unpaid loans under the CIT Revolving Facility were to mature on February 8, 2016. We had the right at any time and from time to time to (i) terminate the commitments under the CIT Revolving Facility in full and (ii) prepay any borrowings under the CIT Revolving Facility, in whole or in part, without terminating or reducing the commitment under the CIT Revolving Facility.\nThe CIT Revolving Facility was guaranteed by us and all of our subsidiaries, and secured by liens on substantially all of our assets. Advances under the CIT Revolving Facility were in the form of either base rate loans or LIBOR rate loans. The interest rate for base rate loans under the CIT Revolving Commitment fluctuated and were equal to (x) the greatest (the \"Alternate Base Rate\") of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank prime rate; (b) the Federal funds rate plus 0.50%; and (c) the rate per annum equal to the 90 day LIBOR published in the New York City edition of the Wall Street Journal under \"Money Rates\" (the \"90-Day LIBO Rate\") plus 1.0%, in each case, plus (y) 3.50%. The interest rate for LIBOR rate loans under the CIT Revolving Commitment was equal to the 90-Day LIBO Rate per annum plus 4.50%. Interest on the CIT Revolving Facility was payable on the first day of each calendar month and the maturity date. Among other fees, we were required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% per annum (due quarterly) on the average daily amount of the unused revolving commitment under the CIT Revolving Facility. We also were required to pay fees with respect to any letters of credit issued under the CIT Revolving Facility.\nThe CIT Revolving Facility contained usual and customary negative covenants for transactions of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our and our subsidiaries' ability, to create or incur indebtedness; create liens; consolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve; sell, lease or otherwise transfer any of its assets (with the Asset Sale expressly permitted); substantially change the nature of our business; make investments or acquisitions; pay dividends; enter into transactions with affiliates; amend material documents, prepay certain indebtedness and make capital expenditures. The negative covenants were subject to certain exceptions as specified in the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement.\nAdditionally, in connection with the Asset Sale, Joe's Sub, Hudson, the Operating Assets Purchaser and CIT entered into the Reassignment and Termination Agreement, pursuant to which, Joe's Sub was terminated as a party to the amended and restated factoring agreement. Subject to the terms and\nconditions provided in the Reassignment and Termination Agreement, CIT reassigned to Joe's Sub all of its accounts factored with CIT which were outstanding as of the date of the Reassignment and Termination Agreement.\nOn January 28, 2016, all outstanding loans under the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement were repaid and it was terminated in connection with entering into the New Credit Agreements (discussed below).\nGarrison Term Loan Credit Agreement\nOur indebtedness outstanding under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement was fully repaid with a portion of the proceeds of the Asset Sale. As a result, the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement was terminated on September 11, 2015. The Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement provided for term loans of up to $60,000,000 and was fully funded to us as of September 30, 2013. The term loan proceeds were used to finance a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Hudson and to pay fees and expenses associated with the acquisition.\nThe term loan was to mature on September 30, 2018. We were allowed to prepay the term loan at any time, in whole or in part, subject to the payment of a prepayment fee if we prepay prior to September 30, 2016. The prepayment fee was two percent at the time we repaid the term loan. In addition, while the term loan was outstanding, we were required to make prepayments out of extraordinary receipts, certain percentage of the excess cash flow and certain net proceeds of certain asset sales or equity issuances, in each case (other than a prepayment in connection with excess cash flow), subject to the payment of the prepayment fee.\nThe term loan facility was guaranteed by us and all of our subsidiaries, and was secured by liens on substantially all assets owned by us, including a first- priority lien on intellectual property owned by us and a second-priority lien on the revolving credit priority collateral.\nThe interest rate for the term loan fluctuated and was equal to the rate per annum equal to the British Banker Association Interest Settlement Rate for deposits in Dollars with a term of three months, as appears on the Bloomberg BBAM Screen, plus 10.75 percent. Interest was payable on the first day of each calendar month and the maturity date. In addition, because we were in default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, we were paying an additional two percent interest under the default rate. Our average interest rate, including the default rate, was approximately 14 percent.\nThe Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement contained usual and customary negative covenants for transactions of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability and our subsidiaries' ability to create or incur indebtedness; create liens; consolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve; sell, lease or otherwise transfer any of its assets; substantially change the nature of its business; make investments or acquisitions; pay dividends; enter into transactions with affiliates; amend material documents, prepay certain indebtedness and make capital expenditures. The negative covenants were subject to certain exceptions as specified in the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement also required us to maintain certain financial covenants. Until we entered into a forbearance agreement and amendments to the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement in June 2015, we were not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nNew Credit Agreements\nOn January 28, 2016 (the \"Closing Date\"), we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into (i) a new credit and security agreement (the \"ABL Credit Agreement\") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as lender, and (ii) a new credit and security agreement with TCW Asset Management Company, as agent, and the lenders party thereto (the \"Term Credit Agreement\", and together with the\nABL Credit Agreement, the \"New Credit Agreements\"). In connection with entering into the New Credit Agreements, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Facility\") with commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $40 million. The Term Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan credit facility (the \"Term Facility\", and together with the Revolving Facility, the \"Facilities\") in an aggregate principal amount of $50 million. The Term Facility matures on January 28, 2021. The Revolving Facility matures on October 30, 2020. The amount available to be drawn under the Revolving Facility will be based on the borrowing base values attributed to eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory.\nCertain of our domestic subsidiaries are co-borrowers under the New Credit Agreements. The obligations under the New Credit Agreements are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our assets, including the assets of our domestic subsidiaries.\nThere are no scheduled payments under the Revolving Facility. The Term Facility will be subject to quarterly payments of principal as follows: (i) 0.25% for each of the first four fiscal quarters, (ii) 0.625% for each of the four fiscal quarters thereafter, (iii) 1.25% for each of the next following four fiscal quarters, (iv) 1.875% for each of the next following four fiscal quarters, and (v) 2.50% for each fiscal quarter thereafter, with the balance payable at maturity.\nThe Term Facility includes mandatory prepayments customary for credit facilities of its nature, including, subject to certain exceptions: (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds from issuances of debt that is not permitted and certain equity issuances; (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds from certain non-ordinary course asset sales, subject to customary exceptions and reinvestment rights; (iii) 100% of certain insurance proceeds and condemnation recoveries, subject to customary exceptions and reinvestment rights; (iv) 100% of the net cash proceeds from certain extraordinary receipts; and (v) a variable percentage of excess cash flow, ranging from 50% to 0% depending on our senior leverage ratio. Outstanding loans under the Term Facility may be prepaid at any time at our option subject to customary \"breakage\" costs with respect to LIBO rate loans. Subject to certain exceptions, prepayments of loans under the Term Facility are subject to a prepayment premium of (i) 2.00% during the first year after the closing date and (ii) 1.00% during the second year after the closing date. The Revolving Facility is required to be prepaid to the extent extensions of credit thereunder exceed the applicable borrowing base. Outstanding loans under the Revolving Facility may be prepaid at any time at our option without premium or penalty, other than customary \"breakage\" costs with respect to LIBO rate loans.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement provides that, subject to customary conditions, we and certain of our subsidiaries that are borrowers may seek to obtain incremental commitments under the Revolving Facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed $10 million. The Term Credit Agreement provides that, subject to customary conditions, we and certain of our subsidiaries that are borrowers may seek to obtain incremental term loans under the Term Facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed $50 million. We do not currently have any commitments for such incremental loans under either Facility.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreements will bear interest at a rate equal to either, at our option, an adjusted base rate or the LIBO rate (subject to a 0.50% floor for borrowings under the Term Facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins for borrowing under the Term Facility (which varies based on our senior leverage ratio) range from 6.00% to 7.50% for base rate loans and 7.00% to 8.50% for LIBO rate loans. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Revolving Facility is 0.25% for base rate loans and 1.50% for LIBO rate loans. An unused commitment fee equal to 0.25% per annum of the average daily amount by which the total commitments under the\nRevolving Facility exceeds the outstanding usage under the Revolving Facility will be payable monthly in arrears.\nThe New Credit Agreements contain customary representations and warranties, events of default and covenants, including, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, covenants that restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, dispose of assets, make prepayments of certain indebtedness, pay certain dividends and other restricted payments, make investments, and engage in transactions with affiliates. The Term Credit Agreement requires us to comply with financial maintenance covenants to be tested quarterly (beginning with the second fiscal quarter ending after the closing date), consisting of a maximum senior leverage ratio, a maximum net senior rent adjusted leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The ABL Credit Agreement requires us to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio to be tested monthly if excess availability under the Revolving Facility is less than 10% of the lesser of the commitments under the Revolving Facility and the borrowing base or during specified events of defaults. If an event of default under one of the Credit Agreements occurs and continues, the commitments may be terminated and the principal amount outstanding thereunder, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owed, may be declared immediately due and payable.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nManagement's Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies\nWe believe that the accounting policies discussed below are important to an understanding of our financial statements because they require management to exercise judgment and estimate the effects of uncertain matters in the preparation and reporting of financial results. Accordingly, we caution that these policies and the judgments and estimates they involve are subject to revision and adjustment in the future. While they involve less judgment, management believes that the other accounting policies discussed in \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" included in this Annual Report are also important to an understanding of our financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWholesale revenues are recorded on the accrual basis of accounting when title transfers to the customer, which is typically at the shipping point. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs, including co-op advertising, other advertising programs or allowances, based upon a percentage of sales. We also allow for returns based upon pre-approval or in the case of damaged goods. Such returns are estimated based on historical experience and an allowance is provided at the time of sale.\nRetail store revenue is recognized net of estimated returns at the time of sale to consumers. E-commerce sales of products ordered through our retail internet site known as www.joesjeans.com are recognized upon estimated delivery and receipt of the shipment by the customers. E-commerce revenue is also reduced by an estimate of returns. Retail store revenue and E-commerce revenue exclude sales taxes. Revenue from licensing arrangements are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements, generally based upon the higher of (a) contractually guaranteed minimum royalty levels and (b) estimates of sales and royalty data received from our licensees. Payments received in consideration of the grant of a license or advanced royalty payments are recognized ratably as revenue over the term of the license agreement. The revenue recognized ratably\nover the term of the license agreement will not exceed royalty payments received. The unrecognized portion of the upfront payments are included in deferred royalties and accrued expenses depending on the long or short term nature of the payments to be recognized. As of November 30, 2015 and November 30, 2014, we have recognized all of the advanced payments under our licensing agreements as income.\nFactored Accounts and Receivables, Allowance for Customer Credits and Doubtful Allowances\nWe evaluate our ability to collect on accounts receivable and charge-backs (disputes from the customer) based upon a combination of factors. Whether a receivable is past due is based on how recently payments have been received and in certain circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit sources). A specific reserve for bad debts is taken against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. Amounts are charged off against the reserve once it is established that amounts are not likely to be collected. We recognize reserves for charge-backs based on our historical collection experience.\nThe balance in the allowance for customer credits and doubtful accounts as of November 30, 2015 and November 30, 2014 was $966,000 and $844,000 respectively, for non-factored accounts receivables.\nInventory\nWe continually evaluate the composition of our inventories by assessing slow-turning, ongoing product as well as product from prior seasons. Market value of distressed inventory is valued based on historical sales trends on our individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory. Significant changes in market values could cause us to record additional inventory markdowns.\nValuation of Long-lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nWe assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review other than on an annual basis include the following:\n\u2022 A significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;\n\u2022 A significant change in the manner of the use of the acquired asset or the strategy for the overall business; or\n\u2022 A significant negative industry or economic trend.\nWhen we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the aforementioned factors and the carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management. These cash flows are calculated by netting future estimated sales against associated merchandise costs and other related expenses such as payroll, occupancy and marketing. An asset is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the asset's ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value, which is determined based on discounted future cash flows. The impairment loss calculations\nrequire management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and the discount rates that reflect the risk inherent in future cash flows. Future expected cash flows for store assets are based on management's estimates of future cash flows over the remaining lease period or expected life, if shorter. We consider historical trends, expected future business trends and other factors when estimating each store's future cash flow. We also consider factors such as: the local environment for each store location, including mall traffic and competition; our ability to successfully implement strategic initiatives; and the ability to control variable costs such as cost of sales and payroll, and in some cases, renegotiate lease costs.\nIn fiscal 2015, we recorded store impairment charge of $1,732,000 related to our retail stores. Based on the operating performance of these stores, we believed that we could not recover the carrying value of property and equipment located at these stores.\nBusiness acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable for impairment.\nIn fiscal 2007, we acquired through merger JD Holdings, which included all of the goodwill and intangible assets goodwill related to the Joe's\u00ae, Joe's Jeans\u2122 and JD\u00ae logo and marks. On September 30, 2013, we acquired Hudson, which included all of the goodwill and intangible assets related to the Hudson\u00ae logos and marks. We have assigned an indefinite life to the remaining intangible assets relating to the trademarks acquired, and therefore, no amortization expenses are expected to be recognized. However, we will test the assets for impairment annually in accordance with our critical accounting policies. On September 11, 2015, we sold the Joe's\u00ae, Joe's Jeans\u2122 and JD\u00ae logo and marks in connection with the Asset Sale.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable using a two-step process. The first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare this value to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss would be recognized. The second step is performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets. The implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the goodwill.\nWe review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or when circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. We calculate the value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow method, based on the relief from royalty concept.\nOur annual impairment testing date is September 30 of each year or when circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. As part of our annual testing for fiscal 2015, we determined that the carrying value of our Hudson trademark may not be recoverable and therefore, we impaired the Hudson trademark by $12,400,000. We determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill.\nFor fiscal 2014, based on our under-performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we determined that it was appropriate to perform an impairment testing as of November 30, 2014. Based on our testing, we determined that the goodwill allocated to our Hudson wholesale reporting unit was impaired by $23,585,000, and there was no impairment of our other indefinite-lived intangible assets. As of February 28, 2015, we also determined that a triggering event had occurred due to the decline in\nour market capitalization and tested our goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets for impairment and determined that there was no impairment.\nAdditional Merger Consideration\nIn connection with the merger with JD Holdings, we agreed to pay to Mr. Dahan certain contingent consideration payments in the applicable fiscal year for 120 months following October 25, 2007. The additional merger consideration, or contingent consideration, was paid in advance on a monthly basis based upon estimates of gross profits after the assumption that the payments were likely to be paid. At the end of each quarter, any overpayments were offset against future payments and any significant underpayments were made.\nUnder the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, accounting for consideration transferred to settle a contingency based on earnings or other performance measures, certain criteria is used to determine whether contingent consideration based on earnings or other performance measures should be accounted for as (1) adjustment of the purchase price of the acquired enterprise or (2) compensation for services, use of property or profit sharing. The determination of how to account for the contingent consideration is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. The advanced contingent consideration payments are accounted for as operating expense.\nOn February 18, 2013, we entered into a new agreement with Mr. Dahan that provided certainty of payments to him by removing the contingencies related to the contingent consideration payments described above. This agreement fixed the overall amount to be paid by us for the remaining months of year six through year 10 with payments being made over an accelerated time period until November 2015 instead of October 2017. Under the agreement, the total aggregate amount Mr. Dahan is entitled to receive is $9,168,000. We recorded a one-time charge as an expense for the full amount in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. As a result of our defaults under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and CIT Revolving Credit Agreement, we did not make any buy-out payments to Mr. Dahan during fiscal 2015. In connection with the Asset Sale, Mr. Dahan was repaid a portion of the buy-out payment owed to him and the remainder was paid at the closing of the Merger and the Merger Transactions.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes. These timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. Management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. Reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal and state issues that are currently unresolved. We routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations.\nContingencies\nWe record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires management to use judgment. Many of these legal and tax contingencies can take years to be resolved. Generally, as\nthe time period increases over which the uncertainties are resolved, the likelihood of changes to the estimate of the ultimate outcome increases. Management believes that the accruals for these matters are adequate. Should events or circumstances change, we could have to record additional accruals.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the ASC standards. We elected the modified prospective method where prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock based compensation is measured at grant date based upon the fair value of the award and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, which requires management to use estimates and assumptions. The determination of the fair value of stock based option awards on the date of grant is based upon the exercise price as well as assumptions regarding subjective variables. These variables include our expected life of the option, expected stock price volatility over the term of the award, determination of a risk free interest rate and an estimated dividend yield. We estimate the expected life of the option by calculating the average term based upon historical experience. We estimate the expected stock price volatility by using implied volatility in market traded stock over the same period as the vesting period. We base the risk-free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from United States Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the term on the options. We do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero. If factors change or we employ different assumptions for estimating fair value of the stock option, our estimates may be different than future estimates or actual values realized upon the exercise, expiration, early termination or forfeiture of those awards in the future. At this time, we believe that our current method for accounting for stock based compensation is reasonable. Furthermore, an entity may elect either an accelerated recognition method or a straight-line recognition method for awards subject to graded vesting based on a service condition, regardless of how the fair value of the award is measured. For all stock based compensation awards that contain graded vesting based on service conditions, we have elected to apply a straight-line recognition method to account for these awards. However, guidance is relatively new and the application of these principles over time may be subject to further interpretation or refinement. See \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Stock-Based Compensation\" and \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 11-Stockholders' Equity-Stock Incentive Plans\" for additional discussion.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn accordance with the provisions of ASC 205-20, the results of operations of a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale is required to be reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. In order to be considered a discontinued operation, both the operations and cash flows of the component have been (or will be) eliminated from the ongoing operations of an entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction. The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations and financial position of our Joe's Business as discontinued operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property Plant and Equipment (Topic 360), Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, (\"ASU 2014-08\") which provides amended guidance on the presentation of financial statements and reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity within property, plant and equipment. ASU 2014-08 amends the definition\nof a discontinued operation and requires entities to disclose additional information about disposal transactions that do not meet the discontinued operations criteria. The effective date of ASU 2014-08 is for disposals that occur in annual periods (and interim periods therein) beginning on or after December 15, 2014. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (\"ASU 2014-09\"), which provides a single, comprehensive framework for all entities in all industries to apply in the determination of when to recognize revenue, and, therefore, supersedes virtually all existing revenue recognition requirements and guidance. This framework is expected to result in less complex guidance in application while providing a consistent and comparable methodology for revenue recognition. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should apply the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract(s), (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s), and (v) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We are currently evaluating the impact that this amended guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In July 2015, the FASB reached a decision to defer the effective date of the amended guidance. In August 2015, ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, was issued which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 to communicate amendments to FASB Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 205-40, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (the \"ASC amendments\"). The ASC amendments establish new requirements for management to evaluate a company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide certain related disclosures. The ASC amendments are effective for the annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted, but we have not yet adopted such guidance.\nIn July 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330)-Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which will require an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The guidance will be effective for us beginning with fiscal year 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (\"ASU 2015-17\") which will require entities to present deferred tax assets (\"DTAs\") and deferred tax liabilities (\"DTLs\") as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 simplifies the current guidance, which requires entities to separately present DTAs and DTLs as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2015-17 are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. ASU 2015-17 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2017. Adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.", "summary": "- The provided table represents the population of

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIntroduction\nThis discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and financial conditions during the fiscal years ended November 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental information in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered forward-looking. These statements contain a number of risks and uncertainties, as discussed under the heading \"Forward-Looking Statements\" of this Annual Report that could cause actual results to differ materially. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Our future results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nWe completed the acquisition of Hudson on September 30, 2013 and the information presented includes the results of operations of Hudson from that date through the end of our fiscal year of November 30, 2013, which was approximately two months of operations, and its financial results are included in each of the two reportable segments in a manner consistent with our reporting structure. Therefore, our results of operations for the fiscal year 2013 are not necessarily indicative of future results. Our financial results for fiscal 2015 and 2014 reflect a full year of operations for our Hudson subsidiary.\nWe completed the sale of certain of our operating and intellectual property assets related to the Joe's Business to two separate purchasers for an aggregate purchase price of $80 million in September 2015, and, as a result, sales of our Joe's\u00ae products are presented as held for sale (discontinued operations) in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. As part of the Asset Sale, we entered into the IP Asset Purchase Agreement with the IP Assets Purchaser and, solely for the purposes of its related guarantee, Sequential Brands Group, Inc., pursuant to which, the IP Assets Purchaser, among other things, purchased the Intellectual Property Assets used or held for use in the Joe's Business. The aggregate purchase price was $67 million. Simultaneous with the IP Asset Purchase Agreement, we entered into the Operating Asset Purchase Agreement with the Operating Assets Purchaser, pursuant to which the Operating Assets Purchaser, among other things, purchased certain inventory and other assets and assumed certain liabilities from us and our subsidiaries related to the Joe's Business, including certain employees of the Joe's Business and, at a later date, specified Joe's store leases. The aggregate purchase price was $13 million. At the closing of the sale, both the IP Assets Purchaser and the Operating Assets Purchaser deposited an aggregate of $4.0 million into an escrow account, which will be used to defer certain costs and expenses which may be incurred by us after the closing of the transaction.\nExecutive Overview and Subsequent Events\nOur principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing of apparel products, which include denim jeans, related casual wear and accessories that bear the brand Hudson\u00ae. Historically, until September 2015, we also had apparel products bearing the Joe's\u00ae brand. Joe's\u00ae was established in 2001 and the brand is recognized in the premium denim industry, an industry term for denim jeans with price points generally of $120 or more, for its quality, fit and fashion-forward designs.\nAs a result of the Asset Sale, sales of our Joe's\u00ae products are presented as held for sale (discontinued operations) in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Hudson\u00ae was established in 2002, and is similarly recognized as a premier designer and marketer of women's and men's premium branded denim apparel. Because we focus on design, development and marketing, we rely on third parties to manufacture our apparel products. We sell our products through our own retail stores, our websites and to numerous retailers, which include major department stores, specialty stores and distributors around the world.\nOn September 30, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Hudson for an aggregate purchase price consisting of approximately $65,416,000 in cash and approximately $27,451,000 in convertible notes, net of discount. This acquisition provided us with an additional proven premium denim brand and enhanced our prospects for growth across wholesale, retail and e-commerce, both domestically and overseas, and created the potential for improved purchasing authority with current and future vendors and other operational efficiencies. As of September 30, 2013, the acquired business represented approximately 40 percent of our consolidated total assets at November 30, 2013 and approximately three percent of consolidated net loss for the year ended November 30, 2013.\nDuring fiscal 2014 and 2015, we believed that our growth potential relied on the integration of the Hudson and Joe's Jeans operations. We did not achieve the desired level of integration on our original timetable. As a result, we failed to meet certain financial covenants set forth in the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement. On November 6, 2014, we received a notice of default and demand for payment of default interest from Garrison, as term loan agent, under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement. As a result of the default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, we were also in default under the terms of our CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and our factoring facility with CIT and we were prohibited from making payments under the Convertible Notes and the obligations to Mr. Dahan.\nAdditionally, during the first half of fiscal 2015, our business was also impacted by a decrease in overall sales in both our wholesale and retail segments. During fiscal 2014, our business was impacted by a decline in our overall Joe's\u00ae business, but offset by the addition of sales from the acquisition of Hudson. On a comparative basis, sales of our men's and women's denim bottoms were, and continue to be, impacted by a weakening in the overall denim market, as consumer preference shifts to non-denim bottoms. Both brands have been focused on designing new products in a variety of fits and washes with new and innovative fabrics to give the customer a reason to purchase a new pair of jeans. Beginning in fiscal 2012, we also offered a line, else\u2122, that had price points starting at $68 and was created to reach young women who are looking for a premium denim-like product at a more affordable price. As of fiscal 2014, we began to re-evaluate this brand and significant decreases in sales related to this brand impacted our comparative sales for fiscal 2014. We sold the else\u2122 trademark pursuant to the Asset Sale and at the time of the sale, the else\u2122 brand had very limited assets and distribution in the international market.\nOn January 19, 2015, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Marc. B. Crossman, resigned. As a result of the defaults and the resignation of our CEO, our Board determined that it was in the best interests of the company and our stockholders to explore all of strategic alternatives to remedy the defaults with our lenders and to find a new CEO to lead us. On January 29, 2015, we engaged Carl Marks Advisory Group Inc. (\"Carl Marks\") to help us explore all of our alternatives to resolve our financial condition. In March 2015, Carl Marks launched its strategic transaction process seeking proposals for transactions that would generate enough funds that would allow the Company to repay the term loan in full. The indications of interest were for a wide variety of transactions including a partial refinancing, IP sale/license transaction, asset sale transaction and a merger/recapitalization transaction. As part of the process, on September 8, 2015, we entered into various definitive agreements intended to provide a total solution to resolving the Company's operational, financial and management issues, pursuant to which we agreed to (i) the Asset Sale, which was completed\nSeptember 11, 2015, whereby we sold certain of our operating and intellectual property assets related to the Joe's Business for a total of $80 million, (ii) combine our remaining business operated under the Hudson brand with RG pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (iii) issue and sell $50 million of our Series A Preferred Stock in a private placement to an affiliate of TCP pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, (iv) exchange our outstanding Convertible Notes for a combination of cash, shares of our common stock and the Modified Convertible Notes and (v) gain a CEO with public company experience. On September 11, 2015, the proceeds of the Asset Sale were used to repay all of our indebtedness outstanding under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and a portion of our indebtedness outstanding under our Revolving Credit Agreement. As a result, the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement was paid in full and terminated on September 11, 2015 and we entered in the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with CIT, which provided for a maximum credit availability of $7.5 million and waived certain defaults. On January 28, 2016, all outstanding loans under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement were repaid and it was terminated in connection with entering into (i) a new credit and security agreement (the \"ABL Credit Agreement\") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as lender, and (ii) a new credit and security agreement with TCW Asset Management Company, as agent, and the lenders party thereto (the \"Term Credit Agreement\", and together with the ABL Credit Agreement, the \"New Credit Agreements\"). On January 28, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of RG, as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 8, 2015 (the \"Merger Agreement\"), by and among RG, Merger Sub and us, for an aggregate of $81.0 million in cash and 8,870,968 shares of our common stock (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split (as defined below)). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub was merged with and into RG, so that RG, as the surviving entity, became our wholly-owned subsidiary. RG is engaged in the design, development, sales and licensing of apparel products and accessories that bear the brand name Robert Graham\u00ae.\nEffective upon consummation of the Merger, we changed our name to Differential Brands Group Inc. and effected a reverse stock split (the \"Reverse Stock Split\") of our issued and outstanding common stock such that each thirty shares of our issued and outstanding common stock was reclassified into one share of our issued and outstanding common stock. The Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value or the amount of authorized shares of our common stock. The primary purpose of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the per-share market price of our common stock in order to maintain our listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market maintained by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"NASDAQ\").\nIn connection with the Merger, on January 28, 2016, we completed issuance and sale of an aggregate of fifty thousand (50,000) shares of our preferred stock, designated as \"Series A Convertible Preferred Stock\" (the \"Series A Preferred Stock\"), for an aggregate purchase price of $50 million in cash, as contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, dated as of September 8, 2015 (the \"Stock Purchase Agreement\"), by and between us and TCP Denim, LLC (the \"Series A Purchaser\").\nWe used the proceeds from the Stock Purchase Agreement and the debt financing provided by the credit facilities under the New Credit Agreements to, among other things, consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nAlso in connection with the completion of Merger, on January 28, 2016, we completed the exchange of our outstanding convertible notes for (i) 1,167,317 shares of common stock (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split); (ii) a cash payment of approximately $8.6 million; and (iii) an aggregate principal amount of approximately $16.5 million of modified convertible notes (the \"Modified Convertible Notes\"), as contemplated by the rollover agreement, dated September 8, 2015 (the \"Rollover Agreement\"), between us and the holders of our convertible notes.\nOur Joe's\u00ae product line, which was sold pursuant to the Asset Sale, included women's and men's denim jeans, pants, shirts, sweaters, jackets and other apparel products. We also offered under our\nJoe's\u00ae brand women's handbags and clutches, women's intimates, children's products, shoes, belts and leather goods produced by us or under various license agreements and we received royalty payments based upon net sales from licensees. Our Hudson\u00ae product line includes women's, men's and children's denim jeans, pants, jackets and other bottoms. Similar to the evolution of Joe's\u00ae, we continue to evaluate offering a range of products under the Hudson\u00ae brand name.\nOur Robert Graham\u00ae product line includes premium priced men's sport shirts, denim jeans, pants, shorts, sweaters, knits, t-shirts, sportcoats, outerwear, and swimwear. RG also offers a line of women's apparel, mainly in its own retail stores. Additionally, men's shoes, belts, small leather goods, dress shirts, neckwear, tailored clothing, headwear, eye and sun glasses, jewelry, hosiery, underwear, loungewear and fragrances are produced by third parties under various license agreements and RG receives royalty payments based upon net sales from licensees.\nAfter the closing of the Operating Asset Purchase Agreement and the IP Asset Purchase Agreement, we retained and operated 32 Joe's\u00ae brand retail stores. Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Asset Purchase Agreement, we transferred 18 retail stores to the Operating Assets Purchaser on January 28, 2016 for no additional consideration. As of February 29, 2016, the remaining 14 Joe's\u00ae brand retail stores were closed. The retail stores being transferred have been included as part of our discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report. The Operating Assets Purchaser supplies Joe's\u00ae branded merchandise to the retail stores for resale under a license from the IP Assets Purchaser. As of February 29, 2016 we had 30 Robert Graham\u00ae brand stores, which consisted of 18 full price stores and 12 outlet stores. Two additional leases for Robert Graham\u00ae brand full price stores have been signed for 2016 openings.\nFor 2016, we believe that our growth drivers will be dependent upon the successful integration of the Hudson Business and the Robert Graham Business as a result of the Merger, which includes reducing expenses and achieving synergies that we expect as a result of the Merger. Other growth drivers include cost saving measures related to the operation of our Hudson Business and the performance of each of our Hudson Business and our Robert Graham Business.\nOur business is seasonal. The majority of the marketing and sales orders take place from late fall to late spring. The greatest volume of shipments and actual sales are generally made from summer through early fall, which coincides with our third and fourth fiscal quarters, and accordingly, our cash flow is strongest in those quarters. Due to the seasonality of our business, as well as the evolution and changes in our business and product mix, including our acquisition of Hudson, the sale of the Joe's Business, and the acquisition of the Robert Graham Business, our quarterly or yearly results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next quarter or year. Furthermore, because of the growing number of full-price retail and outlet stores opened at different points during the past few fiscal years, we continue to assess the seasonality of our business on our retail segment and its potential impact on our financial results.\nOur reportable business segments are Wholesale and Retail. We manage, evaluate and aggregate our operating segments for segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of business activity and operation. As of November 30, 2015, our Wholesale segment was comprised of sales of Hudson\u00ae products to retailers, specialty stores and international distributors, revenue from licensing agreements and includes expenses from sales, trade shows, distribution, product samples and customer service departments. As of November 30, 2015, our Retail segment was comprised of sales to consumers through ten Joe's\u00ae full-price retail stores, 11 Joe's\u00ae outlet stores and through our online retail site at www.hudsonjeans.com. Our Corporate and other is comprised of expenses from corporate operations, which include the executive, finance, legal, human resources, design and production departments and general advertising expenses associated with our products.\nSales of our Joe's\u00ae and else\u2122 products for our wholesale segment and for those retail stores being transferred pursuant to the Operating Assets Purchase Agreement and Joe's\u00ae online retail site are\npresented as discontinued operations as a result of the sale of those assets in our condensed consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.\nComparison of Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2015 to Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2014\n\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain statements of operations data by our reportable segments for the periods as indicated:\n\nFiscal Year 2015 Overview\nNet Sales\nOur net sales decreased to $80,199,000 in fiscal 2015 from $84,225,000 in fiscal 2014, a five percent decrease. Sales of our men's and women's denim bottoms continue to be impacted by a weakening in the overall denim market, as consumer preference shifts to non-denim bottoms. We have been focusing on designing new products in a variety of fits and washes with new and innovative fabrics to give the customer a reason to purchase a new pair of jeans.\nMore specifically, our wholesale net sales decreased to $66,713,000 from fiscal 2015 from $68,377,000 for fiscal 2014, a two percent decrease. This decrease in our wholesale sales is primarily attributed to a decrease in our domestic men's wholesale and international sales.\nOur retail net sales decreased to $13,486,000 for fiscal 2015 from $15,848,000 for fiscal 2014, a 15 percent decrease, mostly due to lower traffic and the lease expiration for our Melrose store at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and our Northpark store in March 2014. Our Joe's\u00ae retail store sales decreased by $1,957,000 and Hudson's\u00ae e-shop sales decreased by $406,000. Same store sales for our brick and mortar Joe's\u00ae stores decreased by 14 percent. Same store sales for our Hudson\u00ae e-shop decreased by 12 percent.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit decreased to $32,279,000 for fiscal 2015 from $39,723,000 for fiscal 2014, a 19 percent decrease. Our overall gross margin was 40 percent for fiscal 2015 compared to 47 percent for fiscal 2014.\nOur wholesale gross profit decreased to $23,022,000 for fiscal 2015 from $29,006,000 for fiscal 2014, a 21 percent decrease. Our wholesale gross profit decreased for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 due to lower wholesale sales, $3,246,000 of additional inventory write down for finished goods and fabric, and liquidation sales related to aged inventory. Our wholesale gross margin percentage for fiscal 2015 decreased to 35 percent compared to 42 percent for the prior year comparable period. The decrease in gross margin percentage is mostly attributed to additional inventory write down for finished goods and fabric, as we continue to monitor and make adjustments, as necessary, and liquidation sales related to aged inventory.\nOur retail gross profit decreased to $9,257,000 for fiscal 2015 from $10,717,000 for fiscal 2014, a 14 percent decrease. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower store traffic. Our retail gross margin percentage increased to 69 percent in fiscal 2015 compared to 68 percent in fiscal 2014.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense, including Depreciation and Amortization and Impairment of Assets\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses, including, depreciation and amortization and impairment of assets, decreased to $65,568,000 for fiscal 2015 from $70,391,000 for fiscal 2014, a seven percent decrease. Our SG&A expenses were impacted by additional fees of $6,778,000 in connection with investment banking, restructuring and legal advice related to the evaluation of our strategic alternatives in connection with the default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement. Our SG&A includes expenses related to employee and employee related benefits, sales commissions, contingent consideration expense, advertising, sample production, facilities and distribution related costs, professional fees, stock-based compensation, factor and bank fees, fees associated with the evaluation of our strategic alternatives related to the default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement, expenses related to Hudson's operation as our subsidiary and also includes depreciation and amortization and impairment of assets. Our SG&A expenses decreased due to a decrease in impairment charges for fiscal 2015.\nOur wholesale SG&A expense increased to $11,549,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $10,456,000 for fiscal 2014, a 10 percent increase. Our wholesale SG&A expense was higher in fiscal 2015 mostly due to higher samples, tradeshow and bad debt expense.\nOur retail SG&A expense decreased to $12,369,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $12,491,000 for fiscal 2014, a one percent decrease. Our retail SG&A expense decreased mostly due to the costs associated with operating one less store between the end of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, which included a reduction in store payroll, rent and depreciation expense. In fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we recorded a retail store impairment charges of $1,732,000 and $840,000, respectively, related to the property and equipment at our retail stores. Based on the operating performance of these stores, we believed that we could not recover the carrying value of the property and equipment at these stores.\nOur corporate and other SG&A expense decreased to $41,650,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $47,444,000 for fiscal 2014, a 12 percent decrease. Our corporate and other SG&A expense includes general overhead associated with our operations, including Hudson and impairment charges related to our intangible assets. Our decrease in SG&A expenses was attributable to a goodwill impairment charge of $23,585,000 recorded in fiscal 2014 that was partially offset by a trademark impairment charge of $12,400,000 in fiscal 2015. We recorded a trademark impairment charge on our Hudson trademark because the carrying value exceeded its fair market value. We also recorded additional professional fees of $6,778,000 in connection with investment banking, restructuring and legal advice related to strategic alternatives in connection with the default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOperating Loss from Continuing Operations\nWe had an operating loss of $33,289,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $30,668,000 for fiscal 2014. Our increase in operating loss was primarily due to lower wholesale sales and gross profit as discussed above.\nOur wholesale operating income decreased to $11,473,000 for fiscal 2015 from $18,550,000 for fiscal 2014, a 38 percent decrease. We generated a retail operating loss of $3,112,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $1,774,000 for fiscal 2014. Corporate operating loss decreased to $41,650,000 for fiscal 2015 from an operating loss of $47,444,000 for fiscal 2014.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense increased to $6,621,000 for fiscal 2015 from $5,141,000 for fiscal 2014. Our interest expense is primarily associated with interest expense from the Revolving Credit Agreement with CIT, interest expense and PIK interest from the Convertible Notes and amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs associated with the finance arrangements resulting from the Hudson acquisition. Effective retroactively to October 1, 2014, we began paying additional interest to both CIT and the convertible notes, respectively, due to the default under the respective agreements.\nOther Income\nOther income represents the income due to the change in fair value of the embedded conversion derivative from November 30, 2014 to May 31, 2014 of $2,268,000 for the six months ended May 31, 2014.\nIncome Tax\nOur effective tax rate from continuing operations was 6 percent for fiscal 2015 compared to 15 percent for fiscal 2014. The decreased effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 resulted from the adjustments related to the valuation allowance. For fiscal 2015, the valuation allowance associated with deferred\ntaxes as of November 30, 2014, increased by $13,841,000. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in our assessment of the valuation allowance. On September 11, 2015, we completed the Asset Sale which was an asset disposition and resulted in the utilization of certain deferred taxes. We decreased our valuation allowance for these utilized deferred taxes resulting in a net increase of our valuation allowance of $11,620,000. For fiscal 2015, we recorded an income tax expense on discontinued operations of $4,663,000.\nLoss from Continuing Operations\nWe generated a loss from continued operations of $37,356,000 in fiscal 2015 compared to $28,482,000 in fiscal 2014.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nWe generated income from discontinued operations of $5,028,000 in fiscal 2015 compared to $766,000 in fiscal 2014. The increase in income from discontinued operations is primarily attributable to a gain on disposal of Joe's\u00ae trademarks and operating assets as a result of the sale of certain of those assets.\nNet Loss and Comprehensive Loss\nWe generated a net loss of $32,328,000 in fiscal 2015 compared to $27,716,000 in fiscal 2014.\nComparison of Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2014 to Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2013\n\n(1)Includes results of operation for Hudson from the acquisition date of September 30, 2013 through the end of our fiscal year ended November 30, 2013.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain statements of operations data by our reportable segments from continuing operations for the periods as indicated:\n\n(1)Includes results of operation for Hudson from the acquisition date of September 30, 2013 through the end of our fiscal year ended November 30, 2013.\nFiscal Year 2014 Overview\nNet Sales\nOur net sales from continuing operations increased to $84,225,000 in fiscal 2014 from $28,417,000 in fiscal 2013, a 196 percent increase.\nMore specifically, our wholesale net sales from continuing operations increased to $68,377,000 from fiscal 2014 from $15,621,000 for fiscal 2013, a 338 percent increase. This increase in our wholesale sales is attributed to the $52,756,000 in wholesale sales for a full year from Hudson\u00ae.\nOur retail net sales from continuing operations increased to $15,848,000 for fiscal 2014 from $12,796,000 for fiscal 2013, a 24 percent increase. The primary reason for this increase was due to including a full year of retail sales from Hudson's\u00ae e-shop in fiscal 2014 compared to two months in fiscal 2013. Same store sales for Joe's\u00ae stores opened at least 12 months decreased by five percent.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit from continuing operations increased to $39,723,000 for fiscal 2014 from $13,966,000 for fiscal 2013, a 184 percent increase. Our overall gross margin decreased to 47 percent from 49 percent for fiscal 2013.\nOur wholesale gross profit from continuing operations increased to $29,006,000 for fiscal 2014 from $5,227,000 for fiscal 2013, a 455 percent increase. Our wholesale gross profit grew for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to the addition of a full year of sales from Hudson\u00ae. Our wholesale gross margin for fiscal 2014 increased to 42 percent compared to 33 percent for the prior year comparable\nperiod. The increase in gross margin can be mostly attributed to an amortization charge of approximately $2,000,000 in fiscal 2013 and $1,000,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 related to a fair value step up of inventory acquired from Hudson and subsequently sold in fiscal 2014.\nOur retail gross profit from continuing operations increased to $10,717,000 for fiscal 2014 from $8,739,000 for fiscal 2013, a 23 percent increase. This increase is primarily attributable to the additional retail sales from Hudson's\u00ae e-shop that generated an additional $2,176,000 in gross profit for fiscal 2014. We did not open any additional store locations in fiscal 2014. Our retail gross margin percentage was comparable at 68 percent in both periods.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense, including Depreciation and Amortization and Impairment of Assets\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses, including, depreciation and amortization and impairment of assets, from continuing operations increased to $70,391,000 for fiscal 2014 from $23,275,000 for fiscal 2013, a 202 percent increase. Our SG&A expenses increased primarily due to a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge as the carrying value of our Hudson wholesale reporting unit exceeded our fair market value and $25,322,000 of additional expenses related to the operation of our Hudson subsidiary for a full year. Our SG&A includes expenses related to employee and employee related benefits, sales commissions, advertising, sample production, facilities and distribution related costs, professional fees, stock-based compensation, factor and bank fees, impairment of assets, transaction expenses in connection with the Hudson acquisition and also includes depreciation and amortization.\nOur wholesale SG&A expense from continuing operations increased to $10,456,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to $1,527,000 for fiscal 2013, a 585 percent increase. Our wholesale SG&A expense was higher in fiscal 2014 mostly due to the additional SG&A expense associated with a full year of Hudson's operations.\nOur retail SG&A expense from continuing operations increased to $12,491,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to $9,759,000 for fiscal 2013, a 28 percent increase. Our retail SG&A expense increased mostly due to an additional retail expense of $1,407,000 associated with Hudson's e-commerce operations. In fiscal 2014, we recorded a retail store impairment charge of $840,000 related to the property and equipment at six of our retail stores. Based on the operating performance of these stores, we believed that we could not recover the carrying value of the property and equipment at these stores. In addition, fiscal 2014 also includes the full year of operations of four stores opened at various times during fiscal 2013.\nOur corporate and other SG&A expense from continuing operations increased to $47,444,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to $11,989,000 for fiscal 2013, a 296 percent increase. Our corporate and other SG&A expense includes general overhead associated with our operations, including Hudson, and professional fees and other transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of Hudson. Our corporate and other SG&A expense includes a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge for fiscal 2014 as the carrying value of our Hudson wholesale reporting unit exceeded our fair market value. In fiscal 2013, we recorded $4,262,000 of transaction expenses in connection with the acquisition of Hudson that we did not have in fiscal 2014. We also had additional expenses for Hudson's a full year of corporate operations of $14,986,000 in fiscal 2014 that we did not have in fiscal 2013.\nOperating Loss from Continuing Operations\nWe had an operating loss from continuing operations of $30,668,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to $9,309,000 for fiscal 2013. We generated a higher operating loss primarily due to a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge for fiscal 2014.\nDue to the addition of a full year of Hudson's operations, our wholesale operating income increased to $18,550,000 for fiscal 2014 from $3,700,000 for fiscal 2013, a 401 percent increase. As a result of negative same store sales, lower gross margins, higher expenses associated with operating four stores for a full fiscal year and a retail store impairment charge, we generated a retail operating loss of $1,774,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to an operating loss of $1,020,000 for fiscal 2013. Corporate operating loss increased to $47,444,000 for fiscal 2014 from an operating loss of $11,989,000 for fiscal 2013 mostly due to a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge for fiscal 2014.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense from continuing operations increased to $5,141,000 for fiscal 2014 from $1,032,000 for fiscal 2013. Our interest expense is primarily associated with interest expense from our Revolving Credit Agreement with CIT and the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs associated the finance arrangements resulting from the Hudson acquisition in September 2013. We entered into the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement in September 2013, therefore, our interest expense in 2013 only reflects two months of interest under these agreements. Effective retroactively to October 1, 2014, we began paying additional interest to both CIT and Garrison, respectively, due to the default under the respective agreements. We pay to CIT an additional one percent interest and Garrison an additional two percent interest.\nOther Expense\nOther expense from continuing operations mostly represents the change in fair value of the embedded conversion derivative from November 30, 2013 to May 8, 2014, the date of our annual meeting of stockholders approving the conversion of shares under the convertible notes, and this change in value was $2,268,000 for fiscal 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate from continuing operations was 15 percent for fiscal 2014 compared to 30 percent for fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, we had an unfavorable permanent book/tax difference associated with goodwill impairment, which reduced our tax benefit. For fiscal 2013, we had expenses that were not deductible for tax related to the acquisition of Hudson, which reduced our tax benefit.\nLoss from Continuing Operations\nWe generated a loss from continuing operations of $28,482,000 in fiscal 2014 compared to $7,416,000 in fiscal 2013.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nWe generated income from discontinued operations of $766,000 in fiscal 2014 compared to $102,000 in fiscal 2013.\nNet Loss and Comprehensive Loss\nWe generated a net loss of $27,716,000 in fiscal 2014 compared to a net loss of $7,314,000 in fiscal 2013. The increase in our net loss was primarily due to a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge for fiscal 2014, a retail store impairment charge of $840,000 and higher interest expense operating associated with the acquisition of Hudson.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nUntil the acquisition of Hudson on September 30, 2013, our primary sources of liquidity were: (i) cash from sales of our products; (ii) sales from accounts receivable factoring facilities and advances against inventory; and (iii) utilizing existing cash balances. Beginning September 30, 2013, in connection with the acquisition of Hudson, we entered into an amended and restated accounts receivable factoring facility and the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement that provided advances to us for eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory up to $50,000,000, based upon the value of the eligible accounts receivable and inventory less any reserves imposed by CIT. The initial proceeds from the advances under this revolving credit facility, which included accounts receivable and inventory borrowing, were used to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition and fees and expenses associated with the acquisition and the remainder was used to repay our existing factor loans and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. In connection with the Asset Sale, we repaid a portion of our indebtedness under the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and amended the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement pursuant to the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement. The CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, which was amended by Amendment No. 1 on December 29, 2015, provided for a maturity date of February 8, 2016. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of Hudson, we entered into the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement for $60,000,000 with Garrison to finance the remainder of the purchase price required for the acquisition. Under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, we paid interest to Garrison and were required to make prepayments under certain circumstances. The term loan was set to mature on September 30, 2018. We used a portion of the proceeds of the Asset Sale to repay all of our indebtedness outstanding under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement. As a result, the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement was paid in full and terminated on September 11, 2015. On January 28, 2016, all outstanding loans under the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement were repaid and it was terminated in connection with entering into the New Credit Agreements (discussed below). Both the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, along with the Convertible Notes issued in connection with the acquisition of Hudson are discussed in more detail below under \"Financing Arrangements Related to the Acquisition of Hudson.\"\nUnder the amended and restated factoring agreement entered into on September 30, 2013, we sell or assign to CIT certain of our accounts receivable, including accounts arising from or related to sales of inventory and the rendition of services. We pay a factoring rate of 0.50 percent for accounts for which CIT bears the credit risk, subject to discretionary surcharges and 0.35 percent for accounts for which we bear the credit risk, but in no event less than $3.50 per invoice. The interest rate associated with borrowings equals the interest rate then in effect for \"Revolving A Loans\" pursuant to the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement. As of November 30, 2015, that interest rate was approximately 4.83 percent. The amended and restated factoring agreement may be terminated by CIT upon 60 days' written notice or immediately upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the agreement. In connection with the Asset Sale, we also entered into a Reassignment and Termination Agreement, dated as of September 11, 2015 (the \"Reassignment and Termination Agreement\"), pursuant to which Joe's Jeans Subsidiary, Inc. (\"Joe's Sub\") was terminated as a party to the amended and restated factoring agreement and CIT reassigned to Joe's Sub all of its accounts factored with CIT that were outstanding. The amended and restated factoring agreement may be terminated by us upon 60 days' written notice prior to September 30, 2018 or annually with 60 days' written notice prior to September 30th of each year thereafter and remains effective until terminated.\nIn January 2016, the amended and restated factoring agreement was amended, superseded and replaced in its entirety by the Amended and Restated Deferred Purchase Factoring Agreement with CIT, Robert Graham Designs, LLC and Hudson (the \"A&R Factoring Agreement\"). The A&R Factoring Agreement is substantially similar to the amended and restated factoring agreement with the exception of the fees. Under the A&R Factoring Agreement, we pay a factoring rate of (i) 0.20 percent for\ncertain major department store accounts, (ii) 0.40 percent for all other accounts for which CIT bears the credit risk, subject to discretionary surcharges, and (iii) 0.35 percent for accounts for which we bear the credit risk, but in no event less than $3.50 per invoice. The A&R Factoring Agreement may be terminated by CIT upon 60 days' written notice or immediately upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the agreement. The A&R Factoring Agreement may be terminated by us upon 60 days' written notice prior to December 31, 2020 or annually with 60 days' written notice prior to December 31st of each year thereafter.\nFor the fiscal year ended 2015, we generated $8,599,000 of cash flow from operations mostly from the collection of receivables and liquidation of aged inventory. Cash flow used in financing activities consisted of $27,756,000 of repayments under our revolving credit facility and $59,925,000 of repayments under our term loan. We made payments of $86,000 for taxes on restricted stock units and we purchased $117,000 in restricted stock. We received $80,000,000 from the sale of the Joe's\u00ae Business We used $485,000 in investing activities for the purchase of property and equipment. Our cash balance increased to $1,937,000 as of November 30, 2015.\nAs of November 30, 2015, our cash balance was $1,937,000 and our borrowing base cash availability with CIT was approximately $3,163,000. As of November 30, 2014, our cash balance was $1,054,000 and our cash availability with CIT was approximately $12,000,000. This amount with CIT fluctuates on a daily basis based upon invoicing and collection related activity by CIT on our behalf. As of November 30, 2015, our revolving credit facility had a balance of $4,235,000. As of November 30, 2014, our revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of $31,338,000.\nFor fiscal 2016, our primary capital needs are for: (i) operating expenses; (ii) payments, including interest required to be made under our New Credit Agreements and Modified Convertible Notes; (iii) working capital necessary to fund inventory purchases; (iv) integration and other costs associated with the Merger; (v) financing extensions of trade credit to our customers; (vi) payments for expenses associated with the Merger and the Merger Transactions. We anticipate funding our operations through working capital generated by the following: (i) cash flow from sales of our products from the combined companies; (ii) managing our operating expenses and inventory levels; (iii) maximizing trade payables with our domestic and international suppliers; (iv) increasing collection efforts on existing accounts receivables; and (v) utilizing proceeds from our New Credit Agreements.\nBased on our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and the expected borrowing availability under the New Credit Agreements and the A&R Factoring Agreement based upon our borrowing base and sales forecasts, we believe that we have the working capital resources necessary to meet our projected operational needs for fiscal 2016. However, if we require more capital for growth and integration or if we experience a decline in sales and/or operating losses, we believe that it will be necessary to obtain additional working capital through additional credit arrangements.\nWe believe that the rate of inflation over the past few years has not had a significant adverse impact on our net sales or income from continuing operations.\nFinancing Arrangements Related to the Acquisition of Hudson, the Merger and the Merger Transactions\nConvertible Notes\nWe issued Convertible Notes in connection with the acquisition of Hudson with different interest rates and conversion features for Hudson's management stockholders and Fireman, respectively. Interest on the Convertible Notes was paid in a combination of cash and additional paid-in-kind notes, or PIK notes. All of the Convertible Notes were structurally and contractually subordinated to our senior debt and matured on March 31, 2019. All of the notes were expressly junior and subordinated in right of payment to all amounts due and owing upon any indebtedness outstanding under the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement (as discussed below). Due\nto the defaults and events of default under the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, we were prohibited from making any payments under the Convertible Notes.\nOn September 8, 2015, we entered into the Rollover Agreement with the holders of our Convertible Notes, pursuant to which, on January 28, 2016, the holders of the Convertible Notes contributed to us the Convertible Notes in exchange for the following:\n\u2022 1,167,317 shares of Common Stock;\n\u2022 a cash payment of approximately $8.6 million, before expenses; and\n\u2022 an aggregate principal amount of approximately $16.5 million of Modified Convertible Notes.\nThe Modified Convertible Notes are structurally and contractually subordinated to our senior debt and will mature on July 28, 2021. The Modified Convertible Notes accrue interest quarterly on the outstanding principal amount at a rate of 6.5% per", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIntroduction\nThis discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and financial conditions during the fiscal years ended November 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental information in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered forward-looking. These statements contain a number of risks and uncertainties, as discussed under the heading \"Forward-Looking Statements\" of this Annual Report that could cause actual results to differ materially. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Our future results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nWe completed the acquisition of Hudson on September 30, 2013 and the information presented includes the results of operations of Hudson from that date through the end of our fiscal year of November 30, 2013, which was approximately two months of operations, and its financial results are included in each of the two reportable segments in a manner consistent with our reporting structure. Therefore, our results of operations for the fiscal year 2013 are not necessarily indicative of future results. Our financial results for fiscal 2015 and 2014 reflect a full year of operations for our Hudson subsidiary.\nWe completed the sale of certain of our operating and intellectual property assets related to the Joe's Business to two separate purchasers for an aggregate purchase price of $80 million in September 2015, and, as a result, sales of our Joe's\u00ae products are presented as held for sale (discontinued operations) in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. As part of the Asset Sale, we entered into the IP Asset Purchase Agreement with the IP Assets Purchaser and, solely for the purposes of its related guarantee, Sequential Brands Group, Inc., pursuant to which, the IP Assets Purchaser, among other things, purchased the Intellectual Property Assets used or held for use in the Joe's Business. The aggregate purchase price was $67 million. Simultaneous with the IP Asset Purchase Agreement, we entered into the Operating Asset Purchase Agreement with the Operating Assets Purchaser, pursuant to which the Operating Assets Purchaser, among other things, purchased certain inventory and other assets and assumed certain liabilities from us and our subsidiaries related to the Joe's Business, including certain employees of the Joe's Business and, at a later date, specified Joe's store leases. The aggregate purchase price was $13 million. At the closing of the sale, both the IP Assets Purchaser and the Operating Assets Purchaser deposited an aggregate of $4.0 million into an escrow account, which will be used to defer certain costs and expenses which may be incurred by us after the closing of the transaction.\nExecutive Overview and Subsequent Events\nOur principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing of apparel products, which include denim jeans, related casual wear and accessories that bear the brand Hudson\u00ae. Historically, until September 2015, we also had apparel products bearing the Joe's\u00ae brand. Joe's\u00ae was established in 2001 and the brand is recognized in the premium denim industry, an industry term for denim jeans with price points generally of $120 or more, for its quality, fit and fashion-forward designs.\nAs a result of the Asset Sale, sales of our Joe's\u00ae products are presented as held for sale (discontinued operations) in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Hudson\u00ae was established in 2002, and is similarly recognized as a premier designer and marketer of women's and men's premium branded denim apparel. Because we focus on design, development and marketing, we rely on third parties to manufacture our apparel products. We sell our products through our own retail stores, our websites and to numerous retailers, which include major department stores, specialty stores and distributors around the world.\nOn September 30, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Hudson for an aggregate purchase price consisting of approximately $65,416,000 in cash and approximately $27,451,000 in convertible notes, net of discount. This acquisition provided us with an additional proven premium denim brand and enhanced our prospects for growth across wholesale, retail and e-commerce, both domestically and overseas, and created the potential for improved purchasing authority with current and future vendors and other operational efficiencies. As of September 30, 2013, the acquired business represented approximately 40 percent of our consolidated total assets at November 30, 2013 and approximately three percent of consolidated net loss for the year ended November 30, 2013.\nDuring fiscal 2014 and 2015, we believed that our growth potential relied on the integration of the Hudson and Joe's Jeans operations. We did not achieve the desired level of integration on our original timetable. As a result, we failed to meet certain financial covenants set forth in the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement. On November 6, 2014, we received a notice of default and demand for payment of default interest from Garrison, as term loan agent, under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement. As a result of the default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, we were also in default under the terms of our CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and our factoring facility with CIT and we were prohibited from making payments under the Convertible Notes and the obligations to Mr. Dahan.\nAdditionally, during the first half of fiscal 2015, our business was also impacted by a decrease in overall sales in both our wholesale and retail segments. During fiscal 2014, our business was impacted by a decline in our overall Joe's\u00ae business, but offset by the addition of sales from the acquisition of Hudson. On a comparative basis, sales of our men's and women's denim bottoms were, and continue to be, impacted by a weakening in the overall denim market, as consumer preference shifts to non-denim bottoms. Both brands have been focused on designing new products in a variety of fits and washes with new and innovative fabrics to give the customer a reason to purchase a new pair of jeans. Beginning in fiscal 2012, we also offered a line, else\u2122, that had price points starting at $68 and was created to reach young women who are looking for a premium denim-like product at a more affordable price. As of fiscal 2014, we began to re-evaluate this brand and significant decreases in sales related to this brand impacted our comparative sales for fiscal 2014. We sold the else\u2122 trademark pursuant to the Asset Sale and at the time of the sale, the else\u2122 brand had very limited assets and distribution in the international market.\nOn January 19, 2015, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Marc. B. Crossman, resigned. As a result of the defaults and the resignation of our CEO, our Board determined that it was in the best interests of the company and our stockholders to explore all of strategic alternatives to remedy the defaults with our lenders and to find a new CEO to lead us. On January 29, 2015, we engaged Carl Marks Advisory Group Inc. (\"Carl Marks\") to help us explore all of our alternatives to resolve our financial condition. In March 2015, Carl Marks launched its strategic transaction process seeking proposals for transactions that would generate enough funds that would allow the Company to repay the term loan in full. The indications of interest were for a wide variety of transactions including a partial refinancing, IP sale/license transaction, asset sale transaction and a merger/recapitalization transaction. As part of the process, on September 8, 2015, we entered into various definitive agreements intended to provide a total solution to resolving the Company's operational, financial and management issues, pursuant to which we agreed to (i) the Asset Sale, which was completed\nSeptember 11, 2015, whereby we sold certain of our operating and intellectual property assets related to the Joe's Business for a total of $80 million, (ii) combine our remaining business operated under the Hudson brand with RG pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (iii) issue and sell $50 million of our Series A Preferred Stock in a private placement to an affiliate of TCP pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, (iv) exchange our outstanding Convertible Notes for a combination of cash, shares of our common stock and the Modified Convertible Notes and (v) gain a CEO with public company experience. On September 11, 2015, the proceeds of the Asset Sale were used to repay all of our indebtedness outstanding under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and a portion of our indebtedness outstanding under our Revolving Credit Agreement. As a result, the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement was paid in full and terminated on September 11, 2015 and we entered in the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with CIT, which provided for a maximum credit availability of $7.5 million and waived certain defaults. On January 28, 2016, all outstanding loans under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement were repaid and it was terminated in connection with entering into (i) a new credit and security agreement (the \"ABL Credit Agreement\") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as lender, and (ii) a new credit and security agreement with TCW Asset Management Company, as agent, and the lenders party thereto (the \"Term Credit Agreement\", and together with the ABL Credit Agreement, the \"New Credit Agreements\"). On January 28, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of RG, as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 8, 2015 (the \"Merger Agreement\"), by and among RG, Merger Sub and us, for an aggregate of $81.0 million in cash and 8,870,968 shares of our common stock (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split (as defined below)). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub was merged with and into RG, so that RG, as the surviving entity, became our wholly-owned subsidiary. RG is engaged in the design, development, sales and licensing of apparel products and accessories that bear the brand name Robert Graham\u00ae.\nEffective upon consummation of the Merger, we changed our name to Differential Brands Group Inc. and effected a reverse stock split (the \"Reverse Stock Split\") of our issued and outstanding common stock such that each thirty shares of our issued and outstanding common stock was reclassified into one share of our issued and outstanding common stock. The Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value or the amount of authorized shares of our common stock. The primary purpose of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the per-share market price of our common stock in order to maintain our listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market maintained by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"NASDAQ\").\nIn connection with the Merger, on January 28, 2016, we completed issuance and sale of an aggregate of fifty thousand (50,000) shares of our preferred stock, designated as \"Series A Convertible Preferred Stock\" (the \"Series A Preferred Stock\"), for an aggregate purchase price of $50 million in cash, as contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, dated as of September 8, 2015 (the \"Stock Purchase Agreement\"), by and between us and TCP Denim, LLC (the \"Series A Purchaser\").\nWe used the proceeds from the Stock Purchase Agreement and the debt financing provided by the credit facilities under the New Credit Agreements to, among other things, consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nAlso in connection with the completion of Merger, on January 28, 2016, we completed the exchange of our outstanding convertible notes for (i) 1,167,317 shares of common stock (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split); (ii) a cash payment of approximately $8.6 million; and (iii) an aggregate principal amount of approximately $16.5 million of modified convertible notes (the \"Modified Convertible Notes\"), as contemplated by the rollover agreement, dated September 8, 2015 (the \"Rollover Agreement\"), between us and the holders of our convertible notes.\nOur Joe's\u00ae product line, which was sold pursuant to the Asset Sale, included women's and men's denim jeans, pants, shirts, sweaters, jackets and other apparel products. We also offered under our\nJoe's\u00ae brand women's handbags and clutches, women's intimates, children's products, shoes, belts and leather goods produced by us or under various license agreements and we received royalty payments based upon net sales from licensees. Our Hudson\u00ae product line includes women's, men's and children's denim jeans, pants, jackets and other bottoms. Similar to the evolution of Joe's\u00ae, we continue to evaluate offering a range of products under the Hudson\u00ae brand name.\nOur Robert Graham\u00ae product line includes premium priced men's sport shirts, denim jeans, pants, shorts, sweaters, knits, t-shirts, sportcoats, outerwear, and swimwear. RG also offers a line of women's apparel, mainly in its own retail stores. Additionally, men's shoes, belts, small leather goods, dress shirts, neckwear, tailored clothing, headwear, eye and sun glasses, jewelry, hosiery, underwear, loungewear and fragrances are produced by third parties under various license agreements and RG receives royalty payments based upon net sales from licensees.\nAfter the closing of the Operating Asset Purchase Agreement and the IP Asset Purchase Agreement, we retained and operated 32 Joe's\u00ae brand retail stores. Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Asset Purchase Agreement, we transferred 18 retail stores to the Operating Assets Purchaser on January 28, 2016 for no additional consideration. As of February 29, 2016, the remaining 14 Joe's\u00ae brand retail stores were closed. The retail stores being transferred have been included as part of our discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report. The Operating Assets Purchaser supplies Joe's\u00ae branded merchandise to the retail stores for resale under a license from the IP Assets Purchaser. As of February 29, 2016 we had 30 Robert Graham\u00ae brand stores, which consisted of 18 full price stores and 12 outlet stores. Two additional leases for Robert Graham\u00ae brand full price stores have been signed for 2016 openings.\nFor 2016, we believe that our growth drivers will be dependent upon the successful integration of the Hudson Business and the Robert Graham Business as a result of the Merger, which includes reducing expenses and achieving synergies that we expect as a result of the Merger. Other growth drivers include cost saving measures related to the operation of our Hudson Business and the performance of each of our Hudson Business and our Robert Graham Business.\nOur business is seasonal. The majority of the marketing and sales orders take place from late fall to late spring. The greatest volume of shipments and actual sales are generally made from summer through early fall, which coincides with our third and fourth fiscal quarters, and accordingly, our cash flow is strongest in those quarters. Due to the seasonality of our business, as well as the evolution and changes in our business and product mix, including our acquisition of Hudson, the sale of the Joe's Business, and the acquisition of the Robert Graham Business, our quarterly or yearly results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next quarter or year. Furthermore, because of the growing number of full-price retail and outlet stores opened at different points during the past few fiscal years, we continue to assess the seasonality of our business on our retail segment and its potential impact on our financial results.\nOur reportable business segments are Wholesale and Retail. We manage, evaluate and aggregate our operating segments for segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of business activity and operation. As of November 30, 2015, our Wholesale segment was comprised of sales of Hudson\u00ae products to retailers, specialty stores and international distributors, revenue from licensing agreements and includes expenses from sales, trade shows, distribution, product samples and customer service departments. As of November 30, 2015, our Retail segment was comprised of sales to consumers through ten Joe's\u00ae full-price retail stores, 11 Joe's\u00ae outlet stores and through our online retail site at www.hudsonjeans.com. Our Corporate and other is comprised of expenses from corporate operations, which include the executive, finance, legal, human resources, design and production departments and general advertising expenses associated with our products.\nSales of our Joe's\u00ae and else\u2122 products for our wholesale segment and for those retail stores being transferred pursuant to the Operating Assets Purchase Agreement and Joe's\u00ae online retail site are\npresented as discontinued operations as a result of the sale of those assets in our condensed consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.\nComparison of Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2015 to Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2014\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

$80,199,000 in fiscal 2015 from $84,225,000 in fiscal 2014, a five percent decrease. Sales of our men's and women's denim bottoms continue to be impacted by a weakening in the overall denim market, as consumer preference shifts to non-denim bottoms. We have been focusing on designing new products in a variety of fits and washes with new and innovative fabrics to give the customer a reason to purchase a new pair of jeans.\nMore specifically, our wholesale net sales decreased to $66,713,000 from fiscal 2015 from $68,377,000 for fiscal 2014, a two percent decrease. This decrease in our wholesale sales is primarily attributed to a decrease in our domestic men's wholesale and international sales.\nOur retail net sales decreased to $13,486,000 for fiscal 2015 from $15,848,000 for fiscal 2014, a 15 percent decrease, mostly due to lower traffic and the lease expiration for our Melrose store at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and our Northpark store in March 2014. Our Joe's\u00ae retail store sales decreased by $1,957,000 and Hudson's\u00ae e-shop sales decreased by $406,000. Same store sales for our brick and mortar Joe's\u00ae stores decreased by 14 percent. Same store sales for our Hudson\u00ae e-shop decreased by 12 percent.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit decreased to $32,279,000 for fiscal 2015 from $39,723,000 for fiscal 2014, a 19 percent decrease. Our overall gross margin was 40 percent for fiscal 2015 compared to 47 percent for fiscal 2014.\nOur wholesale gross profit decreased to $23,022,000 for fiscal 2015 from $29,006,000 for fiscal 2014, a 21 percent decrease. Our wholesale gross profit decreased for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 due to lower wholesale sales, $3,246,000 of additional inventory write down for finished goods and fabric, and liquidation sales related to aged inventory. Our wholesale gross margin percentage for fiscal 2015 decreased to 35 percent compared to 42 percent for the prior year comparable period. The decrease in gross margin percentage is mostly attributed to additional inventory write down for finished goods and fabric, as we continue to monitor and make adjustments, as necessary, and liquidation sales related to aged inventory.\nOur retail gross profit decreased to $9,257,000 for fiscal 2015 from $10,717,000 for fiscal 2014, a 14 percent decrease. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower store traffic. Our retail gross margin percentage increased to 69 percent in fiscal 2015 compared to 68 percent in fiscal 2014.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense, including Depreciation and Amortization and Impairment of Assets\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses, including, depreciation and amortization and impairment of assets, decreased to $65,568,000 for fiscal 2015 from $70,391,000 for fiscal 2014, a seven percent decrease. Our SG&A expenses were impacted by additional fees of $6,778,000 in connection with investment banking, restructuring and legal advice related to the evaluation of our strategic alternatives in connection with the default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement. Our SG&A includes expenses related to employee and employee related benefits, sales commissions, contingent consideration expense, advertising, sample production, facilities and distribution related costs, professional fees, stock-based compensation, factor and bank fees, fees associated with the evaluation of our strategic alternatives related to the default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement, expenses related to Hudson's operation as our subsidiary and also includes depreciation and amortization and impairment of assets. Our SG&A expenses decreased due to a decrease in impairment charges for fiscal 2015.\nOur wholesale SG&A expense increased to $11,549,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $10,456,000 for fiscal 2014, a 10 percent increase. Our wholesale SG&A expense was higher in fiscal 2015 mostly due to higher samples, tradeshow and bad debt expense.\nOur retail SG&A expense decreased to $12,369,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $12,491,000 for fiscal 2014, a one percent decrease. Our retail SG&A expense decreased mostly due to the costs associated with operating one less store between the end of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, which included a reduction in store payroll, rent and depreciation expense. In fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we recorded a retail store impairment charges of $1,732,000 and $840,000, respectively, related to the property and equipment at our retail stores. Based on the operating performance of these stores, we believed that we could not recover the carrying value of the property and equipment at these stores.\nOur corporate and other SG&A expense decreased to $41,650,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $47,444,000 for fiscal 2014, a 12 percent decrease. Our corporate and other SG&A expense includes general overhead associated with our operations, including Hudson and impairment charges related to our intangible assets. Our decrease in SG&A expenses was attributable to a goodwill impairment charge of $23,585,000 recorded in fiscal 2014 that was partially offset by a trademark impairment charge of $12,400,000 in fiscal 2015. We recorded a trademark impairment charge on our Hudson trademark because the carrying value exceeded its fair market value. We also recorded additional professional fees of $6,778,000 in connection with investment banking, restructuring and legal advice related to strategic alternatives in connection with the default under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOperating Loss from Continuing Operations\nWe had an operating loss of $33,289,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $30,668,000 for fiscal 2014. Our increase in operating loss was primarily due to lower wholesale sales and gross profit as discussed above.\nOur wholesale operating income decreased to $11,473,000 for fiscal 2015 from $18,550,000 for fiscal 2014, a 38 percent decrease. We generated a retail operating loss of $3,112,000 for fiscal 2015 compared to $1,774,000 for fiscal 2014. Corporate operating loss decreased to $41,650,000 for fiscal 2015 from an operating loss of $47,444,000 for fiscal 2014.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense increased to $6,621,000 for fiscal 2015 from $5,141,000 for fiscal 2014. Our interest expense is primarily associated with interest expense from the Revolving Credit Agreement with CIT, interest expense and PIK interest from the Convertible Notes and amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs associated with the finance arrangements resulting from the Hudson acquisition. Effective retroactively to October 1, 2014, we began paying additional interest to both CIT and the convertible notes, respectively, due to the default under the respective agreements.\nOther Income\nOther income represents the income due to the change in fair value of the embedded conversion derivative from November 30, 2014 to May 31, 2014 of $2,268,000 for the six months ended May 31, 2014.\nIncome Tax\nOur effective tax rate from continuing operations was 6 percent for fiscal 2015 compared to 15 percent for fiscal 2014. The decreased effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 resulted from the adjustments related to the valuation allowance. For fiscal 2015, the valuation allowance associated with deferred\ntaxes as of November 30, 2014, increased by $13,841,000. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in our assessment of the valuation allowance. On September 11, 2015, we completed the Asset Sale which was an asset disposition and resulted in the utilization of certain deferred taxes. We decreased our valuation allowance for these utilized deferred taxes resulting in a net increase of our valuation allowance of $11,620,000. For fiscal 2015, we recorded an income tax expense on discontinued operations of $4,663,000.\nLoss from Continuing Operations\nWe generated a loss from continued operations of $37,356,000 in fiscal 2015 compared to $28,482,000 in fiscal 2014.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nWe generated income from discontinued operations of $5,028,000 in fiscal 2015 compared to $766,000 in fiscal 2014. The increase in income from discontinued operations is primarily attributable to a gain on disposal of Joe's\u00ae trademarks and operating assets as a result of the sale of certain of those assets.\nNet Loss and Comprehensive Loss\nWe generated a net loss of $32,328,000 in fiscal 2015 compared to $27,716,000 in fiscal 2014.\nComparison of Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2014 to Fiscal

from the acquisition date of September 30, 2013 through the end of our fiscal year ended November 30, 2013.\nFiscal Year 2014 Overview\nNet Sales\nOur net sales from continuing operations increased to $84,225,000 in fiscal 2014 from $28,417,000 in fiscal 2013, a 196 percent increase.\nMore specifically, our wholesale net sales from continuing operations increased to $68,377,000 from fiscal 2014 from $15,621,000 for fiscal 2013, a 338 percent increase. This increase in our wholesale sales is attributed to the $52,756,000 in wholesale sales for a full year from Hudson\u00ae.\nOur retail net sales from continuing operations increased to $15,848,000 for fiscal 2014 from $12,796,000 for fiscal 2013, a 24 percent increase. The primary reason for this increase was due to including a full year of retail sales from Hudson's\u00ae e-shop in fiscal 2014 compared to two months in fiscal 2013. Same store sales for Joe's\u00ae stores opened at least 12 months decreased by five percent.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit from continuing operations increased to $39,723,000 for fiscal 2014 from $13,966,000 for fiscal 2013, a 184 percent increase. Our overall gross margin decreased to 47 percent from 49 percent for fiscal 2013.\nOur wholesale gross profit from continuing operations increased to $29,006,000 for fiscal 2014 from $5,227,000 for fiscal 2013, a 455 percent increase. Our wholesale gross profit grew for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to the addition of a full year of sales from Hudson\u00ae. Our wholesale gross margin for fiscal 2014 increased to 42 percent compared to 33 percent for the prior year comparable\nperiod. The increase in gross margin can be mostly attributed to an amortization charge of approximately $2,000,000 in fiscal 2013 and $1,000,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 related to a fair value step up of inventory acquired from Hudson and subsequently sold in fiscal 2014.\nOur retail gross profit from continuing operations increased to $10,717,000 for fiscal 2014 from $8,739,000 for fiscal 2013, a 23 percent increase. This increase is primarily attributable to the additional retail sales from Hudson's\u00ae e-shop that generated an additional $2,176,000 in gross profit for fiscal 2014. We did not open any additional store locations in fiscal 2014. Our retail gross margin percentage was comparable at 68 percent in both periods.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense, including Depreciation and Amortization and Impairment of Assets\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses, including, depreciation and amortization and impairment of assets, from continuing operations increased to $70,391,000 for fiscal 2014 from $23,275,000 for fiscal 2013, a 202 percent increase. Our SG&A expenses increased primarily due to a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge as the carrying value of our Hudson wholesale reporting unit exceeded our fair market value and $25,322,000 of additional expenses related to the operation of our Hudson subsidiary for a full year. Our SG&A includes expenses related to employee and employee related benefits, sales commissions, advertising, sample production, facilities and distribution related costs, professional fees, stock-based compensation, factor and bank fees, impairment of assets, transaction expenses in connection with the Hudson acquisition and also includes depreciation and amortization.\nOur wholesale SG&A expense from continuing operations increased to $10,456,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to $1,527,000 for fiscal 2013, a 585 percent increase. Our wholesale SG&A expense was higher in fiscal 2014 mostly due to the additional SG&A expense associated with a full year of Hudson's operations.\nOur retail SG&A expense from continuing operations increased to $12,491,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to $9,759,000 for fiscal 2013, a 28 percent increase. Our retail SG&A expense increased mostly due to an additional retail expense of $1,407,000 associated with Hudson's e-commerce operations. In fiscal 2014, we recorded a retail store impairment charge of $840,000 related to the property and equipment at six of our retail stores. Based on the operating performance of these stores, we believed that we could not recover the carrying value of the property and equipment at these stores. In addition, fiscal 2014 also includes the full year of operations of four stores opened at various times during fiscal 2013.\nOur corporate and other SG&A expense from continuing operations increased to $47,444,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to $11,989,000 for fiscal 2013, a 296 percent increase. Our corporate and other SG&A expense includes general overhead associated with our operations, including Hudson, and professional fees and other transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of Hudson. Our corporate and other SG&A expense includes a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge for fiscal 2014 as the carrying value of our Hudson wholesale reporting unit exceeded our fair market value. In fiscal 2013, we recorded $4,262,000 of transaction expenses in connection with the acquisition of Hudson that we did not have in fiscal 2014. We also had additional expenses for Hudson's a full year of corporate operations of $14,986,000 in fiscal 2014 that we did not have in fiscal 2013.\nOperating Loss from Continuing Operations\nWe had an operating loss from continuing operations of $30,668,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to $9,309,000 for fiscal 2013. We generated a higher operating loss primarily due to a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge for fiscal 2014.\nDue to the addition of a full year of Hudson's operations, our wholesale operating income increased to $18,550,000 for fiscal 2014 from $3,700,000 for fiscal 2013, a 401 percent increase. As a result of negative same store sales, lower gross margins, higher expenses associated with operating four stores for a full fiscal year and a retail store impairment charge, we generated a retail operating loss of $1,774,000 for fiscal 2014 compared to an operating loss of $1,020,000 for fiscal 2013. Corporate operating loss increased to $47,444,000 for fiscal 2014 from an operating loss of $11,989,000 for fiscal 2013 mostly due to a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge for fiscal 2014.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense from continuing operations increased to $5,141,000 for fiscal 2014 from $1,032,000 for fiscal 2013. Our interest expense is primarily associated with interest expense from our Revolving Credit Agreement with CIT and the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs associated the finance arrangements resulting from the Hudson acquisition in September 2013. We entered into the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement in September 2013, therefore, our interest expense in 2013 only reflects two months of interest under these agreements. Effective retroactively to October 1, 2014, we began paying additional interest to both CIT and Garrison, respectively, due to the default under the respective agreements. We pay to CIT an additional one percent interest and Garrison an additional two percent interest.\nOther Expense\nOther expense from continuing operations mostly represents the change in fair value of the embedded conversion derivative from November 30, 2013 to May 8, 2014, the date of our annual meeting of stockholders approving the conversion of shares under the convertible notes, and this change in value was $2,268,000 for fiscal 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate from continuing operations was 15 percent for fiscal 2014 compared to 30 percent for fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, we had an unfavorable permanent book/tax difference associated with goodwill impairment, which reduced our tax benefit. For fiscal 2013, we had expenses that were not deductible for tax related to the acquisition of Hudson, which reduced our tax benefit.\nLoss from Continuing Operations\nWe generated a loss from continuing operations of $28,482,000 in fiscal 2014 compared to $7,416,000 in fiscal 2013.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nWe generated income from discontinued operations of $766,000 in fiscal 2014 compared to $102,000 in fiscal 2013.\nNet Loss and Comprehensive Loss\nWe generated a net loss of $27,716,000 in fiscal 2014 compared to a net loss of $7,314,000 in fiscal 2013. The increase in our net loss was primarily due to a $23,585,000 goodwill impairment charge for fiscal 2014, a retail store impairment charge of $840,000 and higher interest expense operating associated with the acquisition of Hudson.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nUntil the acquisition of Hudson on September 30, 2013, our primary sources of liquidity were: (i) cash from sales of our products; (ii) sales from accounts receivable factoring facilities and advances against inventory; and (iii) utilizing existing cash balances. Beginning September 30, 2013, in connection with the acquisition of Hudson, we entered into an amended and restated accounts receivable factoring facility and the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement that provided advances to us for eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory up to $50,000,000, based upon the value of the eligible accounts receivable and inventory less any reserves imposed by CIT. The initial proceeds from the advances under this revolving credit facility, which included accounts receivable and inventory borrowing, were used to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition and fees and expenses associated with the acquisition and the remainder was used to repay our existing factor loans and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. In connection with the Asset Sale, we repaid a portion of our indebtedness under the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and amended the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement pursuant to the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement. The CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, which was amended by Amendment No. 1 on December 29, 2015, provided for a maturity date of February 8, 2016. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of Hudson, we entered into the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement for $60,000,000 with Garrison to finance the remainder of the purchase price required for the acquisition. Under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, we paid interest to Garrison and were required to make prepayments under certain circumstances. The term loan was set to mature on September 30, 2018. We used a portion of the proceeds of the Asset Sale to repay all of our indebtedness outstanding under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement. As a result, the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement was paid in full and terminated on September 11, 2015. On January 28, 2016, all outstanding loans under the CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement were repaid and it was terminated in connection with entering into the New Credit Agreements (discussed below). Both the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, along with the Convertible Notes issued in connection with the acquisition of Hudson are discussed in more detail below under \"Financing Arrangements Related to the Acquisition of Hudson.\"\nUnder the amended and restated factoring agreement entered into on September 30, 2013, we sell or assign to CIT certain of our accounts receivable, including accounts arising from or related to sales of inventory and the rendition of services. We pay a factoring rate of 0.50 percent for accounts for which CIT bears the credit risk, subject to discretionary surcharges and 0.35 percent for accounts for which we bear the credit risk, but in no event less than $3.50 per invoice. The interest rate associated with borrowings equals the interest rate then in effect for \"Revolving A Loans\" pursuant to the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement. As of November 30, 2015, that interest rate was approximately 4.83 percent. The amended and restated factoring agreement may be terminated by CIT upon 60 days' written notice or immediately upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the agreement. In connection with the Asset Sale, we also entered into a Reassignment and Termination Agreement, dated as of September 11, 2015 (the \"Reassignment and Termination Agreement\"), pursuant to which Joe's Jeans Subsidiary, Inc. (\"Joe's Sub\") was terminated as a party to the amended and restated factoring agreement and CIT reassigned to Joe's Sub all of its accounts factored with CIT that were outstanding. The amended and restated factoring agreement may be terminated by us upon 60 days' written notice prior to September 30, 2018 or annually with 60 days' written notice prior to September 30th of each year thereafter and remains effective until terminated.\nIn January 2016, the amended and restated factoring agreement was amended, superseded and replaced in its entirety by the Amended and Restated Deferred Purchase Factoring Agreement with CIT, Robert Graham Designs, LLC and Hudson (the \"A&R Factoring Agreement\"). The A&R Factoring Agreement is substantially similar to the amended and restated factoring agreement with the exception of the fees. Under the A&R Factoring Agreement, we pay a factoring rate of (i) 0.20 percent for\ncertain major department store accounts, (ii) 0.40 percent for all other accounts for which CIT bears the credit risk, subject to discretionary surcharges, and (iii) 0.35 percent for accounts for which we bear the credit risk, but in no event less than $3.50 per invoice. The A&R Factoring Agreement may be terminated by CIT upon 60 days' written notice or immediately upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the agreement. The A&R Factoring Agreement may be terminated by us upon 60 days' written notice prior to December 31, 2020 or annually with 60 days' written notice prior to December 31st of each year thereafter.\nFor the fiscal year ended 2015, we generated $8,599,000 of cash flow from operations mostly from the collection of receivables and liquidation of aged inventory. Cash flow used in financing activities consisted of $27,756,000 of repayments under our revolving credit facility and $59,925,000 of repayments under our term loan. We made payments of $86,000 for taxes on restricted stock units and we purchased $117,000 in restricted stock. We received $80,000,000 from the sale of the Joe's\u00ae Business We used $485,000 in investing activities for the purchase of property and equipment. Our cash balance increased to $1,937,000 as of November 30, 2015.\nAs of November 30, 2015, our cash balance was $1,937,000 and our borrowing base cash availability with CIT was approximately $3,163,000. As of November 30, 2014, our cash balance was $1,054,000 and our cash availability with CIT was approximately $12,000,000. This amount with CIT fluctuates on a daily basis based upon invoicing and collection related activity by CIT on our behalf. As of November 30, 2015, our revolving credit facility had a balance of $4,235,000. As of November 30, 2014, our revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of $31,338,000.\nFor fiscal 2016, our primary capital needs are for: (i) operating expenses; (ii) payments, including interest required to be made under our New Credit Agreements and Modified Convertible Notes; (iii) working capital necessary to fund inventory purchases; (iv) integration and other costs associated with the Merger; (v) financing extensions of trade credit to our customers; (vi) payments for expenses associated with the Merger and the Merger Transactions. We anticipate funding our operations through working capital generated by the following: (i) cash flow from sales of our products from the combined companies; (ii) managing our operating expenses and inventory levels; (iii) maximizing trade payables with our domestic and international suppliers; (iv) increasing collection efforts on existing accounts receivables; and (v) utilizing proceeds from our New Credit Agreements.\nBased on our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and the expected borrowing availability under the New Credit Agreements and the A&R Factoring Agreement based upon our borrowing base and sales forecasts, we believe that we have the working capital resources necessary to meet our projected operational needs for fiscal 2016. However, if we require more capital for growth and integration or if we experience a decline in sales and/or operating losses, we believe that it will be necessary to obtain additional working capital through additional credit arrangements.\nWe believe that the rate of inflation over the past few years has not had a significant adverse impact on our net sales or income from continuing operations.\nFinancing Arrangements Related to the Acquisition of Hudson, the Merger and the Merger Transactions\nConvertible Notes\nWe issued Convertible Notes in connection with the acquisition of Hudson with different interest rates and conversion features for Hudson's management stockholders and Fireman, respectively. Interest on the Convertible Notes was paid in a combination of cash and additional paid-in-kind notes, or PIK notes. All of the Convertible Notes were structurally and contractually subordinated to our senior debt and matured on March 31, 2019. All of the notes were expressly junior and subordinated in right of payment to all amounts due and owing upon any indebtedness outstanding under the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement (as discussed below). Due\nto the defaults and events of default under the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement and Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement, we were prohibited from making any payments under the Convertible Notes.\nOn September 8, 2015, we entered into the Rollover Agreement with the holders of our Convertible Notes, pursuant to which, on January 28, 2016, the holders of the Convertible Notes contributed to us the Convertible Notes in exchange for the following:\n\u2022 1,167,317 shares of Common Stock;\n\u2022 a cash payment of approximately $8.6 million, before expenses; and\n\u2022 an aggregate principal amount of approximately $16.5 million of Modified Convertible Notes.\nThe Modified Convertible Notes are structurally and contractually subordinated to our senior debt and will mature on July 28, 2021. The Modified Convertible Notes accrue interest quarterly on the outstanding principal amount at a rate of 6.5% per"}
