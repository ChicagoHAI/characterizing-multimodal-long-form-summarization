Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of, and for, the periods presented. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the sections entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d -Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 6. Selected Historical Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This section and other parts of the Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements regarding the industry outlook, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial and industry trends that may affect our future results of operations or financial condition and other non-historical statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in -Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\ufeff\nOverview\n\ufeff\nWe are a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies. We provide our products and services primarily to E&P companies for use in onshore wells, predominantly wells that have been drilled with horizontal laterals in unconventional oil and natural gas formations. Our products and services are utilized in oil and natural gas basins throughout North America and in selected international markets, including Argentina, China and Russia. We provided our products and services to over 240 customers in 2017, including leading large independent oil and natural gas companies and major oil companies.\n\ufeff\nOur primary offering is our Multistage Unlimited family of completion products and services, which enable efficient pinpoint stimulation: the process of individually stimulating each entry point into a formation targeted by an oil or natural gas well. Our Multistage Unlimited products and services are typically utilized in cemented wellbores and enable our customers to precisely place stimulation treatments in a more controlled and repeatable manner as compared with traditional completion techniques. Our Multistage Unlimited products and services are utilized in conjunction with third-party providers of pressure pumping, coiled tubing and other services.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to our Multistage Unlimited family of completion products and services, we sell other products including our AirLock casing buoyancy system and liner hanger systems. We also provide well completion diagnostics and reservoir characterization services that utilize downhole chemical and radioactive tracers through Spectrum Tracer Services and engineering consulting services through Anderson Thompson Reservoir Strategies. We operate in one reportable segment.\n\ufeff\nMarket Conditions\n\ufeff\nOil and Natural Gas Drilling and Completion Activity\n\ufeff\nOur products and services are primarily sold to North American E&P companies and our ability to generate revenues from our products and services depend upon oil and natural gas drilling and production activity in North America. Oil and natural gas drilling and production activity is directly related to oil and natural gas prices.\n\ufeff\nOver the past several years, North American E&P companies have been able to reduce their cost structures in response to lower oil and natural gas prices and have also utilized technologies, including ours, to increase efficiency and improve well performance. After a period of declining drilling and completion activity from late 2014 through early 2016, North American E&P companies began to increase activity levels beginning in the second quarter of 2016, as evidenced by increasing rig counts in the U.S. and Canada. The average U.S. land rig count improved from 398 in the second quarter of 2016 to 902 in the fourth quarter of 2017, while the average rig count in Canada, which exhibits a higher degree of seasonality than the U.S., increased from 180 in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 203 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Over this time, the demand for our products and services has also increased. On an annual basis, the average U.S. land rig count improved from 486 in 2016 to 856 in 2017, while the average rig count in Canada increased from 128 in 2016 to 205 in 2017.\n\ufeff\nOil and natural gas prices remain volatile, with WTI crude oil pricing falling to a low of approximately $26 per barrel in February 2016 before recovering to approximately $60 per barrel by the end of December 2017. Crude oil pricing has been supported by voluntary oil production reductions by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d), and certain other countries, including Russia. These supply reductions were announced in November 2016 and were initially implemented in 2017. In November 2017, OPEC and certain other countries, including Russia, announced their intent to extend the supply reductions through the end of 2018. There can be no assurance that the countries involved will comply with the intended reductions or the amount of oil supply that may be returned to the market if the supply reductions are not extended beyond the end of 2018. Natural gas pricing reached a low of approximately $1.50 per mmBtu in March 2016 before recovering to an average level of approximately $3.00 per mmBtu during 2017. Realized natural gas prices for Canadian E&P customers are typically at a discount to U.S. Henry Hub pricing.\nSpot pricing for Canadian natural gas at the AECO hub has been volatile since mid-2017, with wider-than-normal discounts to Henry Hub pricing resulting from infrastructure bottlenecks and elevated local storage levels. Some Canadian E&P customers have reacted to the lower prices by shutting in a portion of their natural gas production, negatively impacting their cash flows and planned capital spending and drilling activity. Sustained declines in commodity prices, combined with potential increases in the cost of drilling and completing wells resulting from high utilization in certain oilfield services categories could lead North American E&P companies to reduce drilling and completion activity, which could negatively impact our business.\n\ufeff\nListed and depicted below are recent crude oil and natural gas pricing trends, as provided by the Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Energy:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>

In Canada, we typically experience higher activity levels in the first quarter of each year, as our customers take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In the past, our revenue in Canada has declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions that result in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing drill sites and road bans that curtail drilling and completion activity. Access to well sites typically improves throughout the third and fourth quarters in Canada, leading to activity levels that are higher than in the second quarter, but lower than activity in the first quarter. Our business can also be impacted by a reduction in customer activity during the winter holidays in late December and early January.\nThe average Canadian rig count declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the third quarter, especially in Saskatchewan, where we have significant operations. We believe this reduction in drilling activity was primarily a result of low recent spot natural gas prices, certain customers having exhausted their 2017 capital budgets prior to year-end and typical reductions in activity driven by holidays in the fourth quarter.\n\ufeff\nBased on the current commodity price environment, many U.S. E&P companies have indicated that they expect to increase their drilling and completions budgets in 2018, relative to 2017. In the first quarter of 2018 many E&P and oilfield services companies, including us, have noted instances of supply chain disruptions related to material and labor availability, which have resulted in what are expected to be temporary delays in planned drilling and completion activity. The market in Canada continues to be impacted by logistical constraints in moving oil and natural gas from areas of production activity to demand centers. These constraints have led to lower realized pricing for our Canadian customers, especially those that sell natural gas into the local market. As a result, industry capital spending in Canada in 2018 is currently forecast to be in line with or below 2017 levels, with higher spending by producers of oil and liquids-rich natural gas offset by declines by producers of natural gas. During the first nine weeks of 2018, the average land drilling rig count in Canada, as provided by Baker Hughes, has been seven percent lower than during the same period in 2017. We expect that we will be able to leverage our technologically differentiated product and service offering to continue to grow our business in 2018, especially in the United States, where industry activity is expected to grow and where we have greater opportunities for further market share penetration.\n\ufeff\nIncreasing Adoption of Pinpoint Stimulation\n\ufeff\nTraditional well completion techniques, including plug and perf and ball drop, currently account for the majority of unconventional well completions in North America. We believe that pinpoint stimulation provides substantial benefits compared to these traditional well completion techniques and that pinpoint stimulation has become increasingly utilized by operators in North America, particularly in Canada. Our ability to grow our market share, as evidenced by the percentage of horizontal wells in North America completed using our products and services, will depend in large part on the industry's continued adoption of pinpoint stimulation to complete wells.\n\ufeff\nIncreasing Well Complexity and Focus on Completion Optimization\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, E&P companies have drilled longer horizontal wells and completed more hydraulic fracturing stages per well to maximize the volume of hydrocarbon recoveries per well. This trend towards more complex wells has resulted in us selling more sleeves per well on average, which increases our revenue opportunity per well completion. Additionally, E&P companies have become increasingly focused on well productivity through optimization of completion designs and we believe this trend may further the adoption of pinpoint stimulation, and in turn, increase the opportunity for sales of our products and services if our customers observe operational benefits and long-term production results from the application of pinpoint stimulation. This trend towards more complex well completions has also resulted in increased use of tracer diagnostics services, which can be utilized to assess the effectiveness of various well completion techniques in support of completion optimization efforts.\n\ufeff\nAcquisitions\n\ufeff\nOn August 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Spectrum in exchange for approximately $83 million. Spectrum offers chemical and radioactive tracer diagnostics services that our customers utilize to better characterize their assets and to optimize completion designs. Chemical and radioactive tracer studies may provide a cost-effective and reliable means to determine the production profile along a lateral, assess fluid and proppant communication between wells during completions and determine stage and cluster level efficiency of completion designs. We believe Spectrum's tracer diagnostics services strengthens our ability to provide our customers with actionable data and analysis to optimize oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies.\n\ufeff\nOn February 1, 2017, we acquired a 50% interest in Repeat Precision for $6.0 million. Repeat Precision has historically been a supplier to NCS. Our strategic purchase of 50% of this business ensures that we have continued access to their machining services and allows us greater control of the allocation of Repeat Precision's capacity, ensuring that we can scale their operations together with ours. In addition, Repeat Precision also markets certain completion products on a wholesale basis, providing an additional revenue opportunity.\nIn connection with both the Repeat Precision and Spectrum acquisitions, we may need to pay the respective sellers additional consideration as part of an earn-out upon meeting certain specified targets. For additional information regarding our 2017 acquisitions, see Note. 3 Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nHow We Generate Revenues\n\ufeff\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of our Multistage Unlimited products and the provision of related services. The remainder of our revenues are generated from sales of our AirLock casing buoyancy system, our liner hanger systems and services provided by Spectrum and Anderson Thompson Reservoir Strategies. Our joint venture, Repeat, generates revenue through the provision of third-party manufacturing services and the sale of composite bridge plugs.\n\ufeff\nProduct sales represented approximately 72%, 74% and 70% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Most of our sales are on a just-in-time basis, as specified in individual purchase orders, with a fixed price for our sliding sleeves. We occasionally supply our customers with large orders that may be filled on negotiated terms. Services represented 28%, 26% and 30% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Services include our tool charges and associated services related to our Multistage Unlimited offering and our tracer diagnostics services (which are classified together as services\u201d in our financial results). Services are provided at agreed rates we charge to our customers for the provision of our downhole frac isolation assembly, our personnel and for the provision of tracer diagnostics services.\n\ufeff\nDuring periods of low drilling and well completion activity we will, in certain instances, lower the prices of our products and services. Our revenues are also impacted by well complexity, with wells with more stages resulting in longer jobs and increased revenue attributable to selling more sliding sleeves and the provision of our services.\n\ufeff\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 63%, 71% and 66%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales in Canada and were denominated in Canadian dollars. Because our Canadian contracts are typically invoiced in Canadian dollars, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are regularly monitored.\n\ufeff\nAlthough most of our sales are to North American E&P companies, we do have sales to customers outside of North America and expect sales to international customers to increase over time. These international sales are typically made to our local operating partners on a free on board basis with a point of sale in the United States. Some of the locations in which we have operating partners or sales representatives include Argentina, China, Russia and the Middle East. Our operating partners and representatives do not have authority to contractually bind our company, but market our products in their respective territories as part of their product or service offering.\n\ufeff\nCosts of Conducting our Business\n\ufeff\nOur cost of sales is comprised of expenses relating to the manufacture of our products in addition to the costs of our support services. Manufacturing cost of sales includes payments made to our suppliers for raw materials and payments made to machine shops for the manufacturing of components used in our products and costs related to our employees that perform quality control analysis, assemble and test our products. During the first quarter of 2017, we entered into our joint venture, Repeat Precision, which we believe will allow us to reduce our costs for certain product categories. We review forecasted activity levels in our business and either directly procure or ensure that our vendors procure the required raw materials with sufficient lead time to meet our business requirements. On March 8, 2018, the Trump Administration signed an order that will impose an import tariff of 25% on steel. While we and our suppliers have locked in pricing for certain raw materials required to support our anticipated business activity during 2018, we anticipate that the tariff could result in an increase in our cost of sales, beginning as early as the second quarter. We expect to have success in passing through some, if not all, increases in raw material costs directly resulting from the tariff to our customers, however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Cost of sales for support services includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for employees who provide direct revenue generating services to customers in addition to the costs incurred by these employees for travel and subsistence while on site. Cost of sales includes other variable manufacturing costs, such as shrinkage, obsolescence and revaluation or scrap related to our existing inventory and costs related to the chemicals and laboratory analysis associated with our tracer diagnostics services.\n\ufeff\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of compensation expense, which includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for our employees who are not directly involved in revenue generating activities, including those involved in our research and development activities, as well as our general operating costs. These general operating costs include, but are not limited to: rent and occupancy for our facilities, information technology infrastructure, software licensing, advertising and marketing, third party research and development, risk insurance and professional service fees for audit, legal and other consulting services. In 2015 and 2016, in response to decreased demand for our products and services resulting from the decline in E&P activity in our markets, we reduced our headcount and took certain other actions which resulted in restructuring charges, primarily severance expense. As a result of being a public company, our legal, accounting and other expenses have increased and will further increase for costs associated with our compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\ufeff\nThe percentage of our costs, defined as cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, and including SG&A, denominated in Canadian dollars for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, were approximately 32%, 36% and 33%, respectively.\n\ufeff\nHow We Evaluate our Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our results of operations and profitability and include:\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nWe primarily sell our products and services under purchase orders with pricing negotiated on a one-off basis with each customer. Our revenues are generated primarily from the sales of our completion products and from services related to the utilization of our downhole frac isolation assembly as well as from the provision of tracer diagnostics services. We compare our actual revenue performance on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis to our annual budget and to the most recent estimate we have for the relevant period and to applicable market metrics.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\ufeff\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing performance or which, in the case of share-based compensation, are noncash in nature. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that excludes many of the costs associated with our existing capital structure and excludes costs that management believes do not reflect our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA helps to identify trends in the performance of our core ongoing operations by excluding the effects related to (i) noncash items, such as share-based compensation expense, the amortization of intangible assets,\nand realized and unrealized gains associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and (ii) charges that do not relate to our operations, such as interest expense and income tax benefits. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric that management uses to assess the period-to-period performance of our core business operations, as a benchmark for certain performance-based compensation awards and to compare our operating performance to our peers and competitors.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of profitability.\n\ufeff\nFree Cash Flow\n\ufeff\nWe also utilize free cash flow to evaluate the cash generated by our operations and results of operations. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Management believes free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as we have non-discretionary expenditures, including, but not limited to, repayment of outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, that is not deducted in calculating free cash flow.\n\ufeff\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to cash provided by operating activities as a cash flow measurement.\n\ufeff\nTotal Sleeves Sold and Total Wells Completed\n\ufeff\nWe also evaluate our performance using certain key operating data relating to levels of activity in our business, including, the number of wells completed using our technology, and the number of sleeves we sold to our customers. We use the operating metrics described above as measures of performance. Our management also evaluates and manages the performance of our business by comparing our current actual results against budgeted and estimated amounts and industry trends.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations\n\ufeff\nWe made acquisitions in the first quarter and third quarter of 2017. For additional information about these acquisitions, see Note. 3 Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements. Due to these acquisitions, our results of operations for the 2017 periods presented may not be comparable to historical results of operations for the prior periods. The following table summarizes our revenues and expenses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>

December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nRevenues were $201.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volume of sales of our completions products and services due to higher drilling and well completion activity in North America as a result of an improved commodity price environment in 2017 as compared to 2016 as well as the contribution of Repeat Precision and four months of revenue from Spectrum. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $144.7 million as compared to $73.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our service revenue was $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\ufeff\nCost of sales\n\ufeff\nCost of sales was $98.8 million, or 49.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $53.8 million, or 54.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of sales was primarily a result of a higher number of wells completed and a higher volume of product sales as well as the effect of Repeat Precision and four months of cost of sales from Spectrum. Cost of sales were a lower percentage of revenues due to the higher volume of well completions and sliding sleeve and AirLock system sales, resulting in greater absorption of fixed costs. Cost of product sales was $76.3 million or 52.7% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $22.5 million or 39.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cost of product sales was $40.5 million or 55.3% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $13.3 million or 52.7% of service revenue.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the direct result of headcount additions in substantially all functional areas. In addition, there were significant non-capitalizable additional expenses incurred related to our IPO of $2.3 million, subsequent costs related to operating as a public company, expenses related to the acquisitions, the effect of Repeat Precision and four months of operations from Spectrum and an increase in share-based compensation related to the issuance of restricted stock units and amendments to certain stock options that were to vest only in connection with a change of control (the Liquidity Options\u201d) as discussed in Note 11. Share-Based Compensation\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation\n\ufeff\nDepreciation was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is attributable to a higher level of property and equipment, primarily related to our acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nAmortization\n\ufeff\nAmortization was $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of the increase in amortization was due to an increase in amortizable intangible assets related to our acquisitions and the increase in the average exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n\ufeff\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the $5.5 million increase in the fair value of the earn-outs associated with our acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily a result of prepaying our Prior Term Loan in full in May 2017 by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our IPO. The decrease was partially offset by the write-off of the remaining loan fees of $1.4 million associated with the prepayment of the Prior Term Loan and interest expense due to borrowing $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility in August 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther income (expense), net\n\ufeff\nOther income (expense), net was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $45 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other income (expense), net was higher primarily due to the receipt of $0.9 million from an arbitration case that was decided in our favor in February 2017.\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss)\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange gain was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss of $(2.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily due to the impact of the retirement of our foreign currency denominated debt and changes in the foreign currency exchange rates between the periods.\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a benefit of $(8.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our effective income tax rates were 34.1% and 33.0%, respectively. The primary differences between these effective tax rates were due to several offsetting items, including the effects of recording a tax expense for the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Act of $3.9 million, not providing U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. and a tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred tax liability due to the change in our foreign unremitted earnings assertion of $3.9 million. During the first quarter of 2017, we changed our assertion to state that undistributed foreign earnings are indefinitely or permanently reinvested as a result of cash proceeds received from the IPO during May 2017, a portion of which was used to pay off existing debt.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or\nregularly produced. The ultimate impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. We have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million for the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and recorded a mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of $4.4 million. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the recorded amounts. Those adjustments may impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\n\ufeff\nOn a longer term basis, certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act are expected to have a positive impact on our future income tax expense, including the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of the geographic mix of earnings and losses, including discrete tax items, our tax rate has been and will continue to be volatile.\n\ufeff\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nRevenues were $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was a direct result of a decline in the sales of our completions products and services resulting from lower drilling and well completion activity in North America driven by declines in commodity pricing. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $73.2 million as compared to $80.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decreased revenue as compared to the increased sleeve quantity reflects pricing declines per sleeve and a shift in mix to lower-priced sleeve models during the period. Our service revenue was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\ufeff\nCost of sales\n\ufeff\nCost of sales was $53.8 million, or 54.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $54.7 million, or 48.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily a result of a decline in the number of wells completed, partially offset by the higher volume of product sales. The higher percentage of revenues is related to the realized pricing concessions on all product lines in addition to the specific lower pricing related to excess inventory sales made at discounted prices. Offsetting some of these negative effects was improved pricing in conjunction with our strategic decision to manufacture products with a new international vendor in Mexico to produce certain products at a significantly lower cost, which began in the second quarter of 2016. Cost of product sales was $40.5 million or 55.3% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $13.3 million or 52.7% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of product sales was $40.2 million or 50.2% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $14.6 million or 42.9% of service revenue.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was the direct result of headcount reductions in all functional areas, with the exception of engineering. In addition, discretionary spending was reduced to improve profitability during the prolonged market downturn. Offsetting these operating expense reductions were significant additional expenses incurred related to the IPO process.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation\n\ufeff\nDepreciation was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is attributable to the reduction in our fleet of trucks along with a portion of our service tools becoming fully depreciated at the end of 2015.\n\ufeff\nAmortization\n\ufeff\nAmortization was $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The majority of the decrease in amortization was due to the decrease in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to lower average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of a prepayment made on our Term Loan in December 2015 of $40.0 million in addition to a small favorable foreign exchange effect due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar of $0.2 million.\n\ufeff\nOther income (expense) net\n\ufeff\nOther expense, net was $45 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to other income, net of ($0.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange (loss) gain\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange loss was ($2.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a gain of $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was directly due to the change in foreign currency exchange rates between the periods and the effect that the change had on the outstanding balance of debt on our Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility, which is denominated in Canadian dollars, within each respective period.\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\ufeff\nIncome tax benefit was ($8.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a benefit of ($16.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 our effective income tax rates were 33.0% and (137.5%), respectively. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a tax planning strategy implemented in 2015 and the effect of an adjustment of our deferred tax liability on our differences between book value and tax basis in our Canadian subsidiary. The tax planning strategy was a change to the foreign company's year-end to conform to United States income tax reporting.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and proceeds from sales of our equity securities. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $33.8 million and availability under the Senior Secured Credit Facility of $55.0 million. Our total indebtedness was $27.0 million as of December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nOur principal liquidity needs have been, and are expected to continue to be, capital expenditures, working capital, debt service and potential mergers and acquisitions. On February 1, 2017, we contributed $6.0 million in exchange for a 50% interest in a joint venture, Repeat Precision, which was funded from available cash. Concurrent with entering into the joint venture, we made a $3.0 million Term Loan prepayment, also funded from available cash, and the previous owner of the 50% interest repaid in full a $1.0 million promissory note to us. On August 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Spectrum in exchange for approximately $83 million, subject to certain adjustments, which was comprised of approximately $76 million in cash and 0.4 million shares of common stock. The cash portion was funded with available cash and borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Also, in connection with both the Repeat Precision and Spectrum acquisitions, we may need to pay the respective sellers additional consideration as part of an earn-out upon meeting certain specified targets. See Note 3. Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nOn May 3, 2017, we completed our IPO of 9,500,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $17.00 per share. The underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 1,425,000 shares of our common stock from certain selling stockholders and the closing of the over-allotment option occurred on May 3, 2017 concurrently with the closing of the IPO. We received $148.9 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to repay our remaining indebtedness under our Term Loan and used the remaining net proceeds to acquire Spectrum on August 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nWe plan to incur $15.0 million to $18.0 million in capital expenditures in 2018, which includes capital expenditures related to a new enterprise resource planning system and the remainder of the estimated spending for our research and development facility\ndescribed below. We are investing in our owned facility in Canada to create a research and development facility for product development as well as to further demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of our products to our customers. We estimate total spending for the project to be approximately $11 million CAD ($9 million at December 31, 2017), which started in 2017 and will continue in 2018. Our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $5.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively. We believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and potential borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditure and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months.\n\ufeff\nWe anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the proceeds of equity issuances, or a combination thereof. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that funds will be available from additional indebtedness, the capital markets or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which could result in additional expenses or dilution.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows and Free Cash Flow\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>16,114 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>10,684 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,369 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(85,221) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,840) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,221) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>84,033 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(315) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(12,766) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>608 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>201 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,008) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>15,534 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>8,730 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(10,626) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>11,102 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>9,844 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,903 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 183: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The increase in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the $81.2 million funding of two acquisitions. See Note 3. Acquisitions\u201d in our consolidated financial statements. We also incurred an additional $4.2 million of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 in comparison to the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to the growth of our business and capital expenditures for Repeat Precision and Spectrum. The increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million note receivable repayment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.8 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily was due to the funding of a $1.0 million short-term loan to a supply chain partner to support expenditures required for our business activity.\n\ufeff\nFinancing Activities\n\ufeff\nThe net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $84.0 million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to net proceeds of $148.9 million from our IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Additionally, we borrowed $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The increases were partially offset by $89.1 million of note repayments of the Prior Term Loan under our Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nThe net cash used in financing activities was $0.3 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to amortization payments of the Prior Term Loan under our Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nPrior Senior Secured Credit Facility\n\ufeff\nOn August 7, 2014, Pioneer Investment, Inc. and Pioneer Intermediate, Inc., each wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company along with certain of their subsidiaries entered into that certain Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement,\u201d and the facilities thereunder, the Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d). The Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility consisted of a term loan in the original principal amount of $197.6 million CAD (the Prior Term Loan\u201d) and a $27.8 million CAD revolving credit facility (the Prior Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), of which $5.0 million CAD was available for letters of credit and $5.0 million CAD was available for swingline loans. In connection with the IPO, we repaid all outstanding indebtedness under the Prior Term Loan.\n\ufeff\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\n\ufeff\nOn May 4, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Pioneer Investment, Inc., as borrower (the U.S. Borrower\u201d), NCS Multistage Inc., as borrower (the Canadian Borrower\u201d), Pioneer Intermediate, Inc. (together with the Company, the Parent Guarantors\u201d) and the lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as administrative agent in respect of the U.S. Facility (as defined below) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Canadian Branch as administrative agent in respect of the Canadian Facility (as defined below). The Credit Agreement amended and restated the Prior Credit Agreement in its entirety. The Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature on May 4, 2020.\n\ufeff\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility originally consisted of a (i) senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million made available to the U.S. Borrower (the U.S. Facility\u201d), of which up to $5.0 million may be made available for letters of credit and up to $5.0 million may be made available for swingline loans and (ii) senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million made available to the Canadian Borrower (the Canadian Facility\u201d). We entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement on August 31, 2017 (the Amendment\u201d). The Amendment increased the loan commitment available to the U.S. Borrower to $50.0 million from $25.0 million under the U.S. Facility. The loan commitment available under the Canadian Facility remained at $25.0 million. At December 31, 2017, we had $20.0 million in outstanding indebtedness under the U.S. Facility.\n\ufeff\nBorrowings under the U.S. Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars or Euros and bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate or Eurocurrency Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable interest margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Canadian Facility may be made in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars and bear interest at the Canadian (Cdn) Base Rate, Canadian (U.S.) Base Rate, Eurocurrency Rate or Discount Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable interest margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Adjusted Base Rate, Canadian (U.S.) Base Rate and Canadian (Cdn) Base Rate applicable margin will be between 2.25% and 3.00% and\nEurocurrency Rate applicable margin will be between 3.25% and 4.00%, in each case, depending on the Company's leverage ratio. The applicable interest rate at December 31, 2017 was 5.50%.\n\ufeff\nThe obligations of the U.S. Borrower under the U.S. Facility are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantors and each of the other existing and future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of the Company organized under the laws of the United States (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower and such other subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. The obligations of the Canadian Borrower under the Canadian Facility are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower and each of the future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of the Company organized under the laws of the United States and Canada (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower and such subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens.\n\ufeff\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require (i) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with a leverage ratio test set at (A) 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending prior to March 31, 2018 and (B) 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2018, (ii) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with an interest coverage ratio test set at 2.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (iii) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the Canadian Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a Canadian asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00 and (iv) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the U.S. Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a U.S. asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, dividends and other restricted payments, dispositions and transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings under such facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility also have the right upon an event of default thereunder to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings under such facility. Further, following an event of default under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility, the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such facility. If the debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facility were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt or any other debt that may become due as a result of that acceleration.\n\ufeff\nContractual Obligations\n\ufeff\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3- 5 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital lease obligations including interest payments\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,661 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,286 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,179 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>196 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSenior Secured Credit Facility and other debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24,608 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,184 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20,390 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,325 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,456 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,869 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEarn-outs for the acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12,835 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12,835 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax payable related to the 2017 Tax Act (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,157 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>333 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>665 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>665 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,494 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquipment and office operating leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5,597 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,983 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,223 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>391 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>53,183 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>10,242 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>39,161 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,286 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,494 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 186: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe 2017 Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to U.S. tax.

However, if our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to offset such increased\ncosts through price increases. Our inability or failure to offset any such cost increases in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\ufeff\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. The accounting policies that we believe to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and that require the most complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below.\n\ufeff\nRevenue Recognition\n\ufeff\nWe recognize revenue when it is determined that the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized revenue from our largest customer totaling $27.4 million, or 14% of total revenue for the year. Amounts due from this customer included in trade accounts receivable was $2.0 million, or 4% of trade accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2017. No other customer individually accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue during the year ended 2017 or trade receivable accounts balance as of December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized revenue from our largest customer totaling $25.5 million, or 26% of total revenue for the year. Amounts due from this customer included in trade accounts receivable was $7.8 million, or 24% of trade accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2016. No other customer individually accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue during 2016 or trade receivable accounts balance as of December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the same customer accounted for $35.1 million, or approximately 31% of total revenue, and as of December 31, 2015, $4.4 million in trade accounts receivable were due from this customer, or 17% of trade accounts receivable.\n\ufeff\nWe recognize revenue based upon a purchase order, contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that includes a fixed or determinable price, provided that collectability is reasonably assured, but it does not include right of return or other similar provisions or other significant post-delivery obligations. Revenue is recognized for products generally upon installation and when the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. In cases where services are being performed, we generally do not recognize revenue until a job has been completed, which includes a customer signature or acknowledgement and that there are no additional services or future performance obligations required by us. Rates for services are typically priced on a per day, per man-hour or similar basis that include both the cost of the downhole frac isolation assembly and our personnel required to supervise the operation of the assembly.\n\ufeff\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\ufeff\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Earnings are charged with a provision for doubtful accounts based on a current review of the collectability of customer accounts by management. Such allowances are based upon several factors including, but not limited to, credit approval practices, industry and customer historical experience as well as the current and projected financial condition of the specific customer. Accounts deemed uncollectible are applied against the allowance for doubtful accounts. We have recorded $11 thousand and $0.1 million in provisions for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\ufeff\nInventories\n\ufeff\nInventories consist primarily of raw material, sliding sleeve components, assembled sliding sleeves, certain components used to internally construct our frac isolation assemblies and chemicals, in raw material or finished goods, used for frac diagnostics testing and reporting. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is determined at standard costs approximating the first-in first-out basis with the exception of chemical costs, which are determined using average costing. We continuously evaluate inventories, based on an analysis of inventory levels, historical sales experience and future sales forecasts, to determine obsolete, slow-moving and excess inventory. Adjustments to reduce such inventory to its estimated recoverable value have been recorded by management as an adjustment to cost of sales.\n\ufeff\nProperty and Equipment\n\ufeff\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Equipment held under capital leases are stated at the present value of minimum lease payments. Expenditures for property and equipment and for items which substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets are capitalized at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful life utilizing the straight-line method.\nRoutine expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements and property under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the remaining lease term or useful life of the related asset. Depreciation expense includes amortization of assets under capital leases. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are recognized in other (expense) income, net in the year of disposal.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation on property and equipment, including assets held under capital leases, is calculated using the straight-line method over the following useful service lives or lease term (which includes reasonably assured renewal periods):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBuildings\n</td> <td>30 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBuilding equipment\n</td> <td>5 - 15 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMachinery and equipment\n</td> <td>5 - 12 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFurniture and fixtures\n</td> <td>3 - 5 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComputers and software\n</td> <td>3 - 5 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVehicles and rental equipment\n</td> <td>3 - 4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLeasehold improvements\n</td> <td>\nLease term (1-4)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nWe periodically assess potential impairment of our property and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our overall valuation calculation using forward looking as well as historical computations to measure the value of our long-lived assets. If the overall valuation results are less than the carrying value of such assets, an impairment loss with respect to property and equipment is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. No impairment loss has been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\ufeff\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\ufeff\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) ASC 805, Business Combinations. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total consideration transferred in connection with the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on their fair values. Goodwill acquired in connection with business combinations represents the excess of consideration transferred over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in evaluating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These estimates may be affected by factors such as changing market conditions, technological advances in the oil and natural gas industry or changes in regulations governing that industry. The most significant assumptions requiring judgment involve identifying and estimating the fair value of intangible assets and the associated useful lives for establishing amortization periods. To finalize purchase accounting for significant acquisitions, we utilize the services of independent valuation specialists to assist in the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible assets.\n\ufeff\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, that we incur in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\n\ufeff\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled.\n\ufeff\nFor goodwill, an assessment for impairment is performed annually or, more frequently, when there is an indication an impairment may have occurred. We complete our annual impairment test for goodwill using an assessment date in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets (including allocated goodwill) to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of estimates and assumptions. The principal estimates and assumptions that we use include revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital, a terminal growth rate, and future market conditions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments are reasonable. Any impairment losses are reflected in operating income. We concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in 2017, 2016 or 2015, based on our annual impairment analysis.\n\ufeff\nAll identifiable intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life or term of related agreements. Deferred loan costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. These assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. We concluded there was no impairment of identifiable intangibles for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nNCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. is taxed as a corporation as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. The liability method is used in accounting for deferred income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. The realizability of deferred tax assets is evaluated annually and a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not give rise to future benefits. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, based upon technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities. If the income tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded in the consolidated financial statements equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon its ultimate settlement. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the valuation allowance was $18 thousand and $63 thousand, respectively. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in other income (expense). During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.2 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in interest and penalties. We had $0.6 million and $0.4 million in interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\ufeff\nOne of our Canadian subsidiaries guaranteed the credit facilities of our U.S. entities until May 2017 when cash proceeds were received from the IPO, a portion of which was used to pay off the existing debt. Under U.S. federal income tax rules, this guarantee resulted in all of the earnings and profits of our Canadian subsidiary being subject to current U.S. tax. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act and a change in our permanent earnings reinvestment assertion, we have recognized a U.S. tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred tax liability on a portion of our differences between book value and tax basis in our Canadian subsidiary for which we are now asserting indefinite reinvestment. No U.S. deferred tax liabilities have been recognized on the differences between book value and tax basis that we continue to indefinitely reinvest. Upon reversal of these book value and tax basis differences through dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. It is not practical, however, to estimate the amount of taxes that may be payable on the eventual remittance of these temporary differences after consideration of available foreign tax credits.\n\ufeff\nWe completed our analysis of our tax positions and believe there are no material uncertain tax positions that would require derecognition in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. We believe that there are no tax positions taken or expected to be taken that would significantly increase or decrease unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months following the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no material amounts that had been accrued with respect to uncertain tax positions.\n\ufeff\nWe file income tax returns in the United States, Canada and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. income tax returns for 2011 and subsequent years remain open for examination. The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) commenced an examination of our United States income tax returns for 2011 through 2012 in the first quarter of 2014 which was completed in 2015. No tax adjustments were proposed. Additionally, subsequent to December 31, 2015, the IRS commenced an examination of our United States income tax return for 2014 in the second quarter of 2016, which was completed in 2017. No tax adjustments were proposed.\n\ufeff\nShare-Based Compensation\n\ufeff\nWe account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation- Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d). We recognize compensation cost for all share-based payment transactions with employees, including compensation cost associated with the grant of options and restricted stock units for our common stock using the Black-Scholes model for options and the market price of the common stock on the date of the grant for the restricted stock units. Expense is recognized ratably from one to five years based upon the requisite service period. We also have an employee stock purchase plan, which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock. The purchase price of the stock will be 85% of the lower of the stock price at the beginning or end of the plan period. The fair value of the employees' purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plan will be estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model for both options and the shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan requires assumptions and estimates for inputs, especially the estimate of volatility, that affect the resultant values and hence the amount of compensation expense recognized. Prior to our IPO, we were a private company. Therefore, we estimated our expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our own traded stock price.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe following table presents the timing of service based options granted, number of underlying shares and related exercise prices of stock options granted between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017, along with the fair value per share of common stock utilized to calculate share-based compensation expense.\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nDetermining fair market value\n\ufeff\nDetermining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of options requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of the price of our stock, the risk-free rate, the expected term of the options and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. We estimate the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires estimates of key assumptions based on both historical information and management judgment regarding market factors and trends.\n\ufeff\nExpected volatility-We developed our expected volatility by using the historical volatilities of our peer group of public companies for a period equal to the expected life of the option by taking the median of the annualized weekly ten year standard deviation of their stock prices.\n\ufeff\nRisk-free interest rate-The risk-free interest rates for options granted are based on the constant maturity Treasury bond rates whose term is consistent with the expected life of an option from the date of grant.\n\ufeff\nExpected term-As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted, we based our expected term for awards issued to employees on the simplified\u201d method under the provisions of ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The expected term is based on the midpoint between the vesting date and contractual term of an option. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding.\n\ufeff\nExpected dividend yield-We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero.\n\ufeff\nThe fair value of each option granted in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes- Merton method, with the following weighted average assumptions being used:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected volatility\n</td> <td>44.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n42-44.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>43.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage risk free interest rate\n</td> <td>2.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected term (in years)\n</td> <td>6.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected dividends\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nIn conjunction with the stock options issued above, we also issued Liquidity Options. In connection with the IPO, the Liquidity Options were amended for 22 employees to provide that such awards will vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the consummation of our IPO, which occurred on May 3, 2017, subject to certain requirements including, as applicable, the recipient's continued employment on the vesting date. The Liquidity Options are still subject to accelerated vesting upon a company sale, as defined in our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan. The unamortized compensation expense of the Liquidity Options is being recognized over a period of three years from the date of the modification.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of the modification, we estimated the fair value of the Liquidity Options on April 27, 2017, the amendment date, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which required estimates of key assumptions based on both historical information and management judgment regarding market factors and trends. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Liquidity Options were as follows:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected volatility\n</td> <td>44.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage risk free interest rate\n</td> <td>1.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected term (in years)\n</td> <td>4.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected dividends\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nUpon completion of the IPO, we began granting restricted stock units. All restricted stock units vest ratably over a period of one to three years. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we granted 167,494 restricted stock units at a weighted average grant date fair value of $18.78 of which 57,348 restricted stock units were granted to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The fair value of restricted stock units issued subsequent to the IPO is based on the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ on the grant date.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2017, the total unamortized compensation expense was valued at $16.0 million compared to $11.7 million and $12.7 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of, and for, the periods presented. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the sections entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d -Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 6. Selected Historical Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This section and other parts of the Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements regarding the industry outlook, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial and industry trends that may affect our future results of operations or financial condition and other non-historical statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in -Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\ufeff\nOverview\n\ufeff\nWe are a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies. We provide our products and services primarily to E&P companies for use in onshore wells, predominantly wells that have been drilled with horizontal laterals in unconventional oil and natural gas formations. Our products and services are utilized in oil and natural gas basins throughout North America and in selected international markets, including Argentina, China and Russia. We provided our products and services to over 240 customers in 2017, including leading large independent oil and natural gas companies and major oil companies.\n\ufeff\nOur primary offering is our Multistage Unlimited family of completion products and services, which enable efficient pinpoint stimulation: the process of individually stimulating each entry point into a formation targeted by an oil or natural gas well. Our Multistage Unlimited products and services are typically utilized in cemented wellbores and enable our customers to precisely place stimulation treatments in a more controlled and repeatable manner as compared with traditional completion techniques. Our Multistage Unlimited products and services are utilized in conjunction with third-party providers of pressure pumping, coiled tubing and other services.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to our Multistage Unlimited family of completion products and services, we sell other products including our AirLock casing buoyancy system and liner hanger systems. We also provide well completion diagnostics and reservoir characterization services that utilize downhole chemical and radioactive tracers through Spectrum Tracer Services and engineering consulting services through Anderson Thompson Reservoir Strategies. We operate in one reportable segment.\n\ufeff\nMarket Conditions\n\ufeff\nOil and Natural Gas Drilling and Completion Activity\n\ufeff\nOur products and services are primarily sold to North American E&P companies and our ability to generate revenues from our products and services depend upon oil and natural gas drilling and production activity in North America. Oil and natural gas drilling and production activity is directly related to oil and natural gas prices.\n\ufeff\nOver the past several years, North American E&P companies have been able to reduce their cost structures in response to lower oil and natural gas prices and have also utilized technologies, including ours, to increase efficiency and improve well performance. After a period of declining drilling and completion activity from late 2014 through early 2016, North American E&P companies began to increase activity levels beginning in the second quarter of 2016, as evidenced by increasing rig counts in the U.S. and Canada. The average U.S. land rig count improved from 398 in the second quarter of 2016 to 902 in the fourth quarter of 2017, while the average rig count in Canada, which exhibits a higher degree of seasonality than the U.S., increased from 180 in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 203 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Over this time, the demand for our products and services has also increased. On an annual basis, the average U.S. land rig count improved from 486 in 2016 to 856 in 2017, while the average rig count in Canada increased from 128 in 2016 to 205 in 2017.\n\ufeff\nOil and natural gas prices remain volatile, with WTI crude oil pricing falling to a low of approximately $26 per barrel in February 2016 before recovering to approximately $60 per barrel by the end of December 2017. Crude oil pricing has been supported by voluntary oil production reductions by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d), and certain other countries, including Russia. These supply reductions were announced in November 2016 and were initially implemented in 2017. In November 2017, OPEC and certain other countries, including Russia, announced their intent to extend the supply reductions through the end of 2018. There can be no assurance that the countries involved will comply with the intended reductions or the amount of oil supply that may be returned to the market if the supply reductions are not extended beyond the end of 2018. Natural gas pricing reached a low of approximately $1.50 per mmBtu in March 2016 before recovering to an average level of approximately $3.00 per mmBtu during 2017. Realized natural gas prices for Canadian E&P customers are typically at a discount to U.S. Henry Hub pricing.\nSpot pricing for Canadian natural gas at the AECO hub has been volatile since mid-2017, with wider-than-normal discounts to Henry Hub pricing resulting from infrastructure bottlenecks and elevated local storage levels. Some Canadian E&P customers have reacted to the lower prices by shutting in a portion of their natural gas production, negatively impacting their cash flows and planned capital spending and drilling activity. Sustained declines in commodity prices, combined with potential increases in the cost of drilling and completing wells resulting from high utilization in certain oilfield services categories could lead North American E&P companies to reduce drilling and completion activity, which could negatively impact our business.\n\ufeff\nListed and depicted below are recent crude oil and natural gas pricing trends, as provided by the Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Energy:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nListed and depicted below are the average number of operating onshore rigs in the U.S. and in Canada per quarter since the first quarter of 2015, as provided by Baker Hughes:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nA substantial portion of our business is subject to quarterly variability. In Canada, we typically experience higher activity levels in the first quarter of each year, as our customers take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In the past, our revenue in Canada has declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions that result in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing drill sites and road bans that curtail drilling and completion activity. Access to well sites typically improves throughout the third and fourth quarters in Canada, leading to activity levels that are higher than in the second quarter, but lower than activity in the first quarter. Our business can also be impacted by a reduction in customer activity during the winter holidays in late December and early January.\nThe average Canadian rig count declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the third quarter, especially in Saskatchewan, where we have significant operations. We believe this reduction in drilling activity was primarily a result of low recent spot natural gas prices, certain customers having exhausted their 2017 capital budgets prior to year-end and typical reductions in activity driven by holidays in the fourth quarter.\n\ufeff\nBased on the current commodity price environment, many U.S. E&P companies have indicated that they expect to increase their drilling and completions budgets in 2018, relative to 2017. In the first quarter of 2018 many E&P and oilfield services companies, including us, have noted instances of supply chain disruptions related to material and labor availability, which have resulted in what are expected to be temporary delays in planned drilling and completion activity. The market in Canada continues to be impacted by logistical constraints in moving oil and natural gas from areas of production activity to demand centers. These constraints have led to lower realized pricing for our Canadian customers, especially those that sell natural gas into the local market. As a result, industry capital spending in Canada in 2018 is currently forecast to be in line with or below 2017 levels, with higher spending by producers of oil and liquids-rich natural gas offset by declines by producers of natural gas. During the first nine weeks of 2018, the average land drilling rig count in Canada, as provided by Baker Hughes, has been seven percent lower than during the same period in 2017. We expect that we will be able to leverage our technologically differentiated product and service offering to continue to grow our business in 2018, especially in the United States, where industry activity is expected to grow and where we have greater opportunities for further market share penetration.\n\ufeff\nIncreasing Adoption of Pinpoint Stimulation\n\ufeff\nTraditional well completion techniques, including plug and perf and ball drop, currently account for the majority of unconventional well completions in North America. We believe that pinpoint stimulation provides substantial benefits compared to these traditional well completion techniques and that pinpoint stimulation has become increasingly utilized by operators in North America, particularly in Canada. Our ability to grow our market share, as evidenced by the percentage of horizontal wells in North America completed using our products and services, will depend in large part on the industry's continued adoption of pinpoint stimulation to complete wells.\n\ufeff\nIncreasing Well Complexity and Focus on Completion Optimization\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, E&P companies have drilled longer horizontal wells and completed more hydraulic fracturing stages per well to maximize the volume of hydrocarbon recoveries per well. This trend towards more complex wells has resulted in us selling more sleeves per well on average, which increases our revenue opportunity per well completion. Additionally, E&P companies have become increasingly focused on well productivity through optimization of completion designs and we believe this trend may further the adoption of pinpoint stimulation, and in turn, increase the opportunity for sales of our products and services if our customers observe operational benefits and long-term production results from the application of pinpoint stimulation. This trend towards more complex well completions has also resulted in increased use of tracer diagnostics services, which can be utilized to assess the effectiveness of various well completion techniques in support of completion optimization efforts.\n\ufeff\nAcquisitions\n\ufeff\nOn August 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Spectrum in exchange for approximately $83 million. Spectrum offers chemical and radioactive tracer diagnostics services that our customers utilize to better characterize their assets and to optimize completion designs. Chemical and radioactive tracer studies may provide a cost-effective and reliable means to determine the production profile along a lateral, assess fluid and proppant communication between wells during completions and determine stage and cluster level efficiency of completion designs. We believe Spectrum's tracer diagnostics services strengthens our ability to provide our customers with actionable data and analysis to optimize oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies.\n\ufeff\nOn February 1, 2017, we acquired a 50% interest in Repeat Precision for $6.0 million. Repeat Precision has historically been a supplier to NCS. Our strategic purchase of 50% of this business ensures that we have continued access to their machining services and allows us greater control of the allocation of Repeat Precision's capacity, ensuring that we can scale their operations together with ours. In addition, Repeat Precision also markets certain completion products on a wholesale basis, providing an additional revenue opportunity.\nIn connection with both the Repeat Precision and Spectrum acquisitions, we may need to pay the respective sellers additional consideration as part of an earn-out upon meeting certain specified targets. For additional information regarding our 2017 acquisitions, see Note. 3 Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nHow We Generate Revenues\n\ufeff\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of our Multistage Unlimited products and the provision of related services. The remainder of our revenues are generated from sales of our AirLock casing buoyancy system, our liner hanger systems and services provided by Spectrum and Anderson Thompson Reservoir Strategies. Our joint venture, Repeat, generates revenue through the provision of third-party manufacturing services and the sale of composite bridge plugs.\n\ufeff\nProduct sales represented approximately 72%, 74% and 70% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Most of our sales are on a just-in-time basis, as specified in individual purchase orders, with a fixed price for our sliding sleeves. We occasionally supply our customers with large orders that may be filled on negotiated terms. Services represented 28%, 26% and 30% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Services include our tool charges and associated services related to our Multistage Unlimited offering and our tracer diagnostics services (which are classified together as services\u201d in our financial results). Services are provided at agreed rates we charge to our customers for the provision of our downhole frac isolation assembly, our personnel and for the provision of tracer diagnostics services.\n\ufeff\nDuring periods of low drilling and well completion activity we will, in certain instances, lower the prices of our products and services. Our revenues are also impacted by well complexity, with wells with more stages resulting in longer jobs and increased revenue attributable to selling more sliding sleeves and the provision of our services.\n\ufeff\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 63%, 71% and 66%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales in Canada and were denominated in Canadian dollars. Because our Canadian contracts are typically invoiced in Canadian dollars, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are regularly monitored.\n\ufeff\nAlthough most of our sales are to North American E&P companies, we do have sales to customers outside of North America and expect sales to international customers to increase over time. These international sales are typically made to our local operating partners on a free on board basis with a point of sale in the United States. Some of the locations in which we have operating partners or sales representatives include Argentina, China, Russia and the Middle East. Our operating partners and representatives do not have authority to contractually bind our company, but market our products in their respective territories as part of their product or service offering.\n\ufeff\nCosts of Conducting our Business\n\ufeff\nOur cost of sales is comprised of expenses relating to the manufacture of our products in addition to the costs of our support services. Manufacturing cost of sales includes payments made to our suppliers for raw materials and payments made to machine shops for the manufacturing of components used in our products and costs related to our employees that perform quality control analysis, assemble and test our products. During the first quarter of 2017, we entered into our joint venture, Repeat Precision, which we believe will allow us to reduce our costs for certain product categories. We review forecasted activity levels in our business and either directly procure or ensure that our vendors procure the required raw materials with sufficient lead time to meet our business requirements. On March 8, 2018, the Trump Administration signed an order that will impose an import tariff of 25% on steel. While we and our suppliers have locked in pricing for certain raw materials required to support our anticipated business activity during 2018, we anticipate that the tariff could result in an increase in our cost of sales, beginning as early as the second quarter. We expect to have success in passing through some, if not all, increases in raw material costs directly resulting from the tariff to our customers, however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Cost of sales for support services includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for employees who provide direct revenue generating services to customers in addition to the costs incurred by these employees for travel and subsistence while on site. Cost of sales includes other variable manufacturing costs, such as shrinkage, obsolescence and revaluation or scrap related to our existing inventory and costs related to the chemicals and laboratory analysis associated with our tracer diagnostics services.\n\ufeff\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of compensation expense, which includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for our employees who are not directly involved in revenue generating activities, including those involved in our research and development activities, as well as our general operating costs. These general operating costs include, but are not limited to: rent and occupancy for our facilities, information technology infrastructure, software licensing, advertising and marketing, third party research and development, risk insurance and professional service fees for audit, legal and other consulting services. In 2015 and 2016, in response to decreased demand for our products and services resulting from the decline in E&P activity in our markets, we reduced our headcount and took certain other actions which resulted in restructuring charges, primarily severance expense. As a result of being a public company, our legal, accounting and other expenses have increased and will further increase for costs associated with our compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\ufeff\nThe percentage of our costs, defined as cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, and including SG&A, denominated in Canadian dollars for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, were approximately 32%, 36% and 33%, respectively.\n\ufeff\nHow We Evaluate our Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our results of operations and profitability and include:\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nWe primarily sell our products and services under purchase orders with pricing negotiated on a one-off basis with each customer. Our revenues are generated primarily from the sales of our completion products and from services related to the utilization of our downhole frac isolation assembly as well as from the provision of tracer diagnostics services. We compare our actual revenue performance on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis to our annual budget and to the most recent estimate we have for the relevant period and to applicable market metrics.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\ufeff\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing performance or which, in the case of share-based compensation, are noncash in nature. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that excludes many of the costs associated with our existing capital structure and excludes costs that management believes do not reflect our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA helps to identify trends in the performance of our core ongoing operations by excluding the effects related to (i) noncash items, such as share-based compensation expense, the amortization of intangible assets,\nand realized and unrealized gains associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and (ii) charges that do not relate to our operations, such as interest expense and income tax benefits. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric that management uses to assess the period-to-period performance of our core business operations, as a benchmark for certain performance-based compensation awards and to compare our operating performance to our peers and competitors.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of profitability.\n\ufeff\nFree Cash Flow\n\ufeff\nWe also utilize free cash flow to evaluate the cash generated by our operations and results of operations. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Management believes free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as we have non-discretionary expenditures, including, but not limited to, repayment of outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, that is not deducted in calculating free cash flow.\n\ufeff\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to cash provided by operating activities as a cash flow measurement.\n\ufeff\nTotal Sleeves Sold and Total Wells Completed\n\ufeff\nWe also evaluate our performance using certain key operating data relating to levels of activity in our business, including, the number of wells completed using our technology, and the number of sleeves we sold to our customers. We use the operating metrics described above as measures of performance. Our management also evaluates and manages the performance of our business by comparing our current actual results against budgeted and estimated amounts and industry trends.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations\n\ufeff\nWe made acquisitions in the first quarter and third quarter of 2017. For additional information about these acquisitions, see Note. 3 Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements. Due to these acquisitions, our results of operations for the 2017 periods presented may not be comparable to historical results of operations for the prior periods. The following table summarizes our revenues and expenses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nRevenues were $201.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volume of sales of our completions products and services due to higher drilling and well completion activity in North America as a result of an improved commodity price environment in 2017 as compared to 2016 as well as the contribution of Repeat Precision and four months of revenue from Spectrum. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $144.7 million as compared to $73.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our service revenue was $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\ufeff\nCost of sales\n\ufeff\nCost of sales was $98.8 million, or 49.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $53.8 million, or 54.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of sales was primarily a result of a higher number of wells completed and a higher volume of product sales as well as the effect of Repeat Precision and four months of cost of sales from Spectrum. Cost of sales were a lower percentage of revenues due to the higher volume of well completions and sliding sleeve and AirLock system sales, resulting in greater absorption of fixed costs. Cost of product sales was $76.3 million or 52.7% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $22.5 million or 39.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cost of product sales was $40.5 million or 55.3% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $13.3 million or 52.7% of service revenue.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the direct result of headcount additions in substantially all functional areas. In addition, there were significant non-capitalizable additional expenses incurred related to our IPO of $2.3 million, subsequent costs related to operating as a public company, expenses related to the acquisitions, the effect of Repeat Precision and four months of operations from Spectrum and an increase in share-based compensation related to the issuance of restricted stock units and amendments to certain stock options that were to vest only in connection with a change of control (the Liquidity Options\u201d) as discussed in Note 11. Share-Based Compensation\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation\n\ufeff\nDepreciation was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is attributable to a higher level of property and equipment, primarily related to our acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nAmortization\n\ufeff\nAmortization was $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of the increase in amortization was due to an increase in amortizable intangible assets related to our acquisitions and the increase in the average exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n\ufeff\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the $5.5 million increase in the fair value of the earn-outs associated with our acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily a result of prepaying our Prior Term Loan in full in May 2017 by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our IPO. The decrease was partially offset by the write-off of the remaining loan fees of $1.4 million associated with the prepayment of the Prior Term Loan and interest expense due to borrowing $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility in August 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther income (expense), net\n\ufeff\nOther income (expense), net was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $45 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other income (expense), net was higher primarily due to the receipt of $0.9 million from an arbitration case that was decided in our favor in February 2017.\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss)\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange gain was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss of $(2.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily due to the impact of the retirement of our foreign currency denominated debt and changes in the foreign currency exchange rates between the periods.\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a benefit of $(8.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our effective income tax rates were 34.1% and 33.0%, respectively. The primary differences between these effective tax rates were due to several offsetting items, including the effects of recording a tax expense for the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Act of $3.9 million, not providing U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. and a tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred tax liability due to the change in our foreign unremitted earnings assertion of $3.9 million. During the first quarter of 2017, we changed our assertion to state that undistributed foreign earnings are indefinitely or permanently reinvested as a result of cash proceeds received from the IPO during May 2017, a portion of which was used to pay off existing debt.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or\nregularly produced. The ultimate impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. We have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million for the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and recorded a mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of $4.4 million. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the recorded amounts. Those adjustments may impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\n\ufeff\nOn a longer term basis, certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act are expected to have a positive impact on our future income tax expense, including the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of the geographic mix of earnings and losses, including discrete tax items, our tax rate has been and will continue to be volatile.\n\ufeff\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nRevenues were $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was a direct result of a decline in the sales of our completions products and services resulting from lower drilling and well completion activity in North America driven by declines in commodity pricing. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $73.2 million as compared to $80.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decreased revenue as compared to the increased sleeve quantity reflects pricing declines per sleeve and a shift in mix to lower-priced sleeve models during the period. Our service revenue was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\ufeff\nCost of sales\n\ufeff\nCost of sales was $53.8 million, or 54.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $54.7 million, or 48.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily a result of a decline in the number of wells completed, partially offset by the higher volume of product sales. The higher percentage of revenues is related to the realized pricing concessions on all product lines in addition to the specific lower pricing related to excess inventory sales made at discounted prices. Offsetting some of these negative effects was improved pricing in conjunction with our strategic decision to manufacture products with a new international vendor in Mexico to produce certain products at a significantly lower cost, which began in the second quarter of 2016. Cost of product sales was $40.5 million or 55.3% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $13.3 million or 52.7% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of product sales was $40.2 million or 50.2% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $14.6 million or 42.9% of service revenue.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was the direct result of headcount reductions in all functional areas, with the exception of engineering. In addition, discretionary spending was reduced to improve profitability during the prolonged market downturn. Offsetting these operating expense reductions were significant additional expenses incurred related to the IPO process.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation\n\ufeff\nDepreciation was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is attributable to the reduction in our fleet of trucks along with a portion of our service tools becoming fully depreciated at the end of 2015.\n\ufeff\nAmortization\n\ufeff\nAmortization was $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The majority of the decrease in amortization was due to the decrease in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to lower average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of a prepayment made on our Term Loan in December 2015 of $40.0 million in addition to a small favorable foreign exchange effect due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar of $0.2 million.\n\ufeff\nOther income (expense) net\n\ufeff\nOther expense, net was $45 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to other income, net of ($0.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange (loss) gain\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange loss was ($2.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a gain of $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was directly due to the change in foreign currency exchange rates between the periods and the effect that the change had on the outstanding balance of debt on our Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility, which is denominated in Canadian dollars, within each respective period.\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\ufeff\nIncome tax benefit was ($8.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a benefit of ($16.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 our effective income tax rates were 33.0% and (137.5%), respectively. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a tax planning strategy implemented in 2015 and the effect of an adjustment of our deferred tax liability on our differences between book value and tax basis in our Canadian subsidiary. The tax planning strategy was a change to the foreign company's year-end to conform to United States income tax reporting.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and proceeds from sales of our equity securities. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $33.8 million and availability under the Senior Secured Credit Facility of $55.0 million. Our total indebtedness was $27.0 million as of December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nOur principal liquidity needs have been, and are expected to continue to be, capital expenditures, working capital, debt service and potential mergers and acquisitions. On February 1, 2017, we contributed $6.0 million in exchange for a 50% interest in a joint venture, Repeat Precision, which was funded from available cash. Concurrent with entering into the joint venture, we made a $3.0 million Term Loan prepayment, also funded from available cash, and the previous owner of the 50% interest repaid in full a $1.0 million promissory note to us. On August 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Spectrum in exchange for approximately $83 million, subject to certain adjustments, which was comprised of approximately $76 million in cash and 0.4 million shares of common stock. The cash portion was funded with available cash and borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Also, in connection with both the Repeat Precision and Spectrum acquisitions, we may need to pay the respective sellers additional consideration as part of an earn-out upon meeting certain specified targets. See Note 3. Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nOn May 3, 2017, we completed our IPO of 9,500,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $17.00 per share. The underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 1,425,000 shares of our common stock from certain selling stockholders and the closing of the over-allotment option occurred on May 3, 2017 concurrently with the closing of the IPO. We received $148.9 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to repay our remaining indebtedness under our Term Loan and used the remaining net proceeds to acquire Spectrum on August 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nWe plan to incur $15.0 million to $18.0 million in capital expenditures in 2018, which includes capital expenditures related to a new enterprise resource planning system and the remainder of the estimated spending for our research and development facility\ndescribed below. We are investing in our owned facility in Canada to create a research and development facility for product development as well as to further demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of our products to our customers. We estimate total spending for the project to be approximately $11 million CAD ($9 million at December 31, 2017), which started in 2017 and will continue in 2018. Our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $5.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively. We believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and potential borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditure and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months.\n\ufeff\nWe anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the proceeds of equity issuances, or a combination thereof. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that funds will be available from additional indebtedness, the capital markets or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which could result in additional expenses or dilution.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows and Free Cash Flow\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n_______________\n (1) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Management believes free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as we have non-discretionary expenditures, including, but not limited to, repayment of outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, that are not deducted in calculating free cash flow. A reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to free cash flow for the periods indicated is as follows (in thousands): \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $16.1 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily related to higher net income and higher levels of non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. The increase was partially offset by changes in working capital including higher accounts receivable, inventories and income taxes payable and a decrease in accounts payable.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $10.7 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2016 was primarily related to an increase in business activity in the fourth quarter that resulted in accounts payable, accrued expenses and taxes payable all being higher, along with lower inventory. Offsetting these increases were higher accounts receivables and lower net income for the year.\n\ufeff\nInvesting Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities was $85.2 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the $81.2 million funding of two acquisitions. See Note 3. Acquisitions\u201d in our consolidated financial statements. We also incurred an additional $4.2 million of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 in comparison to the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to the growth of our business and capital expenditures for Repeat Precision and Spectrum. The increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million note receivable repayment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.8 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily was due to the funding of a $1.0 million short-term loan to a supply chain partner to support expenditures required for our business activity.\n\ufeff\nFinancing Activities\n\ufeff\nThe net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $84.0 million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to net proceeds of $148.9 million from our IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Additionally, we borrowed $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The increases were partially offset by $89.1 million of note repayments of the Prior Term Loan under our Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nThe net cash used in financing activities was $0.3 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to amortization payments of the Prior Term Loan under our Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nPrior Senior Secured Credit Facility\n\ufeff\nOn August 7, 2014, Pioneer Investment, Inc. and Pioneer Intermediate, Inc., each wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company along with certain of their subsidiaries entered into that certain Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement,\u201d and the facilities thereunder, the Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d). The Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility consisted of a term loan in the original principal amount of $197.6 million CAD (the Prior Term Loan\u201d) and a $27.8 million CAD revolving credit facility (the Prior Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), of which $5.0 million CAD was available for letters of credit and $5.0 million CAD was available for swingline loans. In connection with the IPO, we repaid all outstanding indebtedness under the Prior Term Loan.\n\ufeff\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\n\ufeff\nOn May 4, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Pioneer Investment, Inc., as borrower (the U.S. Borrower\u201d), NCS Multistage Inc., as borrower (the Canadian Borrower\u201d), Pioneer Intermediate, Inc. (together with the Company, the Parent Guarantors\u201d) and the lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as administrative agent in respect of the U.S. Facility (as defined below) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Canadian Branch as administrative agent in respect of the Canadian Facility (as defined below). The Credit Agreement amended and restated the Prior Credit Agreement in its entirety. The Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature on May 4, 2020.\n\ufeff\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility originally consisted of a (i) senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million made available to the U.S. Borrower (the U.S. Facility\u201d), of which up to $5.0 million may be made available for letters of credit and up to $5.0 million may be made available for swingline loans and (ii) senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million made available to the Canadian Borrower (the Canadian Facility\u201d). We entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement on August 31, 2017 (the Amendment\u201d). The Amendment increased the loan commitment available to the U.S. Borrower to $50.0 million from $25.0 million under the U.S. Facility. The loan commitment available under the Canadian Facility remained at $25.0 million. At December 31, 2017, we had $20.0 million in outstanding indebtedness under the U.S. Facility.\n\ufeff\nBorrowings under the U.S. Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars or Euros and bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate or Eurocurrency Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable interest margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Canadian Facility may be made in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars and bear interest at the Canadian (Cdn) Base Rate, Canadian (U.S.) Base Rate, Eurocurrency Rate or Discount Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable interest margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Adjusted Base Rate, Canadian (U.S.) Base Rate and Canadian (Cdn) Base Rate applicable margin will be between 2.25% and 3.00% and\nEurocurrency Rate applicable margin will be between 3.25% and 4.00%, in each case, depending on the Company's leverage ratio. The applicable interest rate at December 31, 2017 was 5.50%.\n\ufeff\nThe obligations of the U.S. Borrower under the U.S. Facility are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantors and each of the other existing and future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of the Company organized under the laws of the United States (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower and such other subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. The obligations of the Canadian Borrower under the Canadian Facility are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower and each of the future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of the Company organized under the laws of the United States and Canada (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower and such subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens.\n\ufeff\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require (i) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with a leverage ratio test set at (A) 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending prior to March 31, 2018 and (B) 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2018, (ii) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with an interest coverage ratio test set at 2.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (iii) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the Canadian Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a Canadian asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00 and (iv) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the U.S. Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a U.S. asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, dividends and other restricted payments, dispositions and transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings under such facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility also have the right upon an event of default thereunder to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings under such facility. Further, following an event of default under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility, the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such facility. If the debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facility were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt or any other debt that may become due as a result of that acceleration.\n\ufeff\nContractual Obligations\n\ufeff\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n_______________\n (1) The 2017 Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to U.S. tax. The income tax payable related to the 2017 Tax Act is due in installments in varying percentages over the next eight years. \n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\ufeff\nWe have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements with the exception of operating leases.\n\ufeff\nEffects of Inflation\n\ufeff\nWe do not believe that the effects of inflation have had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, if our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to offset such increased\ncosts through price increases. Our inability", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of, and for, the periods presented.

Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\ufeff\nOverview\n\ufeff\nWe are a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies. We provide our products and services primarily to E&P companies for use in onshore wells, predominantly wells that have been drilled with horizontal laterals in unconventional oil and natural gas formations. Our products and services are utilized in oil and natural gas basins throughout North America and in selected international markets, including Argentina, China and Russia. We provided our products and services to over 240 customers in 2017, including leading large independent oil and natural gas companies and major oil companies.\n\ufeff\nOur primary offering is our Multistage Unlimited family of completion products and services, which enable efficient pinpoint stimulation: the process of individually stimulating each entry point into a formation targeted by an oil or natural gas well. Our Multistage Unlimited products and services are typically utilized in cemented wellbores and enable our customers to precisely place stimulation treatments in a more controlled and repeatable manner as compared with traditional completion techniques. Our Multistage Unlimited products and services are utilized in conjunction with third-party providers of pressure pumping, coiled tubing and other services.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to our Multistage Unlimited family of completion products and services, we sell other products including our AirLock casing buoyancy system and liner hanger systems. We also provide well completion diagnostics and reservoir characterization services that utilize downhole chemical and radioactive tracers through Spectrum Tracer Services and engineering consulting services through Anderson Thompson Reservoir Strategies. We operate in one reportable segment.\n\ufeff\nMarket Conditions\n\ufeff\nOil and Natural Gas Drilling and Completion Activity\n\ufeff\nOur products and services are primarily sold to North American E&P companies and our ability to generate revenues from our products and services depend upon oil and natural gas drilling and production activity in North America. Oil and natural gas drilling and production activity is directly related to oil and natural gas prices.\n\ufeff\nOver the past several years, North American E&P companies have been able to reduce their cost structures in response to lower oil and natural gas prices and have also utilized technologies, including ours, to increase efficiency and improve well performance. After a period of declining drilling and completion activity from late 2014 through early 2016, North American E&P companies began to increase activity levels beginning in the second quarter of 2016, as evidenced by increasing rig counts in the U.S. and Canada. The average U.S. land rig count improved from 398 in the second quarter of 2016 to 902 in the fourth quarter of 2017, while the average rig count in Canada, which exhibits a higher degree of seasonality than the U.S., increased from 180 in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 203 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Over this time, the demand for our products and services has also increased. On an annual basis, the average U.S. land rig count improved from 486 in 2016 to 856 in 2017, while the average rig count in Canada increased from 128 in 2016 to 205 in 2017.\n\ufeff\nOil and natural gas prices remain volatile, with WTI crude oil pricing falling to a low of approximately $26 per barrel in February 2016 before recovering to approximately $60 per barrel by the end of December 2017. Crude oil pricing has been supported by voluntary oil production reductions by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d), and certain other countries, including Russia. These supply reductions were announced in November 2016 and were initially implemented in 2017. In November 2017, OPEC and certain other countries, including Russia, announced their intent to extend the supply reductions through the end of 2018. There can be no assurance that the countries involved will comply with the intended reductions or the amount of oil supply that may be returned to the market if the supply reductions are not extended beyond the end of 2018. Natural gas pricing reached a low of approximately $1.50 per mmBtu in March 2016 before recovering to an average level of approximately $3.00 per mmBtu during 2017. Realized natural gas prices for Canadian E&P customers are typically at a discount to U.S. Henry Hub pricing.\nSpot pricing for Canadian natural gas at the AECO hub has been volatile since mid-2017, with wider-than-normal discounts to Henry Hub pricing resulting from infrastructure bottlenecks and elevated local storage levels. Some Canadian E&P customers have reacted to the lower prices by shutting in a portion of their natural gas production, negatively impacting their cash flows and planned capital spending and drilling activity. Sustained declines in commodity prices, combined with potential increases in the cost of drilling and completing wells resulting from high utilization in certain oilfield services categories could lead North American E&P companies to reduce drilling and completion activity, which could negatively impact our business.\n\ufeff\nListed and depicted below are recent crude oil and natural gas pricing trends, as provided by the Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Energy:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>

In Canada, we typically experience higher activity levels in the first quarter of each year, as our customers take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In the past, our revenue in Canada has declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions that result in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing drill sites and road bans that curtail drilling and completion activity. Access to well sites typically improves throughout the third and fourth quarters in Canada, leading to activity levels that are higher than in the second quarter, but lower than activity in the first quarter. Our business can also be impacted by a reduction in customer activity during the winter holidays in late December and early January.\nThe average Canadian rig count declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the third quarter, especially in Saskatchewan, where we have significant operations. We believe this reduction in drilling activity was primarily a result of low recent spot natural gas prices, certain customers having exhausted their 2017 capital budgets prior to year-end and typical reductions in activity driven by holidays in the fourth quarter.\n\ufeff\nBased on the current commodity price environment, many U.S. E&P companies have indicated that they expect to increase their drilling and completions budgets in 2018, relative to 2017. In the first quarter of 2018 many E&P and oilfield services companies, including us, have noted instances of supply chain disruptions related to material and labor availability, which have resulted in what are expected to be temporary delays in planned drilling and completion activity. The market in Canada continues to be impacted by logistical constraints in moving oil and natural gas from areas of production activity to demand centers. These constraints have led to lower realized pricing for our Canadian customers, especially those that sell natural gas into the local market. As a result, industry capital spending in Canada in 2018 is currently forecast to be in line with or below 2017 levels, with higher spending by producers of oil and liquids-rich natural gas offset by declines by producers of natural gas. During the first nine weeks of 2018, the average land drilling rig count in Canada, as provided by Baker Hughes, has been seven percent lower than during the same period in 2017. We expect that we will be able to leverage our technologically differentiated product and service offering to continue to grow our business in 2018, especially in the United States, where industry activity is expected to grow and where we have greater opportunities for further market share penetration.\n\ufeff\nIncreasing Adoption of Pinpoint Stimulation\n\ufeff\nTraditional well completion techniques, including plug and perf and ball drop, currently account for the majority of unconventional well completions in North America. We believe that pinpoint stimulation provides substantial benefits compared to these traditional well completion techniques and that pinpoint stimulation has become increasingly utilized by operators in North America, particularly in Canada. Our ability to grow our market share, as evidenced by the percentage of horizontal wells in North America completed using our products and services, will depend in large part on the industry's continued adoption of pinpoint stimulation to complete wells.\n\ufeff\nIncreasing Well Complexity and Focus on Completion Optimization\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, E&P companies have drilled longer horizontal wells and completed more hydraulic fracturing stages per well to maximize the volume of hydrocarbon recoveries per well. This trend towards more complex wells has resulted in us selling more sleeves per well on average, which increases our revenue opportunity per well completion. Additionally, E&P companies have become increasingly focused on well productivity through optimization of completion designs and we believe this trend may further the adoption of pinpoint stimulation, and in turn, increase the opportunity for sales of our products and services if our customers observe operational benefits and long-term production results from the application of pinpoint stimulation. This trend towards more complex well completions has also resulted in increased use of tracer diagnostics services, which can be utilized to assess the effectiveness of various well completion techniques in support of completion optimization efforts.\n\ufeff\nAcquisitions\n\ufeff\nOn August 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Spectrum in exchange for approximately $83 million. Spectrum offers chemical and radioactive tracer diagnostics services that our customers utilize to better characterize their assets and to optimize completion designs. Chemical and radioactive tracer studies may provide a cost-effective and reliable means to determine the production profile along a lateral, assess fluid and proppant communication between wells during completions and determine stage and cluster level efficiency of completion designs. We believe Spectrum's tracer diagnostics services strengthens our ability to provide our customers with actionable data and analysis to optimize oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies.\n\ufeff\nOn February 1, 2017, we acquired a 50% interest in Repeat Precision for $6.0 million. Repeat Precision has historically been a supplier to NCS. Our strategic purchase of 50% of this business ensures that we have continued access to their machining services and allows us greater control of the allocation of Repeat Precision's capacity, ensuring that we can scale their operations together with ours. In addition, Repeat Precision also markets certain completion products on a wholesale basis, providing an additional revenue opportunity.\nIn connection with both the Repeat Precision and Spectrum acquisitions, we may need to pay the respective sellers additional consideration as part of an earn-out upon meeting certain specified targets. For additional information regarding our 2017 acquisitions, see Note. 3 Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nHow We Generate Revenues\n\ufeff\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of our Multistage Unlimited products and the provision of related services. The remainder of our revenues are generated from sales of our AirLock casing buoyancy system, our liner hanger systems and services provided by Spectrum and Anderson Thompson Reservoir Strategies. Our joint venture, Repeat, generates revenue through the provision of third-party manufacturing services and the sale of composite bridge plugs.\n\ufeff\nProduct sales represented approximately 72%, 74% and 70% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Most of our sales are on a just-in-time basis, as specified in individual purchase orders, with a fixed price for our sliding sleeves. We occasionally supply our customers with large orders that may be filled on negotiated terms. Services represented 28%, 26% and 30% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Services include our tool charges and associated services related to our Multistage Unlimited offering and our tracer diagnostics services (which are classified together as services\u201d in our financial results). Services are provided at agreed rates we charge to our customers for the provision of our downhole frac isolation assembly, our personnel and for the provision of tracer diagnostics services.\n\ufeff\nDuring periods of low drilling and well completion activity we will, in certain instances, lower the prices of our products and services. Our revenues are also impacted by well complexity, with wells with more stages resulting in longer jobs and increased revenue attributable to selling more sliding sleeves and the provision of our services.\n\ufeff\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 63%, 71% and 66%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales in Canada and were denominated in Canadian dollars. Because our Canadian contracts are typically invoiced in Canadian dollars, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are regularly monitored.\n\ufeff\nAlthough most of our sales are to North American E&P companies, we do have sales to customers outside of North America and expect sales to international customers to increase over time. These international sales are typically made to our local operating partners on a free on board basis with a point of sale in the United States. Some of the locations in which we have operating partners or sales representatives include Argentina, China, Russia and the Middle East. Our operating partners and representatives do not have authority to contractually bind our company, but market our products in their respective territories as part of their product or service offering.\n\ufeff\nCosts of Conducting our Business\n\ufeff\nOur cost of sales is comprised of expenses relating to the manufacture of our products in addition to the costs of our support services. Manufacturing cost of sales includes payments made to our suppliers for raw materials and payments made to machine shops for the manufacturing of components used in our products and costs related to our employees that perform quality control analysis, assemble and test our products. During the first quarter of 2017, we entered into our joint venture, Repeat Precision, which we believe will allow us to reduce our costs for certain product categories. We review forecasted activity levels in our business and either directly procure or ensure that our vendors procure the required raw materials with sufficient lead time to meet our business requirements. On March 8, 2018, the Trump Administration signed an order that will impose an import tariff of 25% on steel. While we and our suppliers have locked in pricing for certain raw materials required to support our anticipated business activity during 2018, we anticipate that the tariff could result in an increase in our cost of sales, beginning as early as the second quarter. We expect to have success in passing through some, if not all, increases in raw material costs directly resulting from the tariff to our customers, however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Cost of sales for support services includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for employees who provide direct revenue generating services to customers in addition to the costs incurred by these employees for travel and subsistence while on site. Cost of sales includes other variable manufacturing costs, such as shrinkage, obsolescence and revaluation or scrap related to our existing inventory and costs related to the chemicals and laboratory analysis associated with our tracer diagnostics services.\n\ufeff\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of compensation expense, which includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for our employees who are not directly involved in revenue generating activities, including those involved in our research and development activities, as well as our general operating costs. These general operating costs include, but are not limited to: rent and occupancy for our facilities, information technology infrastructure, software licensing, advertising and marketing, third party research and development, risk insurance and professional service fees for audit, legal and other consulting services. In 2015 and 2016, in response to decreased demand for our products and services resulting from the decline in E&P activity in our markets, we reduced our headcount and took certain other actions which resulted in restructuring charges, primarily severance expense. As a result of being a public company, our legal, accounting and other expenses have increased and will further increase for costs associated with our compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\ufeff\nThe percentage of our costs, defined as cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, and including SG&A, denominated in Canadian dollars for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, were approximately 32%, 36% and 33%, respectively.\n\ufeff\nHow We Evaluate our Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our results of operations and profitability and include:\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nWe primarily sell our products and services under purchase orders with pricing negotiated on a one-off basis with each customer. Our revenues are generated primarily from the sales of our completion products and from services related to the utilization of our downhole frac isolation assembly as well as from the provision of tracer diagnostics services. We compare our actual revenue performance on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis to our annual budget and to the most recent estimate we have for the relevant period and to applicable market metrics.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\ufeff\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing performance or which, in the case of share-based compensation, are noncash in nature. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that excludes many of the costs associated with our existing capital structure and excludes costs that management believes do not reflect our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA helps to identify trends in the performance of our core ongoing operations by excluding the effects related to (i) noncash items, such as share-based compensation expense, the amortization of intangible assets,\nand realized and unrealized gains associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and (ii) charges that do not relate to our operations, such as interest expense and income tax benefits. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric that management uses to assess the period-to-period performance of our core business operations, as a benchmark for certain performance-based compensation awards and to compare our operating performance to our peers and competitors.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of profitability.\n\ufeff\nFree Cash Flow\n\ufeff\nWe also utilize free cash flow to evaluate the cash generated by our operations and results of operations. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Management believes free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as we have non-discretionary expenditures, including, but not limited to, repayment of outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, that is not deducted in calculating free cash flow.\n\ufeff\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to cash provided by operating activities as a cash flow measurement.\n\ufeff\nTotal Sleeves Sold and Total Wells Completed\n\ufeff\nWe also evaluate our performance using certain key operating data relating to levels of activity in our business, including, the number of wells completed using our technology, and the number of sleeves we sold to our customers. We use the operating metrics described above as measures of performance. Our management also evaluates and manages the performance of our business by comparing our current actual results against budgeted and estimated amounts and industry trends.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations\n\ufeff\nWe made acquisitions in the first quarter and third quarter of 2017. For additional information about these acquisitions, see Note. 3 Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements. Due to these acquisitions, our results of operations for the 2017 periods presented may not be comparable to historical results of operations for the prior periods.

December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nRevenues were $201.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volume of sales of our completions products and services due to higher drilling and well completion activity in North America as a result of an improved commodity price environment in 2017 as compared to 2016 as well as the contribution of Repeat Precision and four months of revenue from Spectrum. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $144.7 million as compared to $73.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our service revenue was $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\ufeff\nCost of sales\n\ufeff\nCost of sales was $98.8 million, or 49.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $53.8 million, or 54.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of sales was primarily a result of a higher number of wells completed and a higher volume of product sales as well as the effect of Repeat Precision and four months of cost of sales from Spectrum. Cost of sales were a lower percentage of revenues due to the higher volume of well completions and sliding sleeve and AirLock system sales, resulting in greater absorption of fixed costs. Cost of product sales was $76.3 million or 52.7% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $22.5 million or 39.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cost of product sales was $40.5 million or 55.3% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $13.3 million or 52.7% of service revenue.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the direct result of headcount additions in substantially all functional areas. In addition, there were significant non-capitalizable additional expenses incurred related to our IPO of $2.3 million, subsequent costs related to operating as a public company, expenses related to the acquisitions, the effect of Repeat Precision and four months of operations from Spectrum and an increase in share-based compensation related to the issuance of restricted stock units and amendments to certain stock options that were to vest only in connection with a change of control (the Liquidity Options\u201d) as discussed in Note 11. Share-Based Compensation\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation\n\ufeff\nDepreciation was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is attributable to a higher level of property and equipment, primarily related to our acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nAmortization\n\ufeff\nAmortization was $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of the increase in amortization was due to an increase in amortizable intangible assets related to our acquisitions and the increase in the average exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n\ufeff\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the $5.5 million increase in the fair value of the earn-outs associated with our acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily a result of prepaying our Prior Term Loan in full in May 2017 by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our IPO. The decrease was partially offset by the write-off of the remaining loan fees of $1.4 million associated with the prepayment of the Prior Term Loan and interest expense due to borrowing $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility in August 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther income (expense), net\n\ufeff\nOther income (expense), net was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $45 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other income (expense), net was higher primarily due to the receipt of $0.9 million from an arbitration case that was decided in our favor in February 2017.\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss)\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange gain was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss of $(2.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily due to the impact of the retirement of our foreign currency denominated debt and changes in the foreign currency exchange rates between the periods.\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a benefit of $(8.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our effective income tax rates were 34.1% and 33.0%, respectively. The primary differences between these effective tax rates were due to several offsetting items, including the effects of recording a tax expense for the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Act of $3.9 million, not providing U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. and a tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred tax liability due to the change in our foreign unremitted earnings assertion of $3.9 million. During the first quarter of 2017, we changed our assertion to state that undistributed foreign earnings are indefinitely or permanently reinvested as a result of cash proceeds received from the IPO during May 2017, a portion of which was used to pay off existing debt.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or\nregularly produced. The ultimate impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. We have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million for the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and recorded a mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of $4.4 million. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the recorded amounts. Those adjustments may impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\n\ufeff\nOn a longer term basis, certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act are expected to have a positive impact on our future income tax expense, including the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of the geographic mix of earnings and losses, including discrete tax items, our tax rate has been and will continue to be volatile.\n\ufeff\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nRevenues were $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was a direct result of a decline in the sales of our completions products and services resulting from lower drilling and well completion activity in North America driven by declines in commodity pricing. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $73.2 million as compared to $80.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decreased revenue as compared to the increased sleeve quantity reflects pricing declines per sleeve and a shift in mix to lower-priced sleeve models during the period. Our service revenue was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\ufeff\nCost of sales\n\ufeff\nCost of sales was $53.8 million, or 54.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $54.7 million, or 48.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily a result of a decline in the number of wells completed, partially offset by the higher volume of product sales. The higher percentage of revenues is related to the realized pricing concessions on all product lines in addition to the specific lower pricing related to excess inventory sales made at discounted prices. Offsetting some of these negative effects was improved pricing in conjunction with our strategic decision to manufacture products with a new international vendor in Mexico to produce certain products at a significantly lower cost, which began in the second quarter of 2016. Cost of product sales was $40.5 million or 55.3% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $13.3 million or 52.7% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of product sales was $40.2 million or 50.2% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $14.6 million or 42.9% of service revenue.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was the direct result of headcount reductions in all functional areas, with the exception of engineering. In addition, discretionary spending was reduced to improve profitability during the prolonged market downturn. Offsetting these operating expense reductions were significant additional expenses incurred related to the IPO process.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation\n\ufeff\nDepreciation was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is attributable to the reduction in our fleet of trucks along with a portion of our service tools becoming fully depreciated at the end of 2015.\n\ufeff\nAmortization\n\ufeff\nAmortization was $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The majority of the decrease in amortization was due to the decrease in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to lower average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of a prepayment made on our Term Loan in December 2015 of $40.0 million in addition to a small favorable foreign exchange effect due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar of $0.2 million.\n\ufeff\nOther income (expense) net\n\ufeff\nOther expense, net was $45 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to other income, net of ($0.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange (loss) gain\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange loss was ($2.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a gain of $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was directly due to the change in foreign currency exchange rates between the periods and the effect that the change had on the outstanding balance of debt on our Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility, which is denominated in Canadian dollars, within each respective period.\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\ufeff\nIncome tax benefit was ($8.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a benefit of ($16.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 our effective income tax rates were 33.0% and (137.5%), respectively. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a tax planning strategy implemented in 2015 and the effect of an adjustment of our deferred tax liability on our differences between book value and tax basis in our Canadian subsidiary. The tax planning strategy was a change to the foreign company's year-end to conform to United States income tax reporting.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and proceeds from sales of our equity securities. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $33.8 million and availability under the Senior Secured Credit Facility of $55.0 million. Our total indebtedness was $27.0 million as of December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nOur principal liquidity needs have been, and are expected to continue to be, capital expenditures, working capital, debt service and potential mergers and acquisitions. On February 1, 2017, we contributed $6.0 million in exchange for a 50% interest in a joint venture, Repeat Precision, which was funded from available cash. Concurrent with entering into the joint venture, we made a $3.0 million Term Loan prepayment, also funded from available cash, and the previous owner of the 50% interest repaid in full a $1.0 million promissory note to us. On August 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Spectrum in exchange for approximately $83 million, subject to certain adjustments, which was comprised of approximately $76 million in cash and 0.4 million shares of common stock. The cash portion was funded with available cash and borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Also, in connection with both the Repeat Precision and Spectrum acquisitions, we may need to pay the respective sellers additional consideration as part of an earn-out upon meeting certain specified targets. See Note 3. Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nOn May 3, 2017, we completed our IPO of 9,500,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $17.00 per share. The underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 1,425,000 shares of our common stock from certain selling stockholders and the closing of the over-allotment option occurred on May 3, 2017 concurrently with the closing of the IPO. We received $148.9 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to repay our remaining indebtedness under our Term Loan and used the remaining net proceeds to acquire Spectrum on August 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nWe plan to incur $15.0 million to $18.0 million in capital expenditures in 2018, which includes capital expenditures related to a new enterprise resource planning system and the remainder of the estimated spending for our research and development facility\ndescribed below. We are investing in our owned facility in Canada to create a research and development facility for product development as well as to further demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of our products to our customers. We estimate total spending for the project to be approximately $11 million CAD ($9 million at December 31, 2017), which started in 2017 and will continue in 2018. Our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $5.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively. We believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and potential borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditure and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months.\n\ufeff\nWe anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the proceeds of equity issuances, or a combination thereof. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that funds will be available from additional indebtedness, the capital markets or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which could result in additional expenses or dilution.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows and Free Cash Flow\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>16,114 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>10,684 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,369 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(85,221) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,840) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,221) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>84,033 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(315) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(12,766) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>608 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>201 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,008) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>15,534 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>8,730 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(10,626) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>11,102 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>9,844 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,903 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n (1) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Management believes free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as we have non-discretionary expenditures, including, but not limited to, repayment of outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, that are not deducted in calculating free cash flow. A reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to free cash flow for the periods indicated is as follows (in thousands): \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>16,114 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>10,684 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,369 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(5,366) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,157) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(890) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProceeds from sales of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>354 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>317 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>424 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>11,102 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>9,844 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,903 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $16.1 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily related to higher net income and higher levels of non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. The increase was partially offset by changes in working capital including higher accounts receivable, inventories and income taxes payable and a decrease in accounts payable.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $10.7 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2016 was primarily related to an increase in business activity in the fourth quarter that resulted in accounts payable, accrued expenses and taxes payable all being higher, along with lower inventory. Offsetting these increases were higher accounts receivables and lower net income for the year.\n\ufeff\nInvesting Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities was $85.2 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the $81.2 million funding of two acquisitions. See Note 3. Acquisitions\u201d in our consolidated financial statements. We also incurred an additional $4.2 million of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 in comparison to the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to the growth of our business and capital expenditures for Repeat Precision and Spectrum. The increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million note receivable repayment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.8 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily was due to the funding of a $1.0 million short-term loan to a supply chain partner to support expenditures required for our business activity.\n\ufeff\nFinancing Activities\n\ufeff\nThe net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $84.0 million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to net proceeds of $148.9 million from our IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Additionally, we borrowed $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The increases were partially offset by $89.1 million of note repayments of the Prior Term Loan under our Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nThe net cash used in financing activities was $0.3 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to amortization payments of the Prior Term Loan under our Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nPrior Senior Secured Credit Facility\n\ufeff\nOn August 7, 2014, Pioneer Investment, Inc. and Pioneer Intermediate, Inc., each wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company along with certain of their subsidiaries entered into that certain Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement,\u201d and the facilities thereunder, the Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d). The Prior Senior Secured Credit Facility consisted of a term loan in the original principal amount of $197.6 million CAD (the Prior Term Loan\u201d) and a $27.8 million CAD revolving credit facility (the Prior Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), of which $5.0 million CAD was available for letters of credit and $5.0 million CAD was available for swingline loans. In connection with the IPO, we repaid all outstanding indebtedness under the Prior Term Loan.\n\ufeff\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\n\ufeff\nOn May 4, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Pioneer Investment, Inc., as borrower (the U.S. Borrower\u201d), NCS Multistage Inc., as borrower (the Canadian Borrower\u201d), Pioneer Intermediate, Inc. (together with the Company, the Parent Guarantors\u201d) and the lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as administrative agent in respect of the U.S. Facility (as defined below) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Canadian Branch as administrative agent in respect of the Canadian Facility (as defined below). The Credit Agreement amended and restated the Prior Credit Agreement in its entirety. The Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature on May 4, 2020.\n\ufeff\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility originally consisted of a (i) senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million made available to the U.S. Borrower (the U.S. Facility\u201d), of which up to $5.0 million may be made available for letters of credit and up to $5.0 million may be made available for swingline loans and (ii) senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million made available to the Canadian Borrower (the Canadian Facility\u201d). We entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement on August 31, 2017 (the Amendment\u201d). The Amendment increased the loan commitment available to the U.S. Borrower to $50.0 million from $25.0 million under the U.S. Facility. The loan commitment available under the Canadian Facility remained at $25.0 million. At December 31, 2017, we had $20.0 million in outstanding indebtedness under the U.S. Facility.\n\ufeff\nBorrowings under the U.S. Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars or Euros and bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate or Eurocurrency Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable interest margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Canadian Facility may be made in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars and bear interest at the Canadian (Cdn) Base Rate, Canadian (U.S.) Base Rate, Eurocurrency Rate or Discount Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable interest margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Adjusted Base Rate, Canadian (U.S.) Base Rate and Canadian (Cdn) Base Rate applicable margin will be between 2.25% and 3.00% and\nEurocurrency Rate applicable margin will be between 3.25% and 4.00%, in each case, depending on the Company's leverage ratio. The applicable interest rate at December 31, 2017 was 5.50%.\n\ufeff\nThe obligations of the U.S. Borrower under the U.S. Facility are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantors and each of the other existing and future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of the Company organized under the laws of the United States (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower and such other subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. The obligations of the Canadian Borrower under the Canadian Facility are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower and each of the future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of the Company organized under the laws of the United States and Canada (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower and such subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens.\n\ufeff\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require (i) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with a leverage ratio test set at (A) 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending prior to March 31, 2018 and (B) 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2018, (ii) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with an interest coverage ratio test set at 2.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (iii) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the Canadian Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a Canadian asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00 and (iv) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the U.S. Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a U.S. asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, dividends and other restricted payments, dispositions and transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings under such facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility also have the right upon an event of default thereunder to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings under such facility. Further, following an event of default under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility, the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such facility. If the debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facility were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt or any other debt that may become due as a result of that acceleration.\n\ufeff\nContractual Obligations\n\ufeff\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3- 5 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital lease obligations including interest payments\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,661 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,286 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,179 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>196 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSenior Secured Credit Facility and other debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24,608 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,184 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20,390 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,325 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,456 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,869 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEarn-outs for the acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12,835 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12,835 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax payable related to the 2017 Tax Act (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,157 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>333 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>665 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>665 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,494 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquipment and office operating leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5,597 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,983 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,223 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>391 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>53,183 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>10,242 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>39,161 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,286 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,494 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n (1) The 2017 Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to U.S. tax.
