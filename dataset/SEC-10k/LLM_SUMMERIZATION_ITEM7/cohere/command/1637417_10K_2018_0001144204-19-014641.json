The forward-looking statements and projections contained in this annual report on Form 10-K are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on February 25, 2015 and formally commenced investment operations on January 6, 2016 upon raising the minimum offering requirement from sales of shares of our Class T common stock in our continuous public offering to persons who were not affiliated with us or our former Advisor, FSIC IV Advisor, LLC, or FSIC IV Advisor. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Prior to satisfying the minimum offering requirement, we had no operations except for matters relating to our organization. In November 2017, we closed our continuous public offering of common stock to new investors.\nWe are externally managed by the Advisor pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent. On April 9, 2018, GSO/Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC, or GDFM, resigned as our investment sub-adviser and terminated its investment sub-advisory agreement effective April 9, 2018. In connection with GDFM's resignation as our investment sub-adviser, on April 9, 2018, we entered into the investment advisory and administrative services agreement with the Advisor, which replaced an investment advisory and administrative services agreement, or the FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement, with our former investment adviser, FSIC IV Advisor, LLC, or FSIC IV Advisor.\nOur investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We pursue our investment objective by investing primarily in the debt of middle market U.S. companies with a focus on originated transactions sourced through the network of the Advisor and its affiliates. We define direct originations as any investment where the Advisor or its affiliates negotiates the terms of the transaction beyond just the price, which, for example, may include negotiating financial covenants, maturity dates or interest rate terms. These directly originated transactions include participation in other originated transactions where there may be third parties involved, or a bank acting as an intermediary, for a closely held club, or similar transactions.\nOur portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior secured loans and second lien secured loans of private middle-market U.S. companies and, to a lesser extent, subordinated loans of private U.S. companies. Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be comprised of subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may invest. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the OTC market or directly from our target companies as primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase or otherwise acquire interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity, in our target companies, generally in conjunction with one of our debt investments, including through the restructuring of such investments, or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of corporate bonds, structured products, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. The Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to\nless senior portions of the capital structure or otherwise make opportunistic investments, such as where the market price of loans, bonds or other securities reflects a lower value than deemed warranted by the Advisor's fundamental analysis, which may occur due to general dislocations in the markets, a misunderstanding by the market of a particular company or an industry being out of favor with the broader investment community and may include event driven investments, anchor orders and structured products.\nThe senior secured loans, second lien secured loans and senior secured bonds in which we invest generally have stated terms of three to seven years and subordinated debt investments that we make generally have stated terms of up to ten years, but the expected average life of such securities is generally between three and seven years. However, there is no limit on the maturity or duration of any security in our portfolio. Our debt investments may be rated by a NRSRO and, in such case, generally will carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3\u201d by Moody's or lower than BBB-\u201d by S&P). We also invest in non-rated debt securities.\nRevenues\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on total return swap, net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on total return swap.\nNet investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net realized gain or loss on total return swap is the net monthly settlement payments received on the TRS. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on total return swap is the net change in the fair value of the TRS.\nWe principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. We may also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity/other securities we hold.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees and other expenses under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other indebtedness, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees compensate the Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments.\nThe Advisor oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. The Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.\nPursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, we reimburse the Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including the Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments and KKR Credit providing administrative services to us on behalf of the Advisor. We reimburse the Advisor no less than monthly for expenses necessary to perform services related to our\nadministration and operations. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of\u2009 (1) the Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that we estimate we would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. Due to our relatively small asset base, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the amount of the allocated expenses to be reimbursed was subject to a monthly minimum of\u2009 $20 to reflect the fact that there was a minimum amount of administrative service performed on our behalf by investment adviser personnel. The Advisor allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. Our board of directors reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among us and certain affiliates of the Advisor. Our board of directors then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of directors considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of directors compares the total amount paid to the Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs.\nWe bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\n\u2022\ncorporate and organization expenses relating to offerings of our securities, subject to limitations included in the investment advisory and administrative services agreement;\n\u2022\nthe cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party pricing or valuation services;\n\u2022\nthe cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;\n\u2022\ninvestment advisory fees;\n\u2022\nfees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;\n\u2022\ninterest payments on our debt or related obligations;\n\u2022\ntransfer agent and custodial fees;\n\u2022\nresearch and market data (including news and quotation equipment and services, and any computer hardware and connectivity hardware (e.g., telephone and fiber optic lines) incorporated into the cost of obtaining such research and market data);\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nfederal and state registration fees;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022\nfees and expenses of directors not also serving in an executive officer capacity for us or the Advisor;\n\u2022\ncosts of proxy statements, stockholders' reports, notices and other filings;\n\u2022\nfidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n\u2022\ndirect costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with accounting, corporate governance, government and regulatory affairs activities, independent audits and outside legal costs;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\nbrokerage commissions for our investments; and\n\u2022\nall other expenses incurred by the Advisor or us in connection with administering our business, including expenses incurred by the Advisor in performing administrative services for us and administrative personnel paid by the Advisor, to the extent they are not controlling persons of the Advisor or any of its affiliates, subject to the limitations included in the investment advisory and administrative services agreement.\nIn addition, we have contracted with State Street Bank and Trust Company to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by the Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance.\nBase Management Fee Deferral Arrangement\nOn November 14, 2018, the Advisor announced that for any calendar quarter ending on or prior to September 30, 2019, it will defer the receipt of base management fees under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement if, and to the extent that, our distributions paid to our stockholders in the calendar quarter exceeds the sum of our investment company taxable income (as defined in Section 852 of the Code), net capital gains (as defined in Section 1222 of the Code) and dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts were not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) in the calendar quarter, or collectively, our distributable funds on a tax basis. The Advisor will only receive any deferred fees in a future calendar quarter if, and to the extent that, our distributable funds on a tax basis in the future calendar quarter exceeds our distributions paid to our stockholders in such quarter. Any payment of deferred base management fees may reduce the amount that we could otherwise distribute in the future. There can be no assurance that the Advisor will continue this program following September 30, 2019.\nPortfolio Investment Activity for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nTotal Portfolio

Our yield may be higher than an investor's yield on an investment in shares of our common stock because it does not reflect sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the purchase or sale of such shares, or operating expenses that may be incurred by us. Our yield does not represent an actual investment return to stockholders, is subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates set forth herein. The weighted average annual yield for accruing debt investments is computed as (i) the sum of (a) the stated annual interest rate of each debt and debt-like investment, multiplied by its par amount, adjusted to U.S. dollars and for any partial income accrual when necessary, as of the end of the applicable reporting period, plus (b) the annual amortization of the purchase or original issue discount or premium of each accreting debt investment; divided by (ii) the total amortized cost of debt investments included in the calculated group as of the end of the applicable reporting period.\nBased on our regular monthly gross cash distribution amount of\u2009 $0.067258 per share as of December 31, 2018 and our distribution reinvestment price of\u2009 $10.75 as of such date, the gross annualized distribution rate was 7.51% as of December 31, 2018. The gross annualized distribution rate includes annual distribution\nfees, as determined in accordance with applicable FINRA rules. The net annualized distribution rate to stockholders, which excludes annual distribution fees, was 6.60% as of December 31, 2018 based on our distribution reinvestment price of\u2009 $10.75. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our total return was 0.60% and our total return without assuming reinvestment of distributions was 0.81%.\nBased on our regular weekly gross cash distribution amount of\u2009 $0.015521 per share as of December 31, 2017, our final offering price of\u2009 $11.65 per share and our distribution reinvestment price of $11.15 as of such date, the gross annualized distribution rate was 6.93% and 7.24%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. The gross annualized distribution rate includes annual distribution fees, as determined in accordance with applicable FINRA rules. The net annualized distribution rate to stockholders, which excludes annual distribution fees, was 6.27% as of December 31, 2017 based on our distribution reinvestment price of\u2009 $11.15. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our total return was 8.34% and our total return without assuming reinvestment of distributions was 8.21%.\nOur estimated gross portfolio yield may be higher than a stockholder's yield on an investment in shares of our common stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us. In addition, our estimated gross portfolio yield and total return figures disclosed above do not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may have been incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield, total return and annualized distribution rate to stockholders do not represent actual investment returns to stockholders, are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates set forth above.

The Advisor uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 4. The Advisor formerly used an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. For the investment ratings as of December 31, 2017, the Advisor has reclassified investments as follows: investments that were ranked a 1 or 2 are now ranked a 1, investments that were ranked a 3 are now ranked a 2, investments that were ranked a 4 are now ranked a 3 and investments that were ranked a 5 are now ranked a 4.

During the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016, we accrued $666 for expense reimbursements that FS Investments agreed to pay. These reimbursements were funded, in part, through the offset of management fees payable by us to FSIC IV Advisor. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we accrued $666 for expense recoupments payable to FS Investments. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any expense recoupments due to FS Investments and no further amounts remain subject to repayment by us to FS Investments in the future.\nSee Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the terminated expense reimbursement agreement and the Advisor's base management fee deferral

31, 2018, the net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments and TRS was primarily driven by the general performance of the underlying debt positions.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $2,678 ($0.08 per share), $20,140 ($0.83 per share) and $8,117 ($1.19 per share), respectively.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $16,765 in cash and foreign currency, which we or our wholly owned financing subsidiaries held in custodial accounts, and $67,529 in cash held as collateral by Citibank under the terms of the TRS. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had $3,935 in capacity available under the TRS and $15,000 in borrowings available under our other financing arrangement, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of December 31, 2018, we also had broadly syndicated investments and opportunistic investments that could be sold to create additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2018, we had seven debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of\u2009 $2,769. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nWe currently generate cash primarily from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments, as well as from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan, and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of the Advisor, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See -Financing Arrangements.\u201d\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the cash received from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments and from the issuance of shares under the distribution reinvestment plan, as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments, primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nFinancing Arrangements\nThe following table presents summary information with respect to our outstanding financing arrangements as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> Arrangement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Type of Arrangement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\nOutstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\nAvailable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Maturity Date\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BNP Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Prime Brokerage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> L+1.25%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> September 27, 2019(1)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Citibank Total Return Swap\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Return Swap\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> L+1.60%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171,065 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> N/A(2)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nAs described in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, this facility generally is terminable upon 270 days' notice by either party. As of December 31, 2018, neither party to the facility had provided notice of its intent to terminate the facility.\n(2)\nThe TRS may be terminated by Cheltenham Funding at any time, subject to an early termination fee if prior to the date 30 days before the Citibank Optional Termination Date, or by Citibank on or after the Citibank Optional Termination Date, in each case, in whole or in part, upon prior written notice to the other party.\nFor additional information regarding our financing arrangements, see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRIC Status and Distributions\nWe have elected to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, make distributions of an amount at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, each tax year. As long as the distributions are declared by the later of the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of a tax year or the due date of the tax return for such tax year, including extensions, distributions paid up to twelve months after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for determining the distributions paid in such tax year. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to qualify for and maintain our RIC tax status each tax year. We are also subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise taxes on certain undistributed income unless we make distributions in a timely manner to our stockholders generally of an amount at least equal to the sum of\u2009 (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains in excess of capital losses, or capital gain net income\u201d (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our stockholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit us to pay any cash distributions. If we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the 1940 Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings.\nOur first distribution was declared for stockholders of record as of January 12, 2016. Prior to the closing of our continuous public offering in November 2017, we declared regular cash distributions on a quarterly basis and paid such distributions on a monthly basis to stockholders of record, as determined on a weekly basis. Effective November 29, 2017, and subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of directors, we declare regular cash distributions on a quarterly basis and pay such distributions on a monthly basis to stockholders of record, as determined on a monthly basis. We will calculate each stockholder's specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates and each stockholder's distributions will begin to accrue on the date we accept such stockholder's subscription for shares of our common stock. From time to time, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or shares of our common stock at the discretion of our board of directors. The timing and amount of any future distributions to stockholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of directors.\nDuring certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a stockholder's investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our stockholders. If FS Investments had not reimbursed certain of our expenses, 15% of the aggregate amount of distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 would have been funded from offering proceeds or borrowings.\nWe intend to continue to make our regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets legally available for distribution, except for those stockholders who elect to receive their distributions in the form of shares of our common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. stockholder.\nThe following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we have declared on our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Distribution(1)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Per Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.64010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2017(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.73902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.70190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nDistribution amounts and per share amounts shown are net of annual distribution fees, which began accruing on February 1, 2017, and reflect the special cash distributions described in footnote (2) below. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion regarding annual distribution fees.\n(2)\nOn a monthly basis from February 2017 through June 2017, we paid special cash distributions in the weekly amount of approximately $0.002 per share, to stockholders of record as of the weekly record dates previously determined by our board of directors for that period. We paid a total of approximately $884 in special cash distributions to stockholders. Our board of directors ratified and approved such monthly special cash distribution payments on August 10, 2017.\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our distributions, including a reconciliation of our GAAP-basis net investment income to our tax-basis net investment income and the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nWe determine the fair value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. In connection with that determination, the Advisor provides our board of directors with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party valuation services.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs\nsuch as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n\u2022\nour quarterly fair valuation process begins with the Advisor reviewing and documenting valuations of each portfolio company or investment, which valuations are obtained from an independent third-party valuation service and provide a valuation range;\n\u2022\nthe Advisor then provides the valuation committee of our board of directors, or the valuation committee, with its valuation recommendation for each portfolio company or investment, along with supporting materials;\n\u2022\npreliminary valuations are then discussed with the valuation committee;\n\u2022\nour valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations and the Advisor, together with our independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, supplement the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the valuation committee;\n\u2022\nfollowing its review, the valuation committee will recommend that our board of directors approve our fair valuations; and\n\u2022\nour board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each such investment in our portfolio in good faith based on various statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of the Advisor, the valuation committee and any independent third-party valuation services, if applicable.\nDetermination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, our board of directors may use any approved independent third-party pricing or valuation services. However, our board of directors is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information obtained from the Advisor or any approved independent third-party valuation or pricing service that our board of directors deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that the Advisor, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of directors may consider when determining the fair value of our investments.\nValuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, we may incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the borrower in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing our debt investments.\nFor convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used.\nOur equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Our board of directors, in its determination of fair value, may consider various factors, such as multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. All of these factors may be subject to adjustments based upon the particular circumstances of a portfolio company or our actual investment position. For example, adjustments to EBITDA may take into account compensation to previous owners or acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring or other related items.\nThe Advisor, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of directors may also consider private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies or industry practices in determining fair value. The Advisor, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of directors may also consider the size and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, and may apply discounts or premiums, where and as appropriate, due to the higher (or lower) financial risk and/or the smaller size of portfolio companies relative to comparable firms, as well as such other factors as our board of directors, in consultation with the Advisor and any approved independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, may consider relevant in assessing fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security.\nWhen we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. Our board of directors subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities received at their fair value.\nThe fair values of our investments are determined in good faith by our board of directors. Our board of directors is responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. Our board of directors has delegated day-to-day responsibility for implementing our valuation policy to the Advisor, and has authorized the Advisor to utilize independent third-party valuation and pricing services that have been approved by our board of directors. The valuation committee is responsible for overseeing the Advisor's implementation of the valuation process.\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nRevenue Recognition\nSecurity transactions are accounted for on the trade date. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. We record dividend income on the ex-dividend date. Distributions received from a limited liability company ( LLC\u201d) and limited partnership ( LP\u201d) investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. We do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such income. Our policy is to place investments on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that interest income will be collected. We consider many factors relevant to an investment when placing it on or removing it from non-accrual status including, but not limited to, the delinquency status of the investment, economic and business conditions, the overall financial condition of the underlying investment, the value of the underlying collateral, bankruptcy status, if any, and any other facts or circumstances relevant to the investment. If there is reasonable doubt that we will receive any previously accrued interest, then the interest income will be written-off. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the collectability of the remaining principal and interest. Non-accrual investments may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are likely to remain current based on our judgment.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and we amortize such amounts as interest income over the respective term of the loan or security. Upon the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees and original issue discount are recorded as interest income. Structuring and other non-recurring upfront fees are recorded as fee income when earned. We record prepayment premiums on loans and securities as fee income when we earn such amounts.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the cumulative effect method applied to in-scope contracts with customers that have not been completed as of the date of adoption. We did not identify any in-scope contracts that had not been completed as of the date of adoption and, as a result, we did not recognize a cumulative effect on stockholders' equity in connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance.\nThe new revenue recognition guidance applies to all entities and all contracts with customers to provide goods or services in the ordinary course of business, excluding, among other things, financial instruments as well as certain other contractual rights and obligations. Under the new revenue recognition guidance, which we have applied to all new in-scope contracts as of the date of adoption, structuring and other upfront fees are recognized as revenue based on the transaction price as the performance obligation is fulfilled. The related performance obligation consists of structuring activities and is satisfied over time as such activities are performed. Consideration is variable and is constrained from being included in the transaction price until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved, typically as of the trade date of the related transaction. Payment is typically due on the settlement date of the related transaction.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $538 in structuring fee revenue under the new revenue recognition guidance and included such revenue in the fee income line item on our consolidated statements of operations. Comparative periods are presented in accordance with revenue recognition guidance effective prior to January 1, 2018, under which we recorded structuring and other non-recurring upfront fees as income when earned. We have determined that the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance did not have a material impact on the amount of revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses, Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation and Net Change in Unrealized Gains or Losses on Foreign Currency\nGains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated by using the specific identification method. We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized fees. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized. Net change in unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency reflects the change in the value of receivables or accruals during the reporting period due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nUncertainty in Income Taxes\nWe evaluate our tax positions to determine if the tax positions taken meet the minimum recognition threshold in connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be taken for the purposes of measuring and recognizing tax benefits or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Recognition of a tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax liabilities as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016, we did not incur any interest or penalties.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into an agreement with the Advisor to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement are equal to (a) an annual base management fee based on the average weekly value of our gross assets and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. The Advisor is reimbursed for administrative expenses incurred on our behalf. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of this agreement and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under similar agreements with FSIC IV Advisor during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016.\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations related to the repayment of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 is as follows:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Maturity Date(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1\u2009-\u20093\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3\u2009-\u20095\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BNP Facility(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>September\u200927,\u20092019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nAmounts outstanding will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on the maturity date.\n(2)\nAs of December 31, 2018, $15,000 remained unused under the BNP Facility.

We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Prior to satisfying the minimum offering requirement, we had no operations except for matters relating to our organization. In November 2017, we closed our continuous public offering of common stock to new investors.\nWe are externally managed by the Advisor pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent. On April 9, 2018, GSO/Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC, or GDFM, resigned as our investment sub-adviser and terminated its investment sub-advisory agreement effective April 9, 2018. In connection with GDFM's resignation as our investment sub-adviser, on April 9, 2018, we entered into the investment advisory and administrative services agreement with the Advisor, which replaced an investment advisory and administrative services agreement, or the FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement, with our former investment adviser, FSIC IV Advisor, LLC, or FSIC IV Advisor.\nOur investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We pursue our investment objective by investing primarily in the debt of middle market U.S. companies with a focus on originated transactions sourced through the network of the Advisor and its affiliates. We define direct originations as any investment where the Advisor or its affiliates negotiates the terms of the transaction beyond just the price, which, for example, may include negotiating financial covenants, maturity dates or interest rate terms. These directly originated transactions include participation in other originated transactions where there may be third parties involved, or a bank acting as an intermediary, for a closely held club, or similar transactions.\nOur portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior secured loans and second lien secured loans of private middle-market U.S. companies and, to a lesser extent, subordinated loans of private U.S. companies. Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be comprised of subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may invest. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the OTC market or directly from our target companies as primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase or otherwise acquire interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity, in our target companies, generally in conjunction with one of our debt investments, including through the restructuring of such investments, or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of corporate bonds, structured products, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. The Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to\nless senior portions of the capital structure or otherwise make opportunistic investments, such as where the market price of loans, bonds or other securities reflects a lower value than deemed warranted by the Advisor's fundamental analysis, which may occur due to general dislocations in the markets, a misunderstanding by the market of a particular company or an industry being out of favor with the broader investment community and may include event driven investments, anchor orders and structured products.\nThe senior secured loans, second lien secured loans and senior secured bonds in which we invest generally have stated terms of three to seven years and subordinated debt investments that we make generally have stated terms of up to ten years, but the expected average life of such securities is generally between three and seven years. However, there is no limit on the maturity or duration of any security in our portfolio. Our debt investments may be rated by a NRSRO and, in such case, generally will carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3\u201d by Moody's or lower than BBB-\u201d by S&P). We also invest in non-rated debt securities.\nRevenues\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on total return swap, net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on total return swap.\nNet investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net realized gain or loss on total return swap is the net monthly settlement payments received on the TRS. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on total return swap is the net change in the fair value of the TRS.\nWe principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. We may also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity/other securities we hold.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees and other expenses under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other indebtedness, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees compensate the Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments.\nThe Advisor oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. The Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.\nPursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, we reimburse the Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including the Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments and KKR Credit providing administrative services to us on behalf of the Advisor. We reimburse the Advisor no less than monthly for expenses necessary to perform services related to our\nadministration and operations. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of\u2009 (1) the Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that we estimate we would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. Due to our relatively small asset base, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the amount of the allocated expenses to be reimbursed was subject to a monthly minimum of\u2009 $20 to reflect the fact that there was a minimum amount of administrative service performed on our behalf by investment adviser personnel. The Advisor allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. Our board of directors reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among us and certain affiliates of the Advisor. Our board of directors then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of directors considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of directors compares the total amount paid to the Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs.\nWe bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\n\u2022\ncorporate and organization expenses relating to offerings of our securities, subject to limitations included in the investment advisory and administrative services agreement;\n\u2022\nthe cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party pricing or valuation services;\n\u2022\nthe cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;\n\u2022\ninvestment advisory fees;\n\u2022\nfees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;\n\u2022\ninterest payments on our debt or related obligations;\n\u2022\ntransfer agent and custodial fees;\n\u2022\nresearch and market data (including news and quotation equipment and services, and any computer hardware and connectivity hardware (e.g., telephone and fiber optic lines) incorporated into the cost of obtaining such research and market data);\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nfederal and state registration fees;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022\nfees and expenses of directors not also serving in an executive officer capacity for us or the Advisor;\n\u2022\ncosts of proxy statements, stockholders' reports, notices and other filings;\n\u2022\nfidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n\u2022\ndirect costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with accounting, corporate governance, government and regulatory affairs activities, independent audits and outside legal costs;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\nbrokerage commissions for our investments; and\n\u2022\nall other expenses incurred by the Advisor or us in connection with administering our business, including expenses incurred by the Advisor in performing administrative services for us and administrative personnel paid by the Advisor, to the extent they are not controlling persons of the Advisor or any of its affiliates, subject to the limitations included in the investment advisory and administrative services agreement.\nIn addition, we have contracted with State Street Bank and Trust Company to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by the Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance.\nBase Management Fee Deferral Arrangement\nOn November 14, 2018, the Advisor announced that for any calendar quarter ending on or prior to September 30, 2019, it will defer the receipt of base management fees under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement if, and to the extent that, our distributions paid to our stockholders in the calendar quarter exceeds the sum of our investment company taxable income (as defined in Section 852 of the Code), net capital gains (as defined in Section 1222 of the Code) and dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts were not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) in the calendar quarter, or collectively, our distributable funds on a tax basis. The Advisor will only receive any deferred fees in a future calendar quarter if, and to the extent that, our distributable funds on a tax basis in the future calendar quarter exceeds our distributions paid to our stockholders in such quarter. Any payment of deferred base management fees may reduce the amount that we could otherwise distribute in the future. There can be no assurance that the Advisor will continue this program following September 30, 2019.\nPortfolio Investment Activity for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nTotal Portfolio Activity\nThe following tables present certain selected information regarding our portfolio investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio at cost and fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio at cost and fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 to include, on a look-through basis, the investments underlying the TRS, as disclosed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. The investments underlying the TRS had a notional amount and market value of\u2009 $171,065 and $164,955, respectively, as of December 31, 2018 and $151,866 and $151,348, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.\n\n(1)\nAmortized cost represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums and/or accretion of discounts, as applicable, on investments.\nThe following table presents certain selected information regarding the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n(1)\nDoes not include investments on non-accrual status.\n(2)\nRepresents the expected yield based on the composition of the portfolio as of the applicable date. Our yield may be higher than an investor's yield on an investment in shares of our common stock because it does not reflect sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the purchase or sale of such shares, or operating expenses that may be incurred by us. Our yield does not represent an actual investment return to stockholders, is subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates set forth herein. The weighted average annual yield for accruing debt investments is computed as (i) the sum of (a) the stated annual interest rate of each debt and debt-like investment, multiplied by its par amount, adjusted to U.S. dollars and for any partial income accrual when necessary, as of the end of the applicable reporting period, plus (b) the annual amortization of the purchase or original issue discount or premium of each accreting debt investment; divided by (ii) the total amortized cost of debt investments included in the calculated group as of the end of the applicable reporting period.\nBased on our regular monthly gross cash distribution amount of\u2009 $0.067258 per share as of December 31, 2018 and our distribution reinvestment price of\u2009 $10.75 as of such date, the gross annualized distribution rate was 7.51% as of December 31, 2018. The gross annualized distribution rate includes annual distribution\nfees, as determined in accordance with applicable FINRA rules. The net annualized distribution rate to stockholders, which excludes annual distribution fees, was 6.60% as of December 31, 2018 based on our distribution reinvestment price of\u2009 $10.75. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our total return was 0.60% and our total return without assuming reinvestment of distributions was 0.81%.\nBased on our regular weekly gross cash distribution amount of\u2009 $0.015521 per share as of December 31, 2017, our final offering price of\u2009 $11.65 per share and our distribution reinvestment price of $11.15 as of such date, the gross annualized distribution rate was 6.93% and 7.24%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. The gross annualized distribution rate includes annual distribution fees, as determined in accordance with applicable FINRA rules. The net annualized distribution rate to stockholders, which excludes annual distribution fees, was 6.27% as of December 31, 2017 based on our distribution reinvestment price of\u2009 $11.15. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our total return was 8.34% and our total return without assuming reinvestment of distributions was 8.21%.\nOur estimated gross portfolio yield may be higher than a stockholder's yield on an investment in shares of our common stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us. In addition, our estimated gross portfolio yield and total return figures disclosed above do not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may have been incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield, total return and annualized distribution rate to stockholders do not represent actual investment returns to stockholders, are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates set forth above. See the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. See footnote 6 to the financial highlights table included in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for information regarding the calculations of our total return.\nDirect Originations\nThe following table presents certain selected information regarding our direct originations as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n(1)\nThe weighted average annual yield for accruing debt investments is computed as (i) the sum of\u2009 (a) the stated annual interest rate of each debt and debt-like investment, multiplied by its par amount, adjusted to U.S. dollars and for any partial income accrual when necessary, as of the end of the applicable reporting period, plus (b) the annual amortization of the purchase or original issue discount or premium of each accreting debt investment; divided by (ii) the total amortized cost of debt investments included in the calculated group as of the end of the applicable reporting period.\nPortfolio Composition by Industry Classification\nSee Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding the composition of our investment portfolio by industry classification.\nPortfolio Asset Quality\nIn addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, the Advisor uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. The Advisor uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 4. The Advisor formerly used an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. For the investment ratings as of December 31, 2017, the Advisor has reclassified investments as follows: investments that were ranked a 1 or 2 are now ranked a 1, investments that were ranked a 3 are now ranked a 2, investments that were ranked a 4 are now ranked a 3 and investments that were ranked a 5 are now ranked a 4. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:\n Investment Rating Summary Description Performing Investment-generally executing in accordance with plan and there are no concerns about the portfolio company's performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. Performing Investment-no concern about repayment of both interest and our cost basis but company's recent performance or trends in the industry require closer monitoring. Underperforming Investment-some loss of interest or dividend possible, but still expecting a positive return on investment. Underperforming Investment-concerns about the recoverability of principal or interest. \nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 4 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nThe amount of the portfolio in each grading category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of the portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the grade of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the Period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016\nRevenues\nOur investment income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016 was as follows:\n\n(1)\nSuch revenues represent $26,279, $19,747 and $3,015 of cash income earned as well as $1,775, $323 and $170 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.\nThe level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. Fee income is transaction based, and typically consists of prepayment fees and structuring fees. As such, fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees.\nExpenses\nOur operating expenses, together with excise taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016 were as follows:\n\nThe following table reflects selected expense ratios as a percent of average net assets for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016:\n\n(1)\nRatio may be rounded in order to recompute the ending ratio of net operating expenses, excluding certain expenses, to average net assets.\nIncentive fees and interest expense, among other things, may increase or decrease our expense ratios relative to comparative periods depending on portfolio performance and changes in amounts outstanding under our financing arrangements and benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR, among other factors.\nExpense Reimbursement\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not accrue any amounts for expense reimbursements. During the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016, we accrued $666 for expense reimbursements that FS Investments agreed to pay. These reimbursements were funded, in part, through the offset of management fees payable by us to FSIC IV Advisor. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we accrued $666 for expense recoupments payable to FS Investments. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any expense recoupments due to FS Investments and no further amounts remain subject to repayment by us to FS Investments in the future.\nSee Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the terminated expense reimbursement agreement and the Advisor's base management fee deferral arrangement.\nNet Investment Income (Loss)\nOur net investment income (loss) totaled $15,135 ($0.48 per share), $6,149 ($0.25 per share) and $(1,765) ($(0.26) per share) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016, respectively.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\nOur net realized gains (losses) on investments, total return swap and foreign currency for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016 were as follows:\n\n(1)\nWe sold investments and received principal repayments of\u2009 $44,669 and $44,519, respectively, during the the year ended December 31, 2018, $42,005 and $30,667, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 and $95,579 and $3,839, respectively, during the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nOur net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and the total return swap for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016 were as follows:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments and TRS was primarily driven by the general performance of the underlying debt positions.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $2,678 ($0.08 per share), $20,140 ($0.83 per share) and $8,117 ($1.19 per share), respectively.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $16,765 in cash and foreign currency, which we or our wholly owned financing subsidiaries held in custodial accounts, and $67,529 in cash held as collateral by Citibank under the terms of the TRS. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had $3,935 in capacity available under the TRS and $15,000 in borrowings available under our other financing arrangement, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of December 31, 2018, we also had broadly syndicated investments and opportunistic investments that could be sold to create additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2018, we had seven debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of\u2009 $2,769. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nWe currently generate cash primarily from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments, as well as from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan, and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of the Advisor, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See -Financing Arrangements.\u201d\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the cash received from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments and from the issuance of shares under the distribution reinvestment plan, as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments, primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nFinancing Arrangements\nThe following table presents summary information with respect to our outstanding financing arrangements as of December 31, 2018:\n\n(1)\nAs described in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Except as required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Stockholders are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to stockholders or through reports that we may file in the future with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The forward-looking statements and projections contained in this annual report on Form 10-K are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on February 25, 2015 and formally commenced investment operations on January 6, 2016 upon raising the minimum offering requirement from sales of shares of our Class T common stock in our continuous public offering to persons who were not affiliated with us or our former Advisor, FSIC IV Advisor, LLC, or FSIC IV Advisor. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Prior to satisfying the minimum offering requirement, we had no operations except for matters relating to our organization. In November 2017, we closed our continuous public offering of common stock to new investors.\nWe are externally managed by the Advisor pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent. On April 9, 2018, GSO/Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC, or GDFM, resigned as our investment sub-adviser and terminated its investment sub-advisory agreement effective April 9, 2018. In connection with GDFM's resignation as our investment sub-adviser, on April 9, 2018, we entered into the investment advisory and administrative services agreement with the Advisor, which replaced an investment advisory and administrative services agreement, or the FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement, with our former investment adviser, FSIC IV Advisor, LLC, or FSIC IV Advisor.\nOur investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We pursue our investment objective by investing primarily in the debt of middle market U.S. companies with a focus on originated transactions sourced through the network of the Advisor and its affiliates. We define direct originations as any investment where the Advisor or its affiliates negotiates the terms of the transaction beyond just the price, which, for example, may include negotiating financial covenants, maturity dates or interest rate terms. These directly originated transactions include participation in other originated transactions where there may be third parties involved, or a bank acting as an intermediary, for a closely held club, or similar transactions.\nOur portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior secured loans and second lien secured loans of private middle-market U.S. companies and, to a lesser extent, subordinated loans of private U.S. companies. Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be comprised of subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may invest. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the OTC market or directly from our target companies as primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase or otherwise acquire interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity, in our target companies, generally in conjunction with one of our debt investments, including through the restructuring of such investments, or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of corporate bonds, structured products, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. The Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to\nless senior portions of the capital structure or otherwise make opportunistic investments, such as where the market price of loans, bonds or other securities reflects a lower value than deemed warranted by the Advisor's fundamental analysis, which may occur due to general dislocations in the markets, a misunderstanding by the market of a particular company or an industry being out of favor with the broader investment community and may include event driven investments, anchor orders and structured products.\nThe senior secured loans, second lien secured loans and senior secured bonds in which we invest generally have stated terms of three to seven years and subordinated debt investments that we make generally have stated terms of up to ten years, but the expected average life of such securities is generally between three and seven years. However, there is no limit on the maturity or duration of any security in our portfolio. Our debt investments may be rated by a NRSRO and, in such case, generally will carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3\u201d by Moody's or lower than BBB-\u201d by S&P). We also invest in non-rated debt securities.\nRevenues\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on total return swap, net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on total return swap.\nNet investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net realized gain or loss on total return swap is the net monthly settlement payments received on the TRS. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on total return swap is the net change in the fair value of the TRS.\nWe principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. We may also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity/other securities we hold.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees and other expenses under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other indebtedness, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees compensate the Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments.\nThe Advisor oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. The Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.\nPursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, we reimburse the Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including the Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments and KKR Credit providing administrative services to us on behalf of the Advisor. We reimburse the Advisor no less than monthly for expenses necessary to perform services related to our\nadministration and operations. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of\u2009 (1) the Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that we estimate we would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. Due to our relatively small asset base, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the amount of the allocated expenses to be reimbursed was subject to a monthly minimum of\u2009 $20 to reflect the fact that there was a minimum amount of administrative service performed on our behalf by investment adviser personnel. The Advisor allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. Our board of directors reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among us and certain affiliates of the Advisor. Our board of directors then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of directors considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of directors compares the total amount paid to the Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs.\nWe bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\n\u2022\ncorporate and organization expenses relating to offerings of our securities, subject to limitations included in the investment advisory and administrative services agreement;\n\u2022\nthe cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party pricing or valuation services;\n\u2022\nthe cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;\n\u2022\ninvestment advisory fees;\n\u2022\nfees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;\n\u2022\ninterest payments on our debt or related obligations;\n\u2022\ntransfer agent and custodial fees;\n\u2022\nresearch and market data (including news and quotation equipment and services, and any computer hardware and connectivity hardware (e.g., telephone and fiber optic lines) incorporated into the cost of obtaining such research and market data);\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nfederal and state registration fees;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022\nfees and expenses of directors not also serving in an executive officer capacity for us or the Advisor;\n\u2022\ncosts of proxy statements, stockholders' reports, notices and other filings;\n\u2022\nfidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n\u2022\ndirect costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with accounting, corporate governance, government and regulatory affairs activities, independent audits and outside legal costs;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\nbrokerage commissions for our investments; and\n\u2022\nall other expenses incurred by the Advisor or us in connection with administering our business, including expenses incurred by the Advisor in performing administrative services for us and administrative personnel paid by the Advisor, to the extent they are not controlling persons of the Advisor or any of its affiliates, subject to the limitations included in the investment advisory and administrative services agreement.\nIn addition, we have contracted with State Street Bank and Trust Company to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by the Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance.\nBase Management Fee Deferral Arrangement\nOn November 14, 2018, the Advisor announced that for any calendar quarter ending on or prior to September 30, 2019, it will defer the receipt of base management fees under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement if, and to the extent that, our distributions paid to our stockholders in the calendar quarter exceeds the sum of our investment company taxable income (as defined in Section 852 of the Code), net capital gains (as defined in Section 1222 of the Code) and dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts were not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) in the calendar quarter, or collectively, our distributable funds on a tax basis. The Advisor will only receive any deferred fees in a future calendar quarter if, and to the extent that, our distributable funds on a tax basis in the future calendar quarter exceeds our distributions paid to our stockholders in such quarter. Any payment of deferred base management fees may reduce the amount that we could otherwise distribute in the future. There can be no assurance that the Advisor will continue this program following September 30, 2019.\nPortfolio Investment Activity for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nTotal Portfolio

Our yield may be higher than an investor's yield on an investment in shares of our common stock because it does not reflect sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the purchase or sale of such shares, or operating expenses that may be incurred by us. Our yield does not represent an actual investment return to stockholders, is subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates set forth herein. The weighted average annual yield for accruing debt investments is computed as (i) the sum of (a) the stated annual interest rate of each debt and debt-like investment, multiplied by its par amount, adjusted to U.S. dollars and for any partial income accrual when necessary, as of the end of the applicable reporting period, plus (b) the annual amortization of the purchase or original issue discount or premium of each accreting debt investment; divided by (ii) the total amortized cost of debt investments included in the calculated group as of the end of the applicable reporting period.\nBased on our regular monthly gross cash distribution amount of\u2009 $0.067258 per share as of December 31, 2018 and our distribution reinvestment price of\u2009 $10.75 as of such date, the gross annualized distribution rate was 7.51% as of December 31, 2018. The gross annualized distribution rate includes annual distribution\nfees, as determined in accordance with applicable FINRA rules. The net annualized distribution rate to stockholders, which excludes annual distribution fees, was 6.60% as of December 31, 2018 based on our distribution reinvestment price of\u2009 $10.75. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our total return was 0.60% and our total return without assuming reinvestment of distributions was 0.81%.\nBased on our regular weekly gross cash distribution amount of\u2009 $0.015521 per share as of December 31, 2017, our final offering price of\u2009 $11.65 per share and our distribution reinvestment price of $11.15 as of such date, the gross annualized distribution rate was 6.93% and 7.24%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. The gross annualized distribution rate includes annual distribution fees, as determined in accordance with applicable FINRA rules. The net annualized distribution rate to stockholders, which excludes annual distribution fees, was 6.27% as of December 31, 2017 based on our distribution reinvestment price of\u2009 $11.15.

Our estimated gross portfolio yield does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us. In addition, our estimated gross portfolio yield and total return figures disclosed above do not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may have been incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield, total return and annualized distribution rate to stockholders do not represent actual investment returns to stockholders, are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates set forth above.

The Advisor uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 4. The Advisor formerly used an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. For the investment ratings as of December 31, 2017, the Advisor has reclassified investments as follows: investments that were ranked a 1 or 2 are now ranked a 1, investments that were ranked a 3 are now ranked a 2, investments that were ranked a 4 are now ranked a 3 and investments that were ranked a 5 are now ranked a 4. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:\n Investment Rating Summary Description Performing Investment-generally executing in accordance with plan and there are no concerns about the portfolio company's performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. Performing Investment-no concern about repayment of both interest and our cost basis but company's recent performance or trends in the industry require closer monitoring. Underperforming Investment-some loss of interest or dividend possible, but still expecting a positive return on investment. Underperforming Investment-concerns about the recoverability of principal or interest. \nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 4 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Rating\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair\nValue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percentage\nof Portfolio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair\nValue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percentage\nof Portfolio\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162,944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>267,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>288,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>267,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amount of the portfolio in each grading category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of the portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the grade of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the Period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016\nRevenues\nOur investment income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016 was as follows:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Period from January 6, 2016\n(Commencement of Operations)\nthrough December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percentage of\nTotal Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percentage of\nTotal Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percentage of\nTotal Income\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Paid-in-kind interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment income(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nSuch revenues represent $26,279, $19,747 and $3,015 of cash income earned as well as $1,775, $323 and $170 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.\nThe level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. Fee income is transaction based, and typically consists of prepayment fees and structuring fees. As such, fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees.\nExpenses\nOur operating expenses, together with excise taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nTable 18:

During the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016, we accrued $666 for expense reimbursements that FS Investments agreed to pay. These reimbursements were funded, in part, through the offset of management fees payable by us to FSIC IV Advisor. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we accrued $666 for expense recoupments payable to FS Investments. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any expense recoupments due to FS Investments and no further amounts remain subject to repayment by us to FS Investments in the future.\nSee Note 4 to our

Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2016, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $2,678 ($0.08 per share), $20,140 ($0.83 per share) and $8,117 ($1.19 per share), respectively.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $16,765 in cash and foreign currency, which we or our wholly owned financing subsidiaries held in custodial accounts, and $67,529 in cash held as collateral by Citibank under the terms of the TRS. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had $3,935 in capacity available under the TRS and $15,000 in borrowings available under our other financing arrangement, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of December 31, 2018, we also had broadly syndicated investments and opportunistic investments that could be sold to create additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2018, we had seven debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of\u2009 $2,769. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nWe currently generate cash primarily from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments, as well as from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan, and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of the Advisor, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See -Financing Arrangements.\u201d\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the cash received from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments and from the issuance of shares under the distribution reinvestment plan, as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments, primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nFinancing Arrangements\nThe following table presents summary information with respect to our outstanding financing arrangements as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> Arrangement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Type of Arrangement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\nOutstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\nAvailable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Maturity Date\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BNP Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Prime Brokerage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> L+1.25%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> September 27, 2019(1)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Citibank Total Return Swap\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Return Swap\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> L+1.60%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171,065 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> N/A(2)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nAs described in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report"}
