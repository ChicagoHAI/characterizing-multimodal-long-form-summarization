Readers should carefully review the risk factors disclosed in this Form 10-K and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC.\nAs used in this report, the terms Company\u201d, we\u201d, our\u201d, us\u201d and NNVC\u201d refer to Nanoviricides, Inc., a Nevada corporation.\nPRELIMINARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which we indicate by words or phrases such as anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d will,\u201d we believe,\u201d NNVC believes,\u201d management believes\u201d and similar language. The forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of NNVC and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those set forth in the discussion under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this report. Actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. We base the forward-looking statements on information currently available to us, and we assume no obligation to update them.\nInvestors are also advised to refer to the information in our previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), especially on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, in which we discuss in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. As such, investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks and uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions.\nManagement's Plan of Operation\nThe Company's drug development business model was formed in May 2005 with a license to the patents and intellectual property held by TheraCour Pharma, Inc., that enabled creation of drugs engineered specifically to combat viral diseases in humans. This exclusive license from TheraCour Pharma serves as a foundation for our intellectual property. The Company was granted a worldwide exclusive perpetual license to this technology for several drugs with specific targeting mechanisms in perpetuity for the treatment of the following human viral diseases: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Rabies, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Influenza and Asian Bird Flu Virus. The Company has entered into an Additional License Agreement with TheraCour granting the Company the exclusive licenses in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the additional virus types for Dengue viruses, Japanese Encephalitis virus, West Nile Virus, Viruses causing viral Conjunctivitis (a disease of the eye) and Ocular Herpes, and Ebola/Marburg viruses. The Company may want to add further virus types to its drug pipeline. The Company would then need to negotiate with TheraCour an amendment to the Licensing Agreement to include those of such additional viruses that the Company determines it wants to follow for further development. We are seeking to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery pre-clinical development programs and through an in-licensing strategy.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company plans to develop several drugs through the preclinical studies and clinical trial phases with the goal of eventually obtaining approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) and International regulatory agencies for these drugs. The Company plans, when appropriate, to seek regulatory approvals in several international markets, including developed markets such as Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Emerging Regions such as Southeast Asia, India, China, Central and South America, as well as the African subcontinent. The seeking of these regulatory approvals would only come when and if one or more of our drugs, now in early stage of pre-clinical development, has significantly advanced through the US FDA and international regulatory process. If and as these advances occur, the Company may attempt to partner with more established pharmaceutical companies to advance the various drugs through the approval process.\nThe Company intends to perform the regulatory filings and own all the regulatory licenses for the drugs it is currently developing. The Company will develop these drugs in part via subcontracts to TheraCour Pharma, Inc., the exclusive source for these nanomaterials. The Company may manufacture these drugs itself, or under subcontract arrangements with external manufacturers that carry the appropriate regulatory licenses and have appropriate capabilities. The Company intends to distribute these drugs via subcontracts with distributor companies or in partnership arrangements. The Company plans to market these drugs either on its own or in conjunction with marketing partners. The Company also plans to actively pursue co-development, as well as other licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies. Such agreements may entail up-front payments, milestone payments, royalties, and/or cost sharing, profit sharing and many other instruments that may bring early revenues to the Company. Such licensing and/or co-development agreements may shape the manufacturing and development options that the Company may pursue. The Company has received significant interest from certain pharmaceutical companies for potential licensing or co-development of some of our drug candidates. However, none of these distributor or co-development agreements is in place at the current time.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to develop effective nanoviricides, or if developed, that we will have sufficient resources to be able to successfully manufacture and market these products to commence revenue-generating operations.\nThere can be no assurance that other developments in the field would not impact our business plan adversely. For example, successful creation and availability of an effective vaccine may reduce the potential market size for a particular viral disease.\nOur goal, which we can give no assurance that we will achieve, is for NanoViricides, Inc. to become the premier company developing highly safe and effective drugs that employ an integrated multiplicity of actions as enabled by our nanomedicine approach for anti-viral therapy.\nTo date, we have engaged in organizational activities; developing and sourcing compounds and preparing nano-materials; and experimentation involving preclinical studies using cell cultures and animals. We have generated funding through the issuances of debt and the sales of securities under our shelf registration and the private placement of common stock (See, Item 5). The Company does not currently have any long term debt, other than Series B Convertible Debentures of $6M and the Series C Convertible Debentures of $5M presented in the Financial Statements and more fully described herein. We have not generated any revenues and we do not expect to generate revenues in the near future. We may not be successful in developing our drugs and start selling our products when planned, or we may not become profitable in the future. We have incurred net losses in each fiscal period since inception of our operations.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Collaborations and Service Contract Agreements\nOur development model is to employ collaborations and service contract relationships with renowned academic labs, government labs, as well as service contracts with external service providers in order to minimize our capital requirements.\nAll of our agreements provide for the evaluation of Nanoviricides\u00ae substances created and provided by the Company to the Laboratory (or Collaborator). In general, the Laboratory is compensated for certain material and personnel costs for these evaluations. The evaluations involve in vitro and in vivo scientific studies at the Laboratory using their established protocols. In some cases, the Company provides scientific input regarding certain modifications to their protocols as may be needed. The Laboratory returns the results and data to the Company. The Laboratory is allowed to publish the results after allowing time for the Company to protect intellectual property (IP) as needed. The Company sends nanoviricides as well as positive control (i.e. known therapeutics) and negative control (i.e. known not to work) compounds as needed in a fully formulated, ready to use form, to the Laboratory. All IP related to the nanoviricide materials, their formulations and reformulations, and their usage, rests with the Company. Any IP developed by the Laboratory regarding their own know-how, such as laboratory tests, their modifications, etc. rests with the Laboratory. Joint inventions are treated as per applicable US Laws.\nThe Company tries to choose the scientific laboratories with the most appropriate facilities and know-how relating to a particular field for the evaluation of an antiviral agent developed by the Company. The Company also tries to work with more than one laboratory for the evaluation of an antiviral agent developed by the Company. The Company also tries to work with more than one laboratory for a given group of viruses whenever possible. We seek to improve confidence by obtaining independent datasets for corroboration of the efficacy and safety of the nanoviricides we develop. In addition, the Company is not dependent on a particular Laboratory for the development of any specific drug candidate in our product pipeline.\nTo date, the Company has engaged in non-GLP Efficacy and Safety evaluations in both in vitro (cell culture models) and in vivo (animal models) of our different Nanoviricides\u00ae at different laboratories.\nOur current relationships include:\nFor Herpes Virus Infections, and for Viral Diseases of the Eye (Adenoviruses, Herpesviruses - Epidemic Kerato-conjunctivitis (EKC), Herpes Keratitis):\nTable 76: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>1. </td> <td>The CORL at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>2. </td> <td>The Campbell Lab at the University of Pittsburgh, PA </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>3. </td> <td>Department of Ophthalmology, Baylor University College of Medicine, Houston, TX </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>4. </td> <td>TransPharm Preclinical Solutions, MI, a CRO </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor Influenza Viruses:\nTable 80: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>1. </td> <td>The Webster Lab at St Jude Children's Hospital, TN </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>2. </td> <td>Integrated Biotherapeutics, Inc., MD. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>3. </td> <td>Public Health England, UK </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>4. </td> <td>Southern Research Institute, AL. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses:\nTable 84: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>1. </td> <td>University of California at Berkeley, Prof. Eva Harris Lab. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor HIV:\nTable 85: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>1. </td> <td>Southern Research Institute, Frederick, MD. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>2. </td> <td>Other collaborations in development. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor Ebola/Marburg Viruses:\nTable 87: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>1. </td> <td>United States Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Dr. Pamela Glass Lab. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>2. </td> <td>Public Health England, UK. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we have signed an agreement with the Biologics Consulting Group (BCG), Alexandria, Virginia, to help us with the US FDA applications processes, and with the development of applications as well as drug development programs, as needed. We have also signed an agreement with Australian Biologics Pty, Ltd. to help us with the regulatory processes in Australia.\nWe have also signed a Master Services Agreement with BASi to perform cGLP and GLP-like safety and toxicological studies that are necessary for filing an IND for each of our drugs.\nIn April 2014, we finalized a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with Public Health England (PHE), UK, the British government's equivalent of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, This agreement allows for animal efficacy evaluation of various nanoviricides drug candidates against viruses of mutual interest at the BSL2, BSL3 or BSL4 facilities at PHE-UK as the case may be.\nWe have also recently signed a Master Services Agreement with Integrated Biotherapeutics, Inc. ( IBT\u201d), Gaithersburg, MD, a provider of pre-clinical anti-viral evaluation services. We intend to perform certain influenza drug candidate studies at IBT.\nWe have additional collaborations in the process of formalization. We have also signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement with the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM.\nWe typically employ more than one external laboratory to perform testing for a particular disease agent in order to limit possible laboratory level bias. We previously had a collaborative research agreement with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Dr. Putnak Lab, for work on dengue viruses. This agreement has since lapsed, but we believe it can be reactivated at an opportune time.\nTo date, we have entered into the following collaborations.\nHSV-1 and HSV-2 Nanoviricides Efficacy Evaluation Agreement with the Collaborative Ophthalmic Research Laboratories (CORL) at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI.\nIn January 2016, we signed an agreement with CORL. Under this agreement, CORL will perform evaluation of efficacy of our nanoviricides drug candidates in cell culture assays as well as in small animal studies towards the goal of filing an IND application for ocular Herpes Keratitis, and possibly for recurrent Herpes Labialis (RHL, cold sores\u201d). The studies will be performed in the laboratory of Dr. Curtis Brandt, an expert in herpes simplex virus infections and in evaluating anti-viral agents.\nEvaluation of Nanoviricides Efficacy Against Ocular Viral Infections; Agreement with the Campbell Lab at the University of Pittsburgh, PA\nIn January 2016, we signed an agreement with the Campbell Lab. Under this Agreement, the Campbell Lab will perform evaluation of efficacy of our nanoviricides drug candidates in cell culture assays against various strains of HSV-1, HSV-2, and Adenoviruses. Successful candidates will be further evaluated for efficacy in industry standard ocular animal models for Herpes Keratitis as well as Adenoviral Epidemic KeratoConjunctivitis (EKC), towards the goal of filing IND application(s) for ocular Herpes Keratitis, and for EKC. The research will be performed in the Charles T. Campbell Ophthalmic Microbiology Laboratory by Dr. Eric Romanowski, Research Director. Dr. Romanowski has extensive experience in ocular virus infections and anti-viral agents discovery.\nAgreement with the Department of Ophthalmology, Baylor University College of Medicine, Houston, TX\nIn February 2016, we signed an agreement with the Pflugfelder Lab at Baylor. Under this Agreement, the Lab will perform confirmatory testing of certain nanoviricides for efficacy in a small animal model of Herpes Keratitis. The research will be supervised by Dr. Stephen Pflugfelder, Professor of Ophthalmology and the James and Margaret Elkins Chair in Ophthalmology at Baylor. Dr. Pflugfelder has extensive experience in ophthalmological research as well as in ocular drug development, including conducting clinical trials. The research will be performed in the laboratories of the Department of Ophthalmology. This program is currently on hold until appropriate personnel are hired at the Lab.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development Agreement with Professor Ken Rosenthal's laboratory at the Northeastern Ohio Medical University (NEOMED, formerly called NEOUCOM)\nOn May 13, 2010, the Company announced that it had signed a research and development agreement with Professor Ken Rosenthal's laboratory at the Northeastern Ohio Medical University (NEOMED). Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Professor Rosenthal and NEOMED will evaluate the effectiveness of nanoviricides drug candidates against Herpes Simplex Viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2, in both cell culture and animal models. The focus of this evaluation will be the development of drug candidates against herpes skin infections (oral and genital herpes). Dr. Ken Rosenthal is a professor of microbiology, immunology and biochemistry at NEOMED. He is a leading researcher in the field of herpes viruses. His laboratory has developed an improved mouse model of skin-infection with HSV to follow the disease progression. This model has been shown to provide highly uniform and reproducible results. A uniform disease pattern including onset of lesions and further progression to zosteriform lesions is observed in all animals in this model. This uniformity makes it an ideal model for comparative testing of various drug candidates which, the Company believes, can be expected to lead to a broad-spectrum anti-HSV antiviral treatment capable of attacking both HSV-1 and HSV-2.\nOn August 16, 2010, the Company reported that its anti-Herpes drug candidates demonstrated significant efficacy in the recently completed cell culture studies in Dr. Rosenthal Lab at NEOMED. Several of the anti-Herpes nanoviricides\u00ae demonstrated a dose-dependent maximal inhibition of Herpes virus infectivity in a cell culture model. Almost complete inhibition of the virus production was observed at clinically usable concentrations. These studies employed the H129 strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). H129 is an encephalitic strain that closely resembles a clinical isolate; it is known to be more virulent than classic HSV-1 laboratory strains. The H129 strain will be used in subsequent animal testing of nanoviricides. Since then the Company was optimizing formulations for use in the dermal HSV-1 H129c infection animal model in the Rosenthal lab. The Company also continued to further optimize the anti-herpes nanoviricides. Our herpes program was run at a lower priority than other programs until recently. In April 2015, after only 4 cycles of SAR (Structure-Activity-Relationship based improvements), our anti-herpes nanoviricides demonstrated strong effectiveness in the lethal HSV-1 H129c dermal infection model in the Rosenthal Lab at NEOMED. Treatment with certain nanoviricides caused significant improvements in the clinical observations, and led to >85% survival of the infected animals, wherein 100% of the untreated animals died within 10 days. In August 2015, the Company reported that these results were reproduced in dermal animal model at Transpharm, with 100% of the nanoviricides treated animals surviving.\nThe HerpeCide program has thus advanced to the lead identification stage now. We are now working on this program with a high priority, in parallel with our Injectable FluCide program.\nProfessor Rosenthal retired in December 2014, continued his laboratory and our R&D through April 2015, and has closed the lab thereafter. He is now Professor at Roseman University of Health Sciences College of Medicine, NV. He continues as Professor Emeritus at Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED).\nPre-Clinical Services Agreement with TransPharm\nIn January 2015, we commenced a master pre-clinical studies agreement with Transpharm Preclinical Solutions ( TransPharm\u201d), a pre-clinical research services organization (CRO) in Jackson, MI. TransPharm has and will perform the topical dermal efficacy studies for our anti-HSV drug candidates. The agreement can also be extended to other indications for which TransPharm may already have an animal model or may be able to establish an animal model.\nRegulatory Consulting and Advisory Agreement with Biologics Consulting Group, VA (BCG).\nIn July 2011 we signed an agreement with Biologics Consulting Group to help us with our regulatory strategy and filings. Several of the members of the BCG faculty had experience working as part of the US FDA.\nBCG has helped us with the pre-IND filing for our anti-Influenza drug candidate, and for developing the herpesvirus treatment strategy.\nIn July 2012 we signed an agreement with Australian Biologics Pty Ltd to help us with our regulatory strategy and filings in Australia, and to help us with potentially developing clinical trials programs in Australia.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTechnical Testing Agreement, dated December 15, 2007, between The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research ( Feinstein\u201d) and NanoViricides, Inc.\nThe term of this agreement ran from December 17, 2007 through December 31, 2010. Feinstein performed animal studies testing services on epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis and related viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. All test results and inventions resulting from the tests remained property of the Company. Inventions resulting from the testing services would be determined by an independent patent counsel with the Company retaining a commercial license on such inventions. The Company paid Feinstein an amount equal to $40,090.19 for the costs associated with the research.\nThe first study of nanoviricide effectiveness against adenoviral EKC was completed at Feinstein in June, 2008. The study indicated that the best nanoviricide drug candidate showed excellent clearance of clinical signs of the disease, viz. redness of the eye as well as sticky exudates, in a short time after treatment.\nAnti-Influenza Drug Development Agreement with the Webster Lab at St Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN\nIn May 2016, we signed an agreement with the Webster Lab at St. Jude Children's Hospital. Under this Agreement, the Webster Lab will evaluate nanoviricide drug candidates in cell culture studies against a large number of Influenza viruses to optimize the efficacy and broad-spectrum for a clinical development candidate. Variations on the previously selected ligand in NV-INF-1 and NV-INF-2 will be performed if necessary.\nThe testing of these candidates for anti-influenza activity will be performed in the laboratory of Dr. Elena Govorkova in collaboration with Dr. Robert G. Webster and will include both in vitro and in vivo studies. They have extensive experience in influenza virus infections with a large number of different influenza strains, and in anti-viral agents discovery. The overall objective of these studies will be to help select clinical drug development candidates for the treatment of influenza virus in humans, using both the injectable and oral administration routes. Injectable administration is preferable for hospitalized patients that are extremely sick, while oral administration is preferred for out-patients.\nThe most optimal candidate will then be evaluated against a wide variety of Influenza viruses in small animal efficacy studies with a goal of obtaining data for an IND submission for Injectable FluCide drug candidate for severely ill hospitalized patients, and also for Oral FluCide drug candidate for out-patients with Influenza.\nSafety/Toxicology Studies Agreement with BASi\nIn September 2014, we signed an agreement with BASi. BASi is a pre-clinical contract services organization that specializes in cGLP and GLP-like safety and toxicological testing of drug candidates and preparation of the Tox Package\u201d section of an IND application. BASi performed a GLP-like preliminary safety and toxicology study in which there were no significant compound related adverse events found. Our safety and toxicology studies for FluCide are being conducted by BASi for submission with an IND application. BASi will also perform the safety toxicology studies for the anti-herpes nanoviricide drug candidates in our HerpeCide program.\nResearch and Development Agreement with the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley)\nOn February 16, 2010, the Company announced that it had signed a research and development agreement with Dr. Eva Harris's laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley). Under this agreement, Dr. Harris and coworkers will evaluate the effectiveness of nanoviricides\u00ae drug candidates against various dengue viruses. Cell culture models as well as in vivo animal studies will be employed for testing the drug candidates. Dr. Eva Harris is a Professor of Infectious Diseases at UC Berkeley. She is a leading researcher in the field of dengue. Her group has developed a unique animal model for dengue virus infection and disease that effectively emulates the pathology seen in humans. In particular, the critical problem of dengue virus infection, called Antibody-Dependent Enhancement\u201d (ADE), is reproduced in this animal model. When a person who was previously infected with one serotype of dengue virus is later infected by a different serotype, the antibodies produced by the immune system can lead to increased severity of the second dengue infection, instead of controlling it. ADE thus can lead to severe dengue disease or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). This agreement was extended in 2014.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaster Services Agreement, dated August 31, 2009, by and between Southern Research Institute ( Southern\u201d) and NanoViricides, Inc.\nThe term of this agreement was three years from its execution. The Company agrees to supply necessary quantities of its products in order for Southern to complete specific studies as to the efficacy and safety of the Company's compounds. The Company shall pay charges associated with each task order and provide payment in the amount and as indicated therein. Under this agreement, Southern will estimate the work load and invoices for additional task orders, subject to the Company's agreement on costs.\nThe Company's anti-HIV drug testing in cell cultures is performed at the Southern Research Institute in Frederick, MD.\nCooperative Research and Development Agreement for Material Transfer, dated October 15, 2007, between NanoViricides, Inc. and United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease ( Laboratory\u201d).\nThe term of the agreement was for one year initially and extended for an additional year. It has been extended again, based on positive results. The Company shall invent, develop, and provide to the laboratory, Nanoviricides\u00ae that are expected to be capable of attacking a multiplicity of different Ebola and Marburg viruses. The Laboratory shall assess in vitro and in vivo activity of the anti-Ebola Nanoviricides\u00ae provided against the virus.\nPreliminary studies began in February 2008. Certain nanoviricides candidates were found to be highly successful against Ebola virus in pre-clinical cell culture studies. Ebola virus is known to produce, in vivo, a soluble decoy protein that is a portion of its surface glycoprotein. If the nanoviricides that were successful in the in vitro studies bind to the decoy protein portion of the Ebola virus envelope, then we would expect that the nanoviricides would be neutralized in vivo by the decoy protein. We are therefore developing novel ligands that would potentially bind to the Ebola virus glycoprotein portion that is known to be not a part of the decoy protein. The MTA was extended for another year in October, 2009 to continue these studies.\nCooperative Research and Development Agreement for Material Transfer, dated October, 2014, between NanoViricides, Inc. and United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease ( Laboratory\u201d).\nThe term of the agreement is for one year. The Company shall invent, develop, and provide to the laboratory, nanoviricides\u00ae that are expected to be capable of attacking a multiplicity of different Ebola and Marburg viruses. The Laboratory shall assess in vitro and in vivo activity of the anti-Ebola Nanoviricides\u00ae provided against the virus.\nThere is no payment by the Company to the Laboratory, nor from the Laboratory to the Company. USAMRIID has federal funding to support their part of the work.\nThe Company has lowered the priority of this program during the recent economic crisis in order to use our resources most effectively.\nClinical Study Agreement, dated May 6, 2009, between NanoViricides, Inc. and TheVac, LLC. ( Laboratory\u201d).\nOn May 6, 2009, the Company entered into a Clinical Study Agreement with THEVAC, LLC, a company affiliated with the Emerging Technology Center of the Louisiana State University. TheVac performed biological testing of certain anti-herpes nanoviricides. TheVac conducted studies on the effect of anti-herpes nanoviricide drug candidates against certain herpes simplex viruses in cell culture models. The studies indicated a >99.9% reduction in HSV-1 in cell culture assays by certain of our nanoviricide drug candidates. The Company paid the Laboratory the amount of $55,000 for the studies.\nMaterials Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between NanoViricides, Inc. and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe CRADA provided that the CDC would test the efficacy of the Company's drug candidates against rabies. The nanoviricides provided by the Company remained its proprietary information. The CDC retains rights to certain inventions that may be conceived during testing. The Company paid the CDC an amount equal to approximately $10,000 for the costs associated with the research.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Agreements and Contracts\nThe Company continues to receive or obtain and evaluate various research and drug development collaborations with a number of parties that include government institutions, academic labs, contract service organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and other potential business collaborators or partners in the normal course of business. We have also received requests for material for testing under Material Testing Agreements (MTAs) from certain agencies. However, there can be no assurance that a final agreement may be forthcoming.\nFurther, the Company has had preliminary negotiations and discussions with other pharma and non-pharma commercial enterprises regarding commercial projects based on the Company's technologies.\nWe have developed lead drug candidates against a number of viral diseases. Proof-of-principle efficacy studies in animals have been conducted successfully in many of these.\nKARD Scientific, LLC, Beverly, MA has performed several of the animal studies for evaluation of efficacy and of preliminary safety of our nanoviricides drug candidates against Influenza and HIV to date. KARD's contract services operations were closed down by its owner, Dr. Krishna Menon, due to personal reasons in 2014.\nPreviously, in December, 2005, the Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi (NIHE), a unit of the Vietnamese Government's Ministry of Health. This Memorandum of Understanding calls for cooperation in the development and testing of certain nanoviricides. The parties agreed that NanoViricides will retain all intellectual property rights with respect to any resulting product and that the initial target would be the development of drugs against H5N1 (avian influenza). NIHE thereafter requested that we develop a drug for rabies, a request to which we agreed. The initial phase of this agreement called first for laboratory testing, followed by animal testing of several drug candidates developed by the Company. Preliminary laboratory testing of our anti-Influenza drug candidates in the FluCide\u2122 program were successfully performed at the laboratories of the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi (NIHE), against both clade 1 and clade 2 of H5N1 virus isolated in Vietnam. Successful animal testing of RabiCide-ITM, the Company's rabies drug, was performed in Vietnam during the first half of 2007, and reproducibly repeated in 2008. Rabies testing can safely be done at their BSL2 facility. The H5N1 animal testing requires a BSL3 (biological safety laboratory level 3) laboratory. NIHE has acquired a BSL3 animal testing capacity during 2008.\nWe have finalized execution of a Materials Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (M-CRADA) with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA in July, 2008. This agreement was initiated based on our success against Rabies in the animal studies conducted at NIHE Vietnam. Preliminary animal studies against Rabies were expected to start in the last quarter of calendar year 2009 or first quarter of calendar year 2010. The Company has lowered the priority of this program during the recent economic crisis in order to use our resources most effectively. Subsequent to the agreement execution, the Company has supplied certain materials to CDC for testing. This testing, if successful, is expected to expand to involve potential use of nanoviricides as (1) a post- infection therapeutic drug against rabies, possibly in conjunction with a rabies vaccine, and (2) a post-exposure prophylactic drug against rabies, to replace costly human or monoclonal antibodies, possibly in conjunction with a rabies vaccine. To date, there is no effective post-infection therapeutic against rabies. Post-exposure prophylaxis market has been estimated to be as much $300M to $500M worldwide.\nWe finalized a CRADA with Walter Reed Army Institutes of Research (WRAIR) to develop collaboratively antiviral agents against all four types of dengue viruses in April, 2007. Preliminary work has commenced under this CRADA. This CRADA will need to be renegotiated due to changes in funding requirements at WRAIR. The Company has not renewed this agreement.\nOn May 17, 2010, the Company announced that it had signed a research and development agreement with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), for the testing of its anti-HIV drug candidates. Most recently, the Company's anti-HIV injectables animal testing was performed by KARD Scientific.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above collaborations, subcontract, or service contract agreements, and our on-going animal studies at KARD scientific were sufficient to perform preliminary evaluations of effectiveness and safety of our drug candidates against a number of diseases.\nIn May 2013, we retained Cot\u00e9 Orphan Consulting (COC), headed by Dr. Tim Cot\u00e9, to help us with identifying orphan drug indications in our portfolio and to perform the regulatory agency submissions needed for obtaining orphan drug designations for those drugs.\nIn April 2014, we finalized a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with Public Health England (PHE), UK the British government's equivalent of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. This agreement allows for animal efficacy evaluation of various nanoviricides drug candidates against viruses of mutual interest at the BSL2, BSL3 or BSL4 facilities at PHE-UK as the case may be. Previously, we had signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement with PHE in July 2013. The MSA allows the scientists at Public Health England to develop a specific proposal for the testing of different nanoviricides, such as FluCide\u2122, against viruses of mutual interest\u201d to both organizations.\nIn May 2014, we executed a Master Services Agreement with Integrated Biotherapeutics, Inc. ( IBT\u201d), Gaithersburg, MD, a provider of pre-clinical anti-viral evaluation services. We intend to perform certain influenza drug candidate studies at IBT.\nSignificant Alliances and Related Parties\nTheraCour Pharma, Inc.\nPursuant to an Exclusive License Agreement we entered into with TheraCour Pharma, Inc., (TheraCour), the Company was granted exclusive licenses in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the virus types: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS), Influenza including Asian Bird Flu Virus, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), and Rabies. The Company has entered into an Additional License Agreement with TheraCour granting the Company the exclusive licenses in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the additional virus types for Dengue viruses, Japanese Encephalitis virus, West Nile Virus, Viruses causing viral Conjunctivitis (a disease of the eye) and Ocular Herpes, and Ebola/Marburg viruses.\nIn consideration for obtaining these exclusive licenses, we agreed: (1) that TheraCour can charge its costs (direct and indirect) plus no more than 30% of certain direct costs as a Development Fee and such development fees shall be due and payable in periodic installments as billed; (2) to pay $25,000 per month for usage of lab supplies and chemicals from existing stock held by TheraCour; (3) we will pay $2,000 or actual costs monthly, whichever is higher, for other general and administrative expenses incurred by TheraCour on our behalf; (4) make royalty payments (calculated as a percentage of net sales of the licensed drugs) of 15% to TheraCour Pharma, Inc.; (5) TheraCour Pharma, Inc. retains the exclusive right to develop and manufacture the licensed drugs. TheraCour Pharma, Inc. will manufacture the licensed drugs exclusively for NanoViricides, and unless such license is terminated, will not manufacture such product for its own sake or for others; and (6) TheraCour may request and NanoViricides, Inc. will pay an advance payment (refundable) equal to twice the amount of the previous months invoice to be applied as a prepayment towards expenses. TheraCour may terminate the license upon a material breach by us as specified in the agreement. However, we may avoid such termination if within 90 days of receipt of such termination notice we cure the breach.\nDevelopment costs charged by TheraCour Pharma, Inc. for the year ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $3,731,498, $2,403,126 and $2,611,754 respectively. At June 30, 2016, open accounts payable of $767,454 is due TheraCour.\nNo royalties are due TheraCour from the Company's inception through June 30, 2016.\nTheraCourPharma, Inc., is affiliated with the Company through the common control of it and our Company by Anil Diwan, President, who is a director of each corporation, and owns approximately 70% of the capital stock of TheraCourPharma, Inc., which itself owns approximately 15.7 % of the Common Stock of the Company.\nTheraCourPharma, Inc. owns 9,619,170 shares of the Company's outstanding Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock at June 30, 2016.\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's Drug Pipeline\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement has significantly reprioritized its drug development programs with a view to bring its first drug candidate into human clinical trials as soon as possible. Table 2 lists the current drug development programs, targeted viruses, specific indications, current development stage, and priority levels.\nThe Company currently has drug candidates for eight different indications in various stages of development towards IND-filings. Of these, we believe that the Skin Cream against VZV and the Skin Cream against Herpes Labialis (or Recurrent Herpes Labialis, RHL) present the most rapid opportunities for maturing into clinical trials. We believe that the FluCide drug candidates will follow later because of the significant development work that needs to be performed in pre-clinical studies against a number of different influenza virus strains and subtypes.\nManagement's beliefs are based on results of pre-clinical cell culture studies and in vivo animal studies using small animals such as various types of specially engineered mice and rabbits, as appropriate.\nThe Company has not yet performed detailed safety profile studies to be included in a Tox Package\u201d for submission to the FDA for any of our drug candidates. Our studies regarding safety of the various nanoviricide drug candidates to date have been preliminary and of a limited nature.\nHerpeCide - We are currently optimizing the anti-HSV ligands in animal studies for different disease indications. We believe we will be able to successfully advance the optimized drug candidates into an IND and human clinical trials. We are developing anti-herpesvirus drugs against four different indications at present, namely, (1) skin cream for topical treatment of shingles (VZV), (2) skin cream for herpes labialis and recurrent herpes labialis (RHL) (HSV-1), (3) Eye drops for Herpes Keratitis treatment, and (4) skin cream for genital herpes (HSV-2) treatment.\nNanoviricide Eye Drops - We previously undertook a new project and have already designed a ligand, made a nanoviricide drug, and completed successful animal studies that indicate significant preliminary efficacy and safety of a drug candidate against the severe pink eye disease caused by adenoviruses called epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis. We have expanded the indication to include HSV, another cause of viral eye diseases. We designed new broad-spectrum ligands expected to be active against all HSV types and strains, as well as retaining the previously observed activity features against adenoviruses and created new nanoviricide drug candidates. We have already tested these against HSV in cell cultures. Animal model studies against Herpes Keratitis are anticipated after we improve the anti-HSV activity of the drug candidates.\nFluCide. Injectable and Oral forms of the broad-spectrum anti-influenza drug candidate are currently in preclinical studies against all common influenzas as well as avian influenza H5N1. It is based on ligands that we have developed through rational drug design. These ligands are based on a well-known mechanism by which influenza viruses bind to cells. One mechanism involves the hemagglutinin coat protein of influenza virus binding to sialic acids on cell surfaces. Our broad-spectrum ligand used in FluCide is based on the sialic acid expressed by cells. Therefore, it is expected to work well against all of the influenza viruses. Since all influenza viruses, no matter what type (A, B, C), which subtype (e.g. HxNy of Influenza A), or clades, or strains, must bind to one of two varieties of sialic acid, we have designed the ligand such that all of the influenza viruses may bind to our ligand. If an influenza virus escapes FluCide, this mutant virus would be unable to bind to both types of sialic acids, and would be thus unable to infect most animal species, including birds and mammals. We are currently developing an Injectable FluCide drug for hospitalized patients, and an Oral FluCide drug for the rest of the patients.\nDengueCide - We obtained an orphan drug designation from the US FDA for our lead drug candidate in this program. We now plan on engaging into full pre-clinical development program for this drug candidate.\nHIVCide is our first announced drug project against HIV-I. Our first HIV drug to be developed is a targeted nanoviricide against HIV and is engineered with specific recognition ligands that allow multiple-point binding to inactivate HIV virus in the bloodstream.\nThe Company thus has a strong and growing drug pipeline to take us several years into the future. The Company already has technologies in development that promise to yield even better drugs against various diseases as the drugs we are developing now approach their product end of lifecycle. In particular, we are working on long term research projects for the purpose of eliminating persistent viruses thus providing true cures for many intractable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Herpes, Shingles, Epstein-Barr Virus, among others.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt should be noted that all of our studies to date were preliminary. Thus, the evidence we have developed is indicative, but not considered confirmative, of the capabilities of the nanoviricides technology's potential. With the success of these preliminary studies, the Company has decided to perform further pre-clinical studies that validate safety and efficacy of its materials and its various anti-viral drugs. Management intends to use capital and debt financing to enable the completion of these goals.\nDrug Development Plan\nThe Company intends to perform the regulatory filings and own all the regulatory licenses for the drugs it is currently developing. The Company will develop these drugs in part via subcontracts to TheraCour Pharma, Inc. ( TheraCour\u201d), the exclusive source for these nanomaterials. With sourcing of materials from TheraCour, the Company prefers to manufacture these drugs in our own facility. However, the Company may manufacture these drugs under subcontract arrangements with external manufacturers that carry the appropriate regulatory licenses and have appropriate capabilities. The Company intends to distribute these drugs via subcontracts with distributor companies or in partnership arrangements. The Company plans to market these drugs either on its own or in conjunction with marketing partners. The Company also plans to actively pursue co-development, as well as other licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies. Such agreements may entail up-front payments, milestone payments, royalties, and/or cost sharing, profit sharing and many other instruments that may bring early revenues to the Company. Such licensing and/or co-development agreements may shape the manufacturing and development options that the Company may pursue. The Company has received significant interest from certain pharmaceutical companies for potential licensing or co-development of some of our drug candidates. However, none of these distributor or co-development agreements is in place at the current time.\nManufacturing\nManufacturing of Research Materials\nNanomaterials that form the basis of our nanoviricide drugs are produced for research by TheraCour Pharma, Inc. at our facilities in Shelton, Connecticut, under our licensing agreement with TheraCour.\nManufacturing of Drugs\nThe Company intends to manufacture Injectable and Oral FluCide, HIVCide, Nanoviricide Eye Drops, HerpeCide, DengueCide, RabiCide as well as other drugs for pre-clinical animal studies and human clinical studies, in facilities owned by the Company. Our cGMP-capable manufacturing facility in Shelton, CT has sufficient capacity for supply of the pre-clinical and clinical batches needed for all of our drug candidates as and when they are anticipated to be needed. The Company may go to a cGMP third party provider for the final fill-and-finish of the clinical drug products.\nFor our future commercial products, we will need to develop additional manufacturing capabilities and establish additional third party suppliers to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates to undertake clinical trials and to manufacture sufficient quantities of any products that are approved for commercial sale. If we are unable to develop manufacturing capabilities internally or contract for large scale manufacturing with third parties on acceptable terms for our future antiviral products, our ability to conduct large-scale clinical trials and meet customer demand for commercial products would be adversely affected.\nWe believe that the technology we use to manufacture our products and compounds is proprietary. For our products, we may have to disclose all necessary aspects of this technology to contract manufacturers to enable them to manufacture the products and compounds for us. We plan to have discussions with manufacturers under non-disclosure and non-compete agreements that are intended to restrict them from using or revealing this technology, but we cannot be certain that these manufacturers will comply with these restrictions. In addition, these manufacturers could develop their own technology related to the work they perform for us that we may need to manufacture our products or compounds. We could be required to enter into an agreement with that manufacturer if we wanted to use that technology ourselves or allow another manufacturer to use that technology. The manufacturer could refuse to allow us to use their technology or could demand terms to use their technology that are not acceptable.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that we are in compliance with all material environmental regulations related to the manufacture of our products.\nCompetition\nOur products in development target a number of diseases and conditions that include several different kinds of viral infections. There are many commercially available products for these diseases and a large number of companies and institutions are spending considerable amounts of money and other resources to develop additional products to treat these diseases. Most of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. If we are able to successfully develop products, they would compete with existing products based primarily on:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>efficacy; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>safety; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>tolerability; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>acceptance by doctors; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>patient compliance; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>patent protection; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>ease of use; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>price; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>insurance and other reimbursement coverage; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>distribution; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>marketing; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>adaptability to various modes of dosing. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe current approved drugs for influenza include the neuraminidase inhibitors Tamiflu, Relenza, and Peramivir, anti-influenza drugs that are sold by Roche, Glaxo SmithKline (GSK), and BioCryst partners, respectively. In addition, M2 channel inhibitors, generic drugs include amantadine and rimantadine, both oral tablets that only inhibit the replication of the influenza A virus. There is significant viral resistance to the approved M2 channel inhibitors especially in the US. Several companies are developing anti-influenza drugs at present. Small chemical classes include neuraminidase inhibitors, M2-channel inhibitors, and RDRP inhibitors, among others. There are also monoclonal, polyclonal, and mixed antibodies, as well as enzymes as drugs in development.\nThere are a growing number of anti-HIV drugs being sold or in advanced stages of clinical development. Companies with HCV and HIV products include Gilead, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), in addition to several other pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms.\nThere are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of viral diseases of the external eye. A drug in development, called CTC-96, was shown to have little clinical benefit in published animal studies. Another drug in development, an Aganocide(tm) compound from NovaBay Pharma in collaboration with Alcon went through Phase II clinical studies. Alcon (a division of Novartis) discontinued further development of this drug following mixed results in a Phase II clinical trial. NovaBay regained the rights to it and continued further development. Aganocides, by virtue of their chemical structure, are generally not expected to be useful for any applications other than topical.\nThere are several drugs in the market that effectively control HSV cold sores and genital herpes lesions in most patients. These include the nucleoside analogues idoxuridine, vidarabine, acyclovir, famciclovir, and derivatives. However, their efficacy is limited or toxicities are high. Brincidofovir, based on the toxic drug cidofovir, is in development by Chimerix, but certain clinical trials involving brincidofovir have failed to meet the desired end points.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrently there are two accepted methods of rabies prophylaxis: rabies vaccines and rabies immune globulin, manufactured by many foreign and multinational manufacturers including Aventis Pasteur and Chiron (acquired by Novartis). These accepted methods will be the standard against which our new anti-rabies drug in development will be judged.\nIn order to compete successfully, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for therapeutic markets. Our products, even if successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d). The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these regulations, product development and the product approval process is very expensive and time consuming.\nThe FDA must license\u201d a drug before it can be sold in the United States. As of the date of this filing, the FDA has approved other nano-particulate drugs including Emend\u00ae by Merck and Rapamune\u00ae by Wyeth, as well as others. The general process for FDA approval is as follows:\nPreclinical Testing\nBefore we can test a drug candidate in humans, we must study the drug in laboratory experiments and in animals to generate data to support the drug's potential safety and benefits. We submit this data to the FDA in an investigational new drug application IND seeking their approval to test the compound in humans.\nClinical Trials\nIf the FDA accepts the investigational new drug application, we study the drug in human clinical trials to determine if the drug is safe and effective. These clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years to compile and are very expensive. These three phases, which are themselves subject to considerable regulation, are as follows:\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Phase I. The drug is given to a small number of healthy human subjects or patients to test for safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, distribution and excretion. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Phase II. The drug is given to a limited patient population to determine the effect of the drug in treating the disease, the best dose of the drug, and the possible side effects and safety risks of the drug. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Phase III. If a compound appears to be effective and safe in Phase II clinical trials, Phase III clinical trials are commenced to confirm those results. Phase III clinical trials are long-term, involve a significantly larger population, are conducted at numerous sites in different geographic regions and are carefully designed to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and benefits of a drug. It is not uncommon for a drug that appears promising in Phase II clinical trials to fail in the more rigorous and reliable Phase III clinical trials. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFDA Approval Process\nIf we believe that the data from the Phase 3 clinical trials show an adequate level of safety and effectiveness, we will file a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA seeking approval to sell the drug for a particular use. The FDA will review the NDA and often will hold a public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisors asks additional questions regarding the drug. This committee makes a recommendation to the FDA that is not binding on the FDA but is generally followed. If the FDA agrees that the compound has met the required level of safety and effectiveness for a particular use, it will allow us to sell the drug in the United States for that use. It is not unusual, however, for the FDA to reject an application because it believes that the drug is not safe enough or effective enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted is reliable or conclusive.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt any point in this process, the development of a drug could be stopped for a number of reasons including safety concerns and lack of treatment benefit. We cannot be certain that any clinical trials that we are currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future, will be completed successfully or within any specified time period. We may choose, or the FDA may require us, to delay or suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate does not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit.\nThe FDA may also require us to complete additional testing, provide additional data or information, improve our manufacturing processes, procedures or facilities or may require extensive post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or benefits of our product candidates if it determines that our new drug application does not contain adequate evidence of the safety and benefits of the drug. In addition, even if the FDA approves a drug, it could limit the uses of the drug. The FDA can withdraw approvals if it does not believe that we are complying with regulatory standards or if problems are uncovered or occur after approval.\nIn addition to obtaining FDA approval for each drug, we obtain FDA approval of the manufacturing facilities for any drug we sell, including those of companies who manufacture our drugs for us as well as our own and these facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA must also approve foreign establishments that manufacture products to be sold in the United States and these facilities are subject to periodic regulatory inspection.\nWe are also subject to other federal, state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. We use hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses and various radioactive compounds in our research and development activities and cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Any misuse or accidents involving these materials could lead to significant litigation, fines and penalties.\nDrugs are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the United States. In the European Union, there is a centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of a product in all countries in the European Union (which includes most major countries in Europe). If this procedure is not used, under a decentralized system, an approval in one country of the European Union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the European Union under a simplified application process at present. After approval under the centralized procedure, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries. These procedures are undergoing revision and modification at present. We have never received approval for a product in the European Union to date.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTime Schedules, Milestones and Development Costs\nIn the event that funding can be achieved, we shall endeavor to achieve completion of the following events within the next twelve months:\nThe status of each of our major research and development projects is as follows:\nTable 4: Drug Development Status\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>Project 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Injectable FluCide\u2122 against All Influenzas for Hospitalized Patients </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Current status </td> <td> </td> <td>We have declared a clinical candidate for influenza, NV-INF-1.

We are now engaging into advanced pre-clinical drug development, or IND-enabling studies. We are currently performing synthesis scale up studies and the studies required for the Chemistry, Manufacture and Controls section of an IND application.

These costs were paid from our available cash balances. Management has determined the results to be satisfactory. We now need to perform material characterization, pharmaco-kinetic, pharmaco-dynamic and toxicology studies, as well as extensive pre-clinical efficacy studies in both cell cultures and in animal models against a large number of different subtypes of Influenza viruses. We have presently budgeted this work plan at $2,500,000. If we are successful with the IND, we could begin Phase I and Phase II human clinical trials.

Revenues may occur as a result of licensing the drug to another pharmaceutical partner at this stage. After Phase III clinical trials completion, revenues are expected to occur after FDA approval and marketing of the drug. Revenues may occur earlier if Flucide is approved for use in other countries or if the BARDA authority determines that FluCide should be stockpiled in the USG CDC stockpile of drugs for defense against pandemic influenza.

At this time, very little resources have been allocated to these drugs. However should the early studies of any of these drug candidates provide an indication of high efficacy, the corresponding drug candidate will become a full-fledged drug development project and the Company will endeavor to seek additional funding for the necessary drug development work.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has limited experience with pharmaceutical drug development. Thus, our budget estimates are not based on experience, but rather based on advice given by our associates and consultants. As such these budget estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the actual work to be performed is not known at this time, other than a broad outline, as is normal with any scientific work. As further work is performed, additional work may become necessary or change in plans or workload may occur. Such changes may have an adverse impact on our estimated budget. Such changes may also have an adverse impact on our projected timeline of drug development.\nThe work-plan we have developed for the next twelve months is expected to enable us to file an investigational new drug application late in calendar year 2017 at best, and we believe we have the funding needed for the same. Our work-plan is extremely dependent on external factors, collaborations, and unanticipated delays can occur. We have experienced unanticipated delays in construction, post-construction modifications, and equipment set-up at our new Shelton facility that cumulatively effectively delayed our work-plan towards IND filing of our first drug candidate by more than 24months. However, we believe that most of those issues are now overcome.\nEnabling the cGMP facility has been the major issue for us in the past in our progress towards regulatory filings. We believe that this issue should be resolved in the ensuing fiscal year, with a kg-scale pilot cGMP-like\u201d facility coming on line. A non-GMP 200g scale production setup is being worked on at present. This scale is sufficient for all of our anti-herpes drug candidates, and the eye nanoviricide drug candidate. Thus we anticipate that our anti-herpes drug development can be accelerated as this production capacity develops. cGMP-like production for the 200g scale should be enabled in 3-6 months after the 200g scale optimizations are completed.\nDuring the scale up and optimization of our production level operations, we continue to work on a number of different polymer backbones ( nanomicelles\u201d) and several antiviral ligands in order to make sure that different formulation and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) needs can be met during the PK-PD programs for our various drug candidates. While this loads up our initial activities, it is expected to de-risk the further drug development towards IND or regulatory filings by making available backup drug candidates with different PK-PD profiles.\nThis work-plan is expected to reduce certain risks of drug development. We believe that this coming year's work-plan will lead us to obtain certain information about the safety and efficacy of some of the drugs under development in animal models. If our studies are not successful, we will have to develop additional drug candidates and perform further studies. If our studies are successful, then we expect to be able to undertake further studies in animal models to obtain necessary data regarding the pharmaco-kinetic and pharmaco-dynamic profiles of our drug candidates. We believe these data will then enable us to file an Investigational New Drug ( IND\u201d) application, towards the goal of obtaining FDA approval for testing the drugs in human patients.\nWe believe that because we are working in the infectious agents area, our studies will have objective response end points, and further, studies on acute viral infectious diseases are expected to be of relatively short durations. Our business plan is based on these assumptions. If we find that we have underestimated the time duration of our studies, or we have to undertake additional studies, due to various reasons within or outside of our control, this will grossly and adversely impact both our timelines and our financing needs.\nWe believe that we have sufficient funding for taking at least one of our drug candidates into initial clinical trials, and at least one or more additional candidates into the regulatory filing stage. We do not anticipate raising additional funds in the near future. When needed, management intends to use equity-based and debt financing, as required, to fund the Company's operations. Management also intends to pursue non-diluting funding sources such as government grants and contracts as well as licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional financial resources necessary to fund its anticipated obligations beyond the next twenty-four months.\nThe Company is considered to be a development stage company and will continue in the development stage until generating revenues from the sales of its products or services.\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe Company is a biopharmaceutical company and does not have any revenue for the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nComparison of the Year End June 30, 2016 to the Year Ended June 30, 2015\nRevenues - The Company is a non-revenue producing entity.\nOperating Expenses - General and administrative expenses increased $ 427,753 to $ 3,830,531 for the year ended June 30, 2016, from $3,402,778 for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses is generally attributable to an increase in stock compensation paid to employees and an increase in employment.\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $1,368,648 to $5,028,970 from $3,660,322 for the year ended June 30, 2015. This year to year increase is generally attributable to the increase in the number of employees and salaries, an increase in lab supplies and chemicals and an increase in stock compensation to research scientists.\nOther Income (Expenses)- Interest income was $62,638 and $160,859 for the years ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Interest income included interest on cash or cash equivalent deposits in interest-bearing account. Interest income decreased due to decrease in interest rates. The Company has incurred interest expense of $1,042,470 and $2,649,592 for the years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 respectively. The Company amortizes the discount on its Series B and Series C Debentures which were calculated at issuance. The Company recognized an amortization of bond discount expense of $1,427,218 and $1,175,344 for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome Taxes - There is no provision for income taxes due to ongoing operating losses. As of June 30, 2016, we had estimated cumulative tax benefits and development tax credits and other deferred tax credits resulting in a deferred tax asset of approximately $27,800,000. This amount has been offset by a full valuation allowance.\nNet Loss - For the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $10,724,629, or a basic loss per share of $0.19 and fully diluted loss per share of $0.19 compared to a net loss of $2,198,172, or a basic loss per share of $0.04 and a fully diluted loss per share of $0.09 for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in the Company's net loss from the year ended June 30, 2015 to the year ended June 30, 2016 of $8,526,457 is generally attributable to the smaller gain resulting from the change in fair value of derivatives, and offsetting decreases in noncash expenses and interest expenses and compensation paid in the Company's stock or other securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Reserves\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $24,162,185 and $31,467,748 at June 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. On the same dates, current liabilities outstanding totaled $6,744,014 and $600,895, respectively.\nSince inception, the Company has expended substantial resources on research and development. Consequently, we have sustained substantial losses.

If the Company is unable to obtain debt or equity financing to meet its cash needs it may have to severely limit its business plan by reducing the funds it hopes to expend on pre-clinical studies and trials, and/or research and development projects.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the Year End June 30, 2015 to the Year Ended June 30, 2014\nRevenues - The Company is a non-revenue producing entity.\nOperating Expenses - General and administrative expenses decreased $ 133,071 to $ 3,402,778 for the year ended June 30, 2015, from $3,535,849 for the year ended June 30, 2014. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is generally attributable to a decrease in the valuation of stock compensation paid to employees. The recent decrease in the Company's share price resulted in a decrease in the compensation costs recognized. These decreases were offset by a reimbursement of litigation costs paid of $150,000.\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2015 decreased $1,471,201 to $ 3,660,322 from $5,131,523 for the year ended June 30, 2014. The cost of research and development increased, however, this year to year decrease is generally attributable to a decrease in the valuation of stock compensation paid to research scientists which is calculated based upon the Company's stock price at the date of issuance or, in regards to the Company's Series A Preferred Shares, the estimated fair value as calculated based upon certain assumptions including the Company's share price (See Note 8 to the Financial Statements), and to certain chemical inventories, supplies and other costs paid in the prior fiscal year.\nOther Income (Expenses) - Interest income was $160,859 and $171,001 for the years ended June 30, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

The Company recognized an amortization of bond discount expense of $1,175,344 and $569,495 for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in bond discount expense arises from the Series C Debenture issued on July 2, 2014.\nIncome Taxes - There is no provision for income taxes due to ongoing operating losses.

Such losses are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and until such time, if ever, as the Company is able to attain sales levels sufficient to support its operations.\nResearch and Development Costs\nThe Company does not maintain separate accounting line items for each project in development. The Company maintains aggregate expense records for all research and development conducted. Because at this time all of the Company's projects share a common core material, the Company allocates expenses across all projects at each period-end for purposes of providing accounting basis for each project. Project costs are allocated based upon labor hours performed for each project.\nThe Company has signed several cooperative research and development agreements with different agencies and institutions.\nThe Company expects to enter into additional cooperative agreements with other governmental and non-governmental, academic, or commercial, agencies, institutions, and companies. There can be no assurance that a final agreement may be achieved and that the Company will execute any of these agreements. However, should any of these agreements materialize, the Company will implement a system to track these costs by project and account for these projects as customer-sponsored activities and show these project costs separately.\nThe following table 3 summarizes the primary components of our research and development expenses as allocated, during the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>Table 3: R&D Cost Allocations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nJune 30, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nJune 30, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nJune 30, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>All Influenzas: FluCide\u2122 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>,670,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,629,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>EKC-Cide\u2122, other Eye Viral Infections </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,670,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>HIV-Cide\u2122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>414,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Herpes infections </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,600,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>670,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>570,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dengue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>600,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other (Ebola, and other projects) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,730 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unallocated stock compensation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>588,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>761,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,347,793 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,028,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,660,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,131,523 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company currently has no long-term debt other than the Series B Convertible Debentures and the Series C Convertible Debentures.\nThus, the Company has ended the year on a strong financial footing. We have not engaged in any additional financings. We believe that we will not need to raise additional capital until after initial human clinical trials of our first drug candidate. We project, based on various estimates that we have obtained, that our current available financing is sufficient for accomplishing the goal of filing one or possibly two IND or equivalent regulatory applications, and initial human clinical trials in at least one of our drug programs. Two of our drug programs, namely our Shingles Skin Cream, and our HerpeCide skin cream for herpes labialis, are expected to enter IND-enabling studies soon. We anticipate that these drug candidates will move forward into IND or equivalent regulatory filings, and ensuing human clinical trials. As these drug candidates are advancing into the clinic, we believe that our additional drug candidates, including two more drug candidates in the HerpeCide program, and the two drug candidates in the FluCide program, will also move forward into IND-enabling studies. We are thus poised for strong growth with a number of drug candidates in a number of disease indications.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnticipated Budgets and Expenditures in the Near Future\nFinancings\nThe Company has performed no equity based raises or debentures or loans in the reported time period. The Company had no revenues in the reported time period. Thus the Company's operating expenditures were supported from cash in hand and using stock-based compensation where appropriate.\nRequirement for Additional Capital\nAs of June 30, 2016, we have a cash and cash equivalent balance of $24,162,185 that is expected to be sufficient to fund our currently budgeted operations for more than the next twenty four months.\nThe Company believes that given its rate of expenditures, and based on its budget projections, the current cash in hand is sufficient to last for at least the next 24 months, and the Company estimates that it should be able to advance at least one or possibly two of its drug candidates into initial human clinical trials with the available cash. The Company estimates that it will need additional funding to continue further development of its drug candidates through human clinical trials if it does not form a collaborative licensing or partnership agreement with a party that would provide such funding, such as Big pharma.\nWe believe we currently have sufficient funds on hand to take at least one drug candidate into initial human clinical trials, and at least one or two additional candidates into regulatory submissions stage. We believe we will be pursuing (i) Skin Cream for Shingles and (ii) Skin Cream for Herpes Labialis (or Recurrent Herpes Labialis) as our early candidates for an IND or equivalent regulatory submission and for initiating human clinical trials.\nBased on our current rate of expenditures and anticipated changes, we have estimated a total cash expenditure budget of approximately $8M for the next 12 months, of which approximately $6M is expected to go towards research and development for our drug candidates, including IND-enabling studies of two of our lead drug candidates, namely Skin Cream for Topical Treatment of Shingles, and HerpeCide Skin Cream for Topical Treatment of Herpes Labialis ( cold sores, HSV-1), and approximately $2M is budgeted for general and administrative expenses.\nThereafter, we estimate that we may need approximately an additional $10M to $15M for human clinical development of the nanoviricide antiviral eye drops, Injectable FluCide, oral FluCide and DengueCide drug candidates towards IND filing over the next 36-48 months. The additional funds will also be needed to pay additional personnel, increased subcontract costs related to the expansion and further development of our drug pipeline, and for additional capital and operational expenditures required to file the corresponding IND applications.\nFurther, we anticipate incurring additional capital costs in the upcoming eighteen months for further improvements at our 1 Controls Drive, Shelton, Ct. facility, to support an initial new drug application filing with the FDA in accordance with our business plans.\nWe anticipate that we will incur the following additional cash-based expenses over the next 24 months.\n1. Planned Research and Development Costs of $4,000,000: Planned costs for in-vivo and in-vitro studies for the four indications in HerpeCide program, two indications in FluCide program, Eye Nanoviricide, DengueCide, and HIVCide, and Other programs (see Table 2).\nIncludes staffing costs of approximately $3,500,000, for the scientific staff and consulting firms to assist with FDA compliance, material characterization, pharmaco-kinetic, pharmaco-dynamic and toxicology studies, and other items related to FDA compliance, as required for development of necessary data for filing an Investigational New Drug with the United States Food and Drug Administration.\n2. Corporate overhead of $4,000,000: This amount includes budgeted office salaries, legal, accounting, investor relations, public relations, and other costs expected to be incurred by being a public reporting company.\n3. Capital costs of $1,000,000: This is the estimated cost for additional equipment and laboratory improvements.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n4. Clinical Trials Costs budgeted at $5,000,000 for the Skin Cream for Shingles and an additional $5,000,000 costs for clinical trials that may extend beyond the 24 month timeframe, as follows:\n4a. If and when we initiate human clinical trials for a Topical HerpeCide, we anticipate approximately $1 million total costs for the Phase I clinical trials, and approximately $2 million for the Phase II (study in recruited patients presenting with disease) clinical trials. In a subsequent year, if Phase I and Phase II are successful, we anticipate approximately $10 million for Phase III human clinical trials. These estimates are based on rough quotes from potential investigators, and assumptions relative to additional costs. These estimates assume that Topical HerpeCide is highly effective and therefore would require relatively few patients in each arm of the each trial in order to establish statistically significant results.\n4b. If and when we initiate human clinical trials for Injectable FluCide, we anticipate approximately $2 million total costs for the Phase I clinical trials, and approximately $5 million for the Phase IIa (virus challenge human efficacy study) clinical trials. In a subsequent year, if Phase I and Phase IIa are successful, we anticipate approximately $10 million for Phase IIb human clinical trials. These estimates are based on rough quotes from potential investigators, and assumptions relative to additional costs. These estimates assume that FluCide is highly effective and therefore would require relatively few patients in each arm of the each trial in order to establish statistically significant results.\nWe therefore believe that we have sufficient funds in hand to take two of the four Topical HerpeCide drug candidates and possibly Injectable FluCide through the initial human clinical trials.\nThe Company has limited experience with pharmaceutical drug development. Thus, our budget estimates are not based on experience, but rather based on advice given by our associates and consultants. As such these budget estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the actual work to be performed is not known at this time, other than a broad outline, as is normal with any scientific work. As further work is performed, additional work may become necessary or change in plans or workload may occur. Such changes may have an adverse impact on our estimated budget. Such changes may also have an adverse impact on our projected timeline of drug development.\nWe believe that this coming year's work-plan will lead us to obtain certain information about the safety and efficacy of some of the drugs under development in animal models. If our studies are not successful, we will have to develop additional drug candidates and perform further studies. If our studies are successful, then we expect to be able to undertake further studies in animal models to obtain necessary data regarding the pharmaco-kinetic and pharmaco-dynamic profiles of our drug candidates. We believe these data will then enable us to file an Investigational New Drug application, towards the goal of obtaining FDA approval for testing the drugs in human patients.\nOur strategy is to minimize capital expenditure. We therefore rely on third party collaborations for the testing of our drug candidates. We continue to engage with our previous collaborators.\nOur animal efficacy studies as well as safety/toxicology studies are performed by third parties. We opt into drug developments against specific disease indications for which we have appropriate partners that can perform the necessary cell culture and animal efficacy studies.\nThe Company reports summaries of its studies as the data becomes available to the Company, after analyzing and verifying same, in its press releases. The studies of biological testing of materials provide information that is relatively easy to understand and therefore readily reported. In addition, we continue to engage in substantial work that is needed for the optimization of synthesis routes and for the chemical characterization of the nanoviricide drug candidates. We also continue to work on improving the drug candidates and the virus binding ligands where necessary. We continue to work on creating the information needed for the development of controlled chemical synthesis procedures that is vital for developing c-GMP manufacturing processes.\nWe cannot accurately project the timeline of when we would be able to take a drug candidate into clinical studies, nor can we predict when we may be able to achieve our first drug approval, if any. As such we do not provide any guidance on expected timelines. We have no experience in having taken a single drug through the US FDA or any international drug approval process as of now. As such, we may not be able to estimate the time or cost of these studies accurately. However, we try to do our best by using expert consultants and preparing reasonable estimates based on quotations from various contract research organizations.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur timelines depend upon several assumptions, many of which are outside the control of the Company, and thus are subject to delays.\nManagement intends to use capital and debt financing, as required, to fund the Company's operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional capital resources necessary to fund its anticipated obligations for the next twelve months.\nThe Company is considered to be a development stage company and will continue in the development stage until it generates revenues from the sales of its products or services.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nPublic Auditors and Corporate Governance\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is EisnerAmper, LLP. Our previous auditor firm, namely Li & Company was deregistered by the PCAOB this year. As a result, our FY2014 accounts have been re-audited this year by EisnerAmper, LLP as required by the SEC and PCAOB rules.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nResearch and Development - Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the preclinical and or clinical trials of drug candidates, compensation and other expenses for research and development, personnel, supplies and development materials, costs for consultants and related contract research and facility costs. Expenditures relating to research and development are expensed as incurred.\nAccounting for Stock Based Compensation - The Company follows the provisions of ASC 718 - Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement of compensation expense for all shared-based payment awards made to employees and non-employee directors, including employee stock options. Shared-based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 and is generally recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures.\nAccounting for Non-Employee Stock Based Compensation - The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under guidance of section 505-50-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( FASB ASC Section 505-50-30\u201d). Pursuant to FASB ASC Section 505-50-30, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718), which includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Specifically, ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). It also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This ASU requires retrospective adoption and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.", "summary": "- The Company's drug development business model was formed in May 2005 with a license to the patents and intellectual property held by TheraCour Pharma, Inc., that enabled creation of drugs engineered specifically to combat viral diseases in humans.\n- The Company was granted a worldwide exclusive perpetual license to this technology for several drugs with specific targeting mechanisms in perpetuity for the treatment of the following human viral diseases: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Rabies, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Influenza and Asian Bird Flu Virus.\n- The Company plans to develop several drugs through the preclinical studies and clinical trial phases with the goal of eventually obtaining approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA\u201d) and International regulatory agencies for these drugs.\n- The seeking of these regulatory approvals would only come when and if one or more of our drugs, now in early stage of pre-clinical development, has significantly advanced through the US FDA and international regulatory process.\n- If and as these advances occur, the Company may attempt to partner with more established pharmaceutical companies to advance the various drugs through the approval process.", "item_7_tables": "Table 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>efficacy; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>safety; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>tolerability; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>acceptance by doctors; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>patient compliance; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>patent protection; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>ease of use; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>price; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>insurance and other reimbursement coverage; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>distribution; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>marketing; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>adaptability to various modes of dosing. </td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein and in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. Readers should carefully review the risk factors disclosed in this Form 10-K and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC.\nAs used in this report, the terms Company\u201d, we\u201d, our\u201d, us\u201d and NNVC\u201d refer to Nanoviricides, Inc., a Nevada corporation.\nPRELIMINARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which we indicate by words or phrases such as anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d will,\u201d we believe,\u201d NNVC believes,\u201d management believes\u201d and similar language.

Actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. We base the forward-looking statements on information currently available to us, and we assume no obligation to update them.\nInvestors are also advised to refer to the information in our previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), especially on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, in which we discuss in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. As such, investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks and uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions.\nManagement's Plan of Operation\nThe Company's drug development business model was formed in May 2005 with a license to the patents and intellectual property held by TheraCour Pharma, Inc., that enabled creation of drugs engineered specifically to combat viral diseases in humans. This exclusive license from TheraCour Pharma serves as a foundation for our intellectual property. The Company was granted a worldwide exclusive perpetual license to this technology for several drugs with specific targeting mechanisms in perpetuity for the treatment of the following human viral diseases: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Rabies, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Influenza and Asian Bird Flu Virus. The Company has entered into an Additional License Agreement with TheraCour granting the Company the exclusive licenses in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the additional virus types for Dengue viruses, Japanese Encephalitis virus, West Nile Virus, Viruses causing viral Conjunctivitis (a disease of the eye) and Ocular Herpes, and Ebola/Marburg viruses. The Company may want to add further virus types to its drug pipeline. The Company would then need to negotiate with TheraCour an amendment to the Licensing Agreement to include those of such additional viruses that the Company determines it wants to follow for further development. We are seeking to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery pre-clinical development programs and through an in-licensing strategy.\n 48 \nThe Company plans to develop several drugs through the preclinical studies and clinical trial phases with the goal of eventually obtaining approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) and International regulatory agencies for these drugs. The Company plans, when appropriate, to seek regulatory approvals in several international markets, including developed markets such as Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Emerging Regions such as Southeast Asia, India, China, Central and South America, as well as the African subcontinent. The seeking of these regulatory approvals would only come when and if one or more of our drugs, now in early stage of pre-clinical development, has significantly advanced through the US FDA and international regulatory process. If and as these advances occur, the Company may attempt to partner with more established pharmaceutical companies to advance the various drugs through the approval process.\nThe Company intends to perform the regulatory filings and own all the regulatory licenses for the drugs it is currently developing. The Company will develop these drugs in part via subcontracts to TheraCour Pharma, Inc., the exclusive source for these nanomaterials. The Company may manufacture these drugs itself, or under subcontract arrangements with external manufacturers that carry the appropriate regulatory licenses and have appropriate capabilities. The Company intends to distribute these drugs via subcontracts with distributor companies or in partnership arrangements. The Company plans to market these drugs either on its own or in conjunction with marketing partners. The Company also plans to actively pursue co-development, as well as other licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies. Such agreements may entail up-front payments, milestone payments, royalties, and/or cost sharing, profit sharing and many other instruments that may bring early revenues to the Company. Such licensing and/or co-development agreements may shape the manufacturing and development options that the Company may pursue. The Company has received significant interest from certain pharmaceutical companies for potential licensing or co-development of some of our drug candidates. However, none of these distributor or co-development agreements is in place at the current time.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to develop effective nanoviricides, or if developed, that we will have sufficient resources to be able to successfully manufacture and market these products to commence revenue-generating operations.\nThere can be no assurance that other developments in the field would not impact our business plan adversely. For example, successful creation and availability of an effective vaccine may reduce the potential market size for a particular viral disease.\nOur goal, which we can give no assurance that we will achieve, is for NanoViricides, Inc. to become the premier company developing highly safe and effective drugs that employ an integrated multiplicity of actions as enabled by our nanomedicine approach for anti-viral therapy.\nTo date, we have engaged in organizational activities; developing and sourcing compounds and preparing nano-materials; and experimentation involving preclinical studies using cell cultures and animals. We have generated funding through the issuances of debt and the sales of securities under our shelf registration and the private placement of common stock (See, Item 5). The Company does not currently have any long term debt, other than Series B Convertible Debentures of $6M and the Series C Convertible Debentures of $5M presented in the Financial Statements and more fully described herein. We have not generated any revenues and we do not expect to generate revenues in the near future. We may not be successful in developing our drugs and start selling our products when planned, or we may not become profitable in the future. We have incurred net losses in each fiscal period since inception of our operations.\n 49 \nOur Collaborations and Service Contract Agreements\nOur development model is to employ collaborations and service contract relationships with renowned academic labs, government labs, as well as service contracts with external service providers in order to minimize our capital requirements.\nAll of our agreements provide for the evaluation of Nanoviricides\u00ae substances created and provided by the Company to the Laboratory (or Collaborator). In general, the Laboratory is compensated for certain material and personnel costs for these evaluations. The evaluations involve in vitro and in vivo scientific studies at the Laboratory using their established protocols. In some cases, the Company provides scientific input regarding certain modifications to their protocols as may be needed. The Laboratory returns the results and data to the Company. The Laboratory is allowed to publish the results after allowing time for the Company to protect intellectual property (IP) as needed. The Company sends nanoviricides as well as positive control (i.e. known therapeutics) and negative control (i.e. known not to work) compounds as needed in a fully formulated, ready to use form, to the Laboratory. All IP related to the nanoviricide materials, their formulations and reformulations, and their usage, rests with the Company. Any IP developed by the Laboratory regarding their own know-how, such as laboratory tests, their modifications, etc. rests with the Laboratory. Joint inventions are treated as per applicable US Laws.\nThe Company tries to choose the scientific laboratories with the most appropriate facilities and know-how relating to a particular field for the evaluation of an antiviral agent developed by the Company. The Company also tries to work with more than one laboratory for the evaluation of an antiviral agent developed by the Company. The Company also tries to work with more than one laboratory for a given group of viruses whenever possible. We seek to improve confidence by obtaining independent datasets for corroboration of the efficacy and safety of the nanoviricides we develop. In addition, the Company is not dependent on a particular Laboratory for the development of any specific drug candidate in our product pipeline.\nTo date, the Company has engaged in non-GLP Efficacy and Safety evaluations in both in vitro (cell culture models) and in vivo (animal models) of our different Nanoviricides\u00ae at different laboratories.\nOur current relationships include:\nFor Herpes Virus Infections, and for Viral Diseases of the Eye (Adenoviruses, Herpesviruses - Epidemic Kerato-conjunctivitis (EKC), Herpes Keratitis):\n 1. The CORL at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI \n 2. The Campbell Lab at the University of Pittsburgh, PA \n 3.

Public Health England, UK. \n 50 \nIn addition, we have signed an agreement with the Biologics Consulting Group (BCG), Alexandria, Virginia, to help us with the US FDA applications processes, and with the development of applications as well as drug development programs, as needed. We have also signed an agreement with Australian Biologics Pty, Ltd. to help us with the regulatory processes in Australia.\nWe have also signed a Master Services Agreement with BASi to perform cGLP and GLP-like safety and toxicological studies that are necessary for filing an IND for each of our drugs.\nIn April 2014, we finalized a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with Public Health England (PHE), UK, the British government's equivalent of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, This agreement allows for animal efficacy evaluation of various nanoviricides drug candidates against viruses of mutual interest at the BSL2, BSL3 or BSL4 facilities at PHE-UK as the case may be.\nWe have also recently signed a Master Services Agreement with Integrated Biotherapeutics, Inc. ( IBT\u201d), Gaithersburg, MD, a provider of pre-clinical anti-viral evaluation services. We intend to perform certain influenza drug candidate studies at IBT.\nWe have additional collaborations in the process of formalization. We have also signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement with the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM.\nWe typically employ more than one external laboratory to perform testing for a particular disease agent in order to limit possible laboratory level bias. We previously had a collaborative research agreement with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Dr. Putnak Lab, for work on dengue viruses. This agreement has since lapsed, but we believe it can be reactivated at an opportune time.\nTo date, we have entered into the following collaborations.\nHSV-1 and HSV-2 Nanoviricides Efficacy Evaluation Agreement with the Collaborative Ophthalmic Research Laboratories (CORL) at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI.\nIn January 2016, we signed an agreement with CORL. Under this agreement, CORL will perform evaluation of efficacy of our nanoviricides drug candidates in cell culture assays as well as in small animal studies towards the goal of filing an IND application for ocular Herpes Keratitis, and possibly for recurrent Herpes Labialis (RHL, cold sores\u201d). The studies will be performed in the laboratory of Dr. Curtis Brandt, an expert in herpes simplex virus infections and in evaluating anti-viral agents.\nEvaluation of Nanoviricides Efficacy Against Ocular Viral Infections; Agreement with the Campbell Lab at the University of Pittsburgh, PA\nIn January 2016, we signed an agreement with the Campbell Lab. Under this Agreement, the Campbell Lab will perform evaluation of efficacy of our nanoviricides drug candidates in cell culture assays against various strains of HSV-1, HSV-2, and Adenoviruses. Successful candidates will be further evaluated for efficacy in industry standard ocular animal models for Herpes Keratitis as well as Adenoviral Epidemic KeratoConjunctivitis (EKC), towards the goal of filing IND application(s) for ocular Herpes Keratitis, and for EKC. The research will be performed in the Charles T. Campbell Ophthalmic Microbiology Laboratory by Dr. Eric Romanowski, Research Director. Dr. Romanowski has extensive experience in ocular virus infections and anti-viral agents discovery.\nAgreement with the Department of Ophthalmology, Baylor University College of Medicine, Houston, TX\nIn February 2016, we signed an agreement with the Pflugfelder Lab at Baylor. Under this Agreement, the Lab will perform confirmatory testing of certain nanoviricides for efficacy in a small animal model of Herpes Keratitis. The research will be supervised by Dr. Stephen Pflugfelder, Professor of Ophthalmology and the James and Margaret Elkins Chair in Ophthalmology at Baylor. Dr. Pflugfelder has extensive experience in ophthalmological research as well as in ocular drug development, including conducting clinical trials. The research will be performed in the laboratories of the Department of Ophthalmology. This program is currently on hold until appropriate personnel are hired at the Lab.\n 51 \nResearch and Development Agreement with Professor Ken Rosenthal's laboratory at the Northeastern Ohio Medical University (NEOMED, formerly called NEOUCOM)\nOn May 13, 2010, the Company announced that it had signed a research and development agreement with Professor Ken Rosenthal's laboratory at the Northeastern Ohio Medical University (NEOMED). Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Professor Rosenthal and NEOMED will evaluate the effectiveness of nanoviricides drug candidates against Herpes Simplex Viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2, in both cell culture and animal models. The focus of this evaluation will be the development of drug candidates against herpes skin infections (oral and genital herpes). Dr. Ken Rosenthal is a professor of microbiology, immunology and biochemistry at NEOMED. He is a leading researcher in the field of herpes viruses. His laboratory has developed an improved mouse model of skin-infection with HSV to follow the disease progression. This model has been shown to provide highly uniform and reproducible results. A uniform disease pattern including onset of lesions and further progression to zosteriform lesions is observed in all animals in this model. This uniformity makes it an ideal model for comparative testing of various drug candidates which, the Company believes, can be expected to lead to a broad-spectrum anti-HSV antiviral treatment capable of attacking both HSV-1 and HSV-2.\nOn August 16, 2010, the Company reported that its anti-Herpes drug candidates demonstrated significant efficacy in the recently completed cell culture studies in Dr. Rosenthal Lab at NEOMED. Several of the anti-Herpes nanoviricides\u00ae demonstrated a dose-dependent maximal inhibition of Herpes virus infectivity in a cell culture model. Almost complete inhibition of the virus production was observed at clinically usable concentrations. These studies employed the H129 strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). H129 is an encephalitic strain that closely resembles a clinical isolate; it is known to be more virulent than classic HSV-1 laboratory strains. The H129 strain will be used in subsequent animal testing of nanoviricides. Since then the Company was optimizing formulations for use in the dermal HSV-1 H129c infection animal model in the Rosenthal lab. The Company also continued to further optimize the anti-herpes nanoviricides. Our herpes program was run at a lower priority than other programs until recently. In April 2015, after only 4 cycles of SAR (Structure-Activity-Relationship based improvements), our anti-herpes nanoviricides demonstrated strong effectiveness in the lethal HSV-1 H129c dermal infection model in the Rosenthal Lab at NEOMED. Treatment with certain nanoviricides caused significant improvements in the clinical observations, and led to >85% survival of the infected animals, wherein 100% of the untreated animals died within 10 days. In August 2015, the Company reported that these results were reproduced in dermal animal model at Transpharm, with 100% of the nanoviricides treated animals surviving.\nThe HerpeCide program has thus advanced to the lead identification stage now. We are now working on this program with a high priority, in parallel with our Injectable FluCide program.\nProfessor Rosenthal retired in December 2014, continued his laboratory and our R&D through April 2015, and has closed the lab thereafter. He is now Professor at Roseman University of Health Sciences College of Medicine, NV. He continues as Professor Emeritus at Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED).\nPre-Clinical Services Agreement with TransPharm\nIn January 2015, we commenced a master pre-clinical studies agreement with Transpharm Preclinical Solutions ( TransPharm\u201d), a pre-clinical research services organization (CRO) in Jackson, MI. TransPharm has and will perform the topical dermal efficacy studies for our anti-HSV drug candidates. The agreement can also be extended to other indications for which TransPharm may already have an animal model or may be able to establish an animal model.\nRegulatory Consulting and Advisory Agreement with Biologics Consulting Group, VA (BCG).\nIn July 2011 we signed an agreement with Biologics Consulting Group to help us with our regulatory strategy and filings. Several of the members of the BCG faculty had experience working as part of the US FDA.\nBCG has helped us with the pre-IND filing for our anti-Influenza drug candidate, and for developing the herpesvirus treatment strategy.\nIn July 2012 we signed an agreement with Australian Biologics Pty Ltd to help us with our regulatory strategy and filings in Australia, and to help us with potentially developing clinical trials programs in Australia.\n 52 \nTechnical Testing Agreement, dated December 15, 2007, between The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research ( Feinstein\u201d) and NanoViricides, Inc.\nThe term of this agreement ran from December 17, 2007 through December 31, 2010. Feinstein performed animal studies testing services on epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis and related viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. All test results and inventions resulting from the tests remained property of the Company. Inventions resulting from the testing services would be determined by an independent patent counsel with the Company retaining a commercial license on such inventions. The Company paid Feinstein an amount equal to $40,090.19 for the costs associated with the research.\nThe first study of nanoviricide effectiveness against adenoviral EKC was completed at Feinstein in June, 2008. The study indicated that the best nanoviricide drug candidate showed excellent clearance of clinical signs of the disease, viz. redness of the eye as well as sticky exudates, in a short time after treatment.\nAnti-Influenza Drug Development Agreement with the Webster Lab at St Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN\nIn May 2016, we signed an agreement with the Webster Lab at St. Jude Children's Hospital. Under this Agreement, the Webster Lab will evaluate nanoviricide drug candidates in cell culture studies against a large number of Influenza viruses to optimize the efficacy and broad-spectrum for a clinical development candidate. Variations on the previously selected ligand in NV-INF-1 and NV-INF-2 will be performed if necessary.\nThe testing of these candidates for anti-influenza activity will be performed in the laboratory of Dr. Elena Govorkova in collaboration with Dr. Robert G. Webster and will include both in vitro and in vivo studies. They have extensive experience in influenza virus infections with a large number of different influenza strains, and in anti-viral agents discovery. The overall objective of these studies will be to help select clinical drug development candidates for the treatment of influenza virus in humans, using both the injectable and oral administration routes. Injectable administration is preferable for hospitalized patients that are extremely sick, while oral administration is preferred for out-patients.\nThe most optimal candidate will then be evaluated against a wide variety of Influenza viruses in small animal efficacy studies with a goal of obtaining data for an IND submission for Injectable FluCide drug candidate for severely ill hospitalized patients, and also for Oral FluCide drug candidate for out-patients with Influenza.\nSafety/Toxicology Studies Agreement with BASi\nIn September 2014, we signed an agreement with BASi. BASi is a pre-clinical contract services organization that specializes in cGLP and GLP-like safety and toxicological testing of drug candidates and preparation of the Tox Package\u201d section of an IND application. BASi performed a GLP-like preliminary safety and toxicology study in which there were no significant compound related adverse events found. Our safety and toxicology studies for FluCide are being conducted by BASi for submission with an IND application. BASi will also perform the safety toxicology studies for the anti-herpes nanoviricide drug candidates in our HerpeCide program.\nResearch and Development Agreement with the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley)\nOn February 16, 2010, the Company announced that it had signed a research and development agreement with Dr. Eva Harris's laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley). Under this agreement, Dr. Harris and coworkers will evaluate the effectiveness of nanoviricides\u00ae drug candidates against various dengue viruses. Cell culture models as well as in vivo animal studies will be employed for testing the drug candidates. Dr. Eva Harris is a Professor of Infectious Diseases at UC Berkeley. She is a leading researcher in the field of dengue. Her group has developed a unique animal model for dengue virus infection and disease that effectively emulates the pathology seen in humans. In particular, the critical problem of dengue virus infection, called Antibody-Dependent Enhancement\u201d (ADE), is reproduced in this animal model. When a person who was previously infected with one serotype of dengue virus is later infected by a different serotype, the antibodies produced by the immune system can lead to increased severity of the second dengue infection, instead of controlling it. ADE thus can lead to severe dengue disease or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). This agreement was extended in 2014.\n 53 \nMaster Services Agreement, dated August 31, 2009, by and between Southern Research Institute ( Southern\u201d) and NanoViricides, Inc.\nThe term of this agreement was three years from its execution. The Company agrees to supply necessary quantities of its products in order for Southern to complete specific studies as to the efficacy and safety of the Company's compounds. The Company shall pay charges associated with each task order and provide payment in the amount and as indicated therein. Under this agreement, Southern will estimate the work load and invoices for additional task orders, subject to the Company's agreement on costs.\nThe Company's anti-HIV drug testing in cell cultures is performed at the Southern Research Institute in Frederick, MD.\nCooperative Research and Development Agreement for Material Transfer, dated October 15, 2007, between NanoViricides, Inc. and United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease ( Laboratory\u201d).\nThe term of the agreement was for one year initially and extended for an additional year. It has been extended again, based on positive results. The Company shall invent, develop, and provide to the laboratory, Nanoviricides\u00ae that are expected to be capable of attacking a multiplicity of different Ebola and Marburg viruses. The Laboratory shall assess in vitro and in vivo activity of the anti-Ebola Nanoviricides\u00ae provided against the virus.\nPreliminary studies began in February 2008. Certain nanoviricides candidates were found to be highly successful against Ebola virus in pre-clinical cell culture studies. Ebola virus is known to produce, in vivo, a soluble decoy protein that is a portion of its surface glycoprotein. If the nanoviricides that were successful in the in vitro studies bind to the decoy protein portion of the Ebola virus envelope, then we would expect that the nanoviricides would be neutralized in vivo by the decoy protein. We are therefore developing novel ligands that would potentially bind to the Ebola virus glycoprotein portion that is known to be not a part of the decoy protein. The MTA was extended for another year in October, 2009 to continue these studies.\nCooperative Research and Development Agreement for Material Transfer, dated October, 2014, between NanoViricides, Inc. and United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease ( Laboratory\u201d).\nThe term of the agreement is for one year. The Company shall invent, develop, and provide to the laboratory, nanoviricides\u00ae that are expected to be capable of attacking a multiplicity of different Ebola and Marburg viruses. The Laboratory shall assess in vitro and in vivo activity of the anti-Ebola Nanoviricides\u00ae provided against the virus.\nThere is no payment by the Company to the Laboratory, nor from the Laboratory to the Company. USAMRIID has federal funding to support their part of the work.\nThe Company has lowered the priority of this program during the recent economic crisis in order to use our resources most effectively.\nClinical Study Agreement, dated May 6, 2009, between NanoViricides, Inc. and TheVac, LLC. ( Laboratory\u201d).\nOn May 6, 2009, the Company entered into a Clinical Study Agreement with THEVAC, LLC, a company affiliated with the Emerging Technology Center of the Louisiana State University. TheVac performed biological testing of certain anti-herpes nanoviricides. TheVac conducted studies on the effect of anti-herpes nanoviricide drug candidates against certain herpes simplex viruses in cell culture models. The studies indicated a >99.9% reduction in HSV-1 in cell culture assays by certain of our nanoviricide drug candidates. The Company paid the Laboratory the amount of $55,000 for the studies.\nMaterials Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between NanoViricides, Inc. and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe CRADA provided that the CDC would test the efficacy of the Company's drug candidates against rabies. The nanoviricides provided by the Company remained its proprietary information. The CDC retains rights to certain inventions that may be conceived during testing. The Company paid the CDC an amount equal to approximately $10,000 for the costs associated with the research.\n 54 \nOther Agreements and Contracts\nThe Company continues to receive or obtain and evaluate various research and drug development collaborations with a number of parties that include government institutions, academic labs, contract service organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and other potential business collaborators or partners in the normal course of business. We have also received requests for material for testing under Material Testing Agreements (MTAs) from certain agencies. However, there can be no assurance that a final agreement may be forthcoming.\nFurther, the Company has had preliminary negotiations and discussions with other pharma and non-pharma commercial enterprises regarding commercial projects based on the Company's technologies.\nWe have developed lead drug candidates against a number of viral diseases. Proof-of-principle efficacy studies in animals have been conducted successfully in many of these.\nKARD Scientific, LLC, Beverly, MA has performed several of the animal studies for evaluation of efficacy and of preliminary safety of our nanoviricides drug candidates against Influenza and HIV to date. KARD's contract services operations were closed down by its owner, Dr. Krishna Menon, due to personal reasons in 2014.\nPreviously, in December, 2005, the Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi (NIHE), a unit of the Vietnamese Government's Ministry of Health. This Memorandum of Understanding calls for cooperation in the development and testing of certain nanoviricides. The parties agreed that NanoViricides will retain all intellectual property rights with respect to any resulting product and that the initial target would be the development of drugs against H5N1 (avian influenza). NIHE thereafter requested that we develop a drug for rabies, a request to which we agreed. The initial phase of this agreement called first for laboratory testing, followed by animal testing of several drug candidates developed by the Company. Preliminary laboratory testing of our anti-Influenza drug candidates in the FluCide\u2122 program were successfully performed at the laboratories of the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi (NIHE), against both clade 1 and clade 2 of H5N1 virus isolated in Vietnam. Successful animal testing of RabiCide-ITM, the Company's rabies drug, was performed in Vietnam during the first half of 2007, and reproducibly repeated in 2008. Rabies testing can safely be done at their BSL2 facility. The H5N1 animal testing requires a BSL3 (biological safety laboratory level 3) laboratory. NIHE has acquired a BSL3 animal testing capacity during 2008.\nWe have finalized execution of a Materials Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (M-CRADA) with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA in July, 2008. This agreement was initiated based on our success against Rabies in the animal studies conducted at NIHE Vietnam. Preliminary animal studies against Rabies were expected to start in the last quarter of calendar year 2009 or first quarter of calendar year 2010. The Company has lowered the priority of this program during the recent economic crisis in order to use our resources most effectively. Subsequent to the agreement execution, the Company has supplied certain materials to CDC for testing. This testing, if successful, is expected to expand to involve potential use of nanoviricides as (1) a post- infection therapeutic drug against rabies, possibly in conjunction with a rabies vaccine, and (2) a post-exposure prophylactic drug against rabies, to replace costly human or monoclonal antibodies, possibly in conjunction with a rabies vaccine. To date, there is no effective post-infection therapeutic against rabies. Post-exposure prophylaxis market has been estimated to be as much $300M to $500M worldwide.\nWe finalized a CRADA with Walter Reed Army Institutes of Research (WRAIR) to develop collaboratively antiviral agents against all four types of dengue viruses in April, 2007. Preliminary work has commenced under this CRADA. This CRADA will need to be renegotiated due to changes in funding requirements at WRAIR. The Company has not renewed this agreement.\nOn May 17, 2010, the Company announced that it had signed a research and development agreement with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), for the testing of its anti-HIV drug candidates. Most recently, the Company's anti-HIV injectables animal testing was performed by KARD Scientific.\n 55 \nThe above collaborations, subcontract, or service contract agreements, and our on-going animal studies at KARD scientific were sufficient to perform preliminary evaluations of effectiveness and safety of our drug candidates against a number of diseases.\nIn May 2013, we retained Cot\u00e9 Orphan Consulting (COC), headed by Dr. Tim Cot\u00e9, to help us with identifying orphan drug indications in our portfolio and to perform the regulatory agency submissions needed for obtaining orphan drug designations for those drugs.\nIn April 2014, we finalized a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with Public Health England (PHE), UK the British government's equivalent of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. This agreement allows for animal efficacy evaluation of various nanoviricides drug candidates against viruses of mutual interest at the BSL2, BSL3 or BSL4 facilities at PHE-UK as the case may be. Previously, we had signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement with PHE in July 2013. The MSA allows the scientists at Public Health England to develop a specific proposal for the testing of different nanoviricides, such as FluCide\u2122, against viruses of mutual interest\u201d to both organizations.\nIn May 2014, we executed a Master Services Agreement with Integrated Biotherapeutics, Inc. ( IBT\u201d), Gaithersburg, MD, a provider of pre-clinical anti-viral evaluation services. We intend to perform certain influenza drug candidate studies at IBT.\nSignificant Alliances and Related Parties\nTheraCour Pharma, Inc.\nPursuant to an Exclusive License Agreement we entered into with TheraCour Pharma, Inc., (TheraCour), the Company was granted exclusive licenses in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the virus types: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS), Influenza including Asian Bird Flu Virus, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), and Rabies. The Company has entered into an Additional License Agreement with TheraCour granting the Company the exclusive licenses in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the additional virus types for Dengue viruses, Japanese Encephalitis virus, West Nile Virus, Viruses causing viral Conjunctivitis (a disease of the eye) and Ocular Herpes, and Ebola/Marburg viruses.\nIn consideration for obtaining these exclusive licenses, we agreed: (1) that TheraCour can charge its costs (direct and indirect) plus no more than 30% of certain direct costs as a Development Fee and such development fees shall be due and payable in periodic installments as billed; (2) to pay $25,000 per month for usage of lab supplies and chemicals from existing stock held by TheraCour; (3) we will pay $2,000 or actual costs monthly, whichever is higher, for other general and administrative expenses incurred by TheraCour on our behalf; (4) make royalty payments (calculated as a percentage of net sales of the licensed drugs) of 15% to TheraCour Pharma, Inc.; (5) TheraCour Pharma, Inc. retains the exclusive right to develop and manufacture the licensed drugs. TheraCour Pharma, Inc. will manufacture the licensed drugs exclusively for NanoViricides, and unless such license is terminated, will not manufacture such product for its own sake or for others; and (6) TheraCour may request and NanoViricides, Inc. will pay an advance payment (refundable) equal to twice the amount of the previous months invoice to be applied as a prepayment towards expenses. TheraCour may terminate the license upon a material breach by us as specified in the agreement. However, we may avoid such termination if within 90 days of receipt of such termination notice we cure the breach.\nDevelopment costs charged by TheraCour Pharma, Inc. for the year ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $3,731,498, $2,403,126 and $2,611,754 respectively. At June 30, 2016, open accounts payable of $767,454 is due TheraCour.\nNo royalties are due TheraCour from the Company's inception through June 30, 2016.\nTheraCourPharma, Inc., is affiliated with the Company through the common control of it and our Company by Anil Diwan, President, who is a director of each corporation, and owns approximately 70% of the capital stock of TheraCourPharma, Inc., which itself owns approximately 15.7 % of the Common Stock of the Company.\nTheraCourPharma, Inc. owns 9,619,170 shares of the Company's outstanding Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock at June 30, 2016.\n 56 \nThe Company's Drug Pipeline\n 57 \nManagement has significantly reprioritized its drug development programs with a view to bring its first drug candidate into human clinical trials as soon as possible. Table 2 lists the current drug development programs, targeted viruses, specific indications, current development stage, and priority levels.\nThe Company currently has drug candidates for eight different indications in various stages of development towards IND-filings. Of these, we believe that the Skin Cream against VZV and the Skin Cream against Herpes Labialis (or Recurrent Herpes Labialis, RHL) present the most rapid opportunities for maturing into clinical trials. We believe that the FluCide drug candidates will follow later because of the significant development work that needs to be performed in pre-clinical studies against a number of different influenza virus strains and subtypes.\nManagement's beliefs are based on results of pre-clinical cell culture studies and in vivo animal studies using small animals such as various types of specially engineered mice and rabbits, as appropriate.\nThe Company has not yet performed detailed safety profile studies to be included in a Tox Package\u201d for submission to the FDA for any of our drug candidates. Our studies regarding safety of the various nanoviricide drug candidates to date have been preliminary and of a limited nature.\nHerpeCide - We are currently optimizing the anti-HSV ligands in animal studies for different disease indications. We believe we will be able to successfully advance the optimized drug candidates into an IND and human clinical trials. We are developing anti-herpesvirus drugs against four different indications at present, namely, (1) skin cream for topical treatment of shingles (VZV), (2) skin cream for herpes labialis and recurrent herpes labialis (RHL) (HSV-1), (3) Eye drops for Herpes Keratitis treatment, and (4) skin cream for genital herpes (HSV-2) treatment.\nNanoviricide Eye Drops - We previously undertook a new project and have already designed a ligand, made a nanoviricide drug, and completed successful animal studies that indicate significant preliminary efficacy and safety of a drug candidate against the severe pink eye disease caused by adenoviruses called epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis. We have expanded the indication to include HSV, another cause of viral eye diseases. We designed new broad-spectrum ligands expected to be active against all HSV types and strains, as well as retaining the previously observed activity features against adenoviruses and created new nanoviricide drug candidates. We have already tested these against HSV in cell cultures. Animal model studies against Herpes Keratitis are anticipated after we improve the anti-HSV activity of the drug candidates.\nFluCide. Injectable and Oral forms of the broad-spectrum anti-influenza drug candidate are currently in preclinical studies against all common influenzas as well as avian influenza H5N1. It is based on ligands that we have developed through rational drug design. These ligands are based on a well-known mechanism by which influenza viruses bind to cells. One mechanism involves the hemagglutinin coat protein of influenza virus binding to sialic acids on cell surfaces. Our broad-spectrum ligand used in FluCide is based on the sialic acid expressed by cells. Therefore, it is expected to work well against all of the influenza viruses. Since all influenza viruses, no matter what type (A, B, C), which subtype (e.g. HxNy of Influenza A), or clades, or strains, must bind to one of two varieties of sialic acid, we have designed the ligand such that all of the influenza viruses may bind to our ligand. If an influenza virus escapes FluCide, this mutant virus would be unable to bind to both types of sialic acids, and would be thus unable to infect most animal species, including birds and mammals. We are currently developing an Injectable FluCide drug for hospitalized patients, and an Oral FluCide drug for the rest of the patients.\nDengueCide - We obtained an orphan drug designation from the US FDA for our lead drug candidate in this program. We now plan on engaging into full pre-clinical development program for this drug candidate.\nHIVCide is our first announced drug project against HIV-I. Our first HIV drug to be developed is a targeted nanoviricide against HIV and is engineered with specific recognition ligands that allow multiple-point binding to inactivate HIV virus in the bloodstream.\nThe Company thus has a strong and growing drug pipeline to take us several years into the future. The Company already has technologies in development that promise to yield even better drugs against various diseases as the drugs we are developing now approach their product end of lifecycle. In particular, we are working on long term research projects for the purpose of eliminating persistent viruses thus providing true cures for many intractable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Herpes, Shingles, Epstein-Barr Virus, among others.\n 58 \nIt should be noted that all of our studies to date were preliminary. Thus, the evidence we have developed is indicative, but not considered confirmative, of the capabilities of the nanoviricides technology's potential. With the success of these preliminary studies, the Company has decided to perform further pre-clinical studies that validate safety and efficacy of its materials and its various anti-viral drugs. Management intends to use capital and debt financing to enable the completion of these goals.\nDrug Development Plan\nThe Company intends to perform the regulatory filings and own all the regulatory licenses for the drugs it is currently developing. The Company will develop these drugs in part via subcontracts to TheraCour Pharma, Inc. ( TheraCour\u201d), the exclusive source for these nanomaterials. With sourcing of materials from TheraCour, the Company prefers to manufacture these drugs in our own facility. However, the Company may manufacture these drugs under subcontract arrangements with external manufacturers that carry the appropriate regulatory licenses and have appropriate capabilities. The Company intends to distribute these drugs via subcontracts with distributor companies or in partnership arrangements. The Company plans to market these drugs either on its own or in conjunction with marketing partners. The Company also plans to actively pursue co-development, as well as other licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies. Such agreements may entail up-front payments, milestone payments, royalties, and/or cost sharing, profit sharing and many other instruments that may bring early revenues to the Company. Such licensing and/or co-development agreements may shape the manufacturing and development options that the Company may pursue. The Company has received significant interest from certain pharmaceutical companies for potential licensing or co-development of some of our drug candidates. However, none of these distributor or co-development agreements is in place at the current time.\nManufacturing\nManufacturing of Research Materials\nNanomaterials that form the basis of our nanoviricide drugs are produced for research by TheraCour Pharma, Inc. at our facilities in Shelton, Connecticut, under our licensing agreement with TheraCour.\nManufacturing of Drugs\nThe Company intends to manufacture Injectable and Oral FluCide, HIVCide, Nanoviricide Eye Drops, HerpeCide, DengueCide, RabiCide as well as other drugs for pre-clinical animal studies and human clinical studies, in facilities owned by the Company. Our cGMP-capable manufacturing facility in Shelton, CT has sufficient capacity for supply of the pre-clinical and clinical batches needed for all of our drug candidates as and when they are anticipated to be needed. The Company may go to a cGMP third party provider for the final fill-and-finish of the clinical drug products.\nFor our future commercial products, we will need to develop additional manufacturing capabilities and establish additional third party suppliers to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates to undertake clinical trials and to manufacture sufficient quantities of any products that are approved for commercial sale. If we are unable to develop manufacturing capabilities internally or contract for large scale manufacturing with third parties on acceptable terms for our future antiviral products, our ability to conduct large-scale clinical trials and meet customer demand for commercial products would be adversely affected.\nWe believe that the technology we use to manufacture our products and compounds is proprietary. For our products, we may have to disclose all necessary aspects of this technology to contract manufacturers to enable them to manufacture the products and compounds for us. We plan to have discussions with manufacturers under non-disclosure and non-compete agreements that are intended to restrict them from using or revealing this technology, but we cannot be certain that these manufacturers will comply with these restrictions. In addition, these manufacturers could develop their own technology related to the work they perform for us that we may need to manufacture our products or compounds. We could be required to enter into an agreement with that manufacturer if we wanted to use that technology ourselves or allow another manufacturer to use that technology. The manufacturer could refuse to allow us to use their technology or could demand terms to use their technology that are not acceptable.\n 59 \nWe believe that we are in compliance with all material environmental regulations related to the manufacture of our products.\nCompetition\nOur products in development target a number of diseases and conditions that include several different kinds of viral infections. There are many commercially available products for these diseases and a large number of companies and institutions are spending considerable amounts of money and other resources to develop additional products to treat these diseases. Most of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. If we are able to successfully develop products, they would compete with existing products based primarily on:\n\nThe current approved drugs for influenza include the neuraminidase inhibitors Tamiflu, Relenza, and Peramivir, anti-influenza drugs that are sold by Roche, Glaxo SmithKline (GSK), and BioCryst partners, respectively. In addition, M2 channel inhibitors, generic drugs include amantadine and rimantadine, both oral tablets that only inhibit the replication of the influenza A virus. There is significant viral resistance to the approved M2 channel inhibitors especially in the US. Several companies are developing anti-influenza drugs at present. Small chemical classes include neuraminidase inhibitors, M2-channel inhibitors, and RDRP inhibitors, among others. There are also monoclonal, polyclonal, and mixed antibodies, as well as enzymes as drugs in development.\nThere are a growing number of anti-HIV drugs being sold or in advanced stages of clinical development. Companies with HCV and HIV products include Gilead, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), in addition to several other pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms.\nThere are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of viral diseases of the external eye. A drug in development, called CTC-96, was shown to have little clinical benefit in published animal studies. Another drug in development, an Aganocide(tm) compound from NovaBay Pharma in collaboration with Alcon went through Phase II clinical studies. Alcon (a division of Novartis) discontinued further development of this drug following mixed results in a Phase II clinical trial. NovaBay regained the rights to it and continued further development. Aganocides, by virtue of their chemical structure, are generally not expected to be useful for any applications other than topical.\nThere are several drugs in the market that effectively control HSV cold sores and genital herpes lesions in most patients. These include the nucleoside analogues idoxuridine, vidarabine, acyclovir, famciclovir, and derivatives. However, their efficacy is limited or toxicities are high. Brincidofovir, based on the toxic drug cidofovir, is in development by Chimerix, but certain clinical trials involving brincidofovir have failed to meet the desired end points.\n 60 \nCurrently there are two accepted methods of rabies prophylaxis: rabies vaccines and rabies immune globulin, manufactured by many foreign and multinational manufacturers including Aventis Pasteur and Chiron (acquired by Novartis). These accepted methods will be the standard against which our new anti-rabies drug in development will be judged.\nIn order to compete successfully, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for therapeutic markets. Our products, even if successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d). The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these regulations, product development and the product approval process is very expensive and time consuming.\nThe FDA must license\u201d a drug before it can be sold in the United States. As of the date of this filing, the FDA has approved other nano-particulate drugs including Emend\u00ae by Merck and Rapamune\u00ae by Wyeth, as well as others. The general process for FDA approval is as follows:\nPreclinical Testing\nBefore we can test a drug candidate in humans, we must study the drug in laboratory experiments and in animals to generate data to support the drug's potential safety and benefits. We submit this data to the FDA in an investigational new drug application IND seeking their approval to test the compound in humans.\nClinical Trials\nIf the FDA accepts the investigational new drug application, we study the drug in human clinical trials to determine if the drug is safe and effective. These clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years to compile and are very expensive. These three phases, which are themselves subject to considerable regulation, are as follows:\n \u00b7 Phase I. The drug is given to a small number of healthy human subjects or patients to test for safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, distribution and excretion. \n \u00b7 Phase II. The drug is given to a limited patient population to determine the effect of the drug in treating the disease, the best dose of the drug, and the possible side effects and safety risks of the drug. \n \u00b7 Phase III. If a compound appears to be effective and safe in Phase II clinical trials, Phase III clinical trials are commenced to confirm those results. Phase III clinical trials are long-term, involve a significantly larger population, are conducted at numerous sites in different geographic regions and are carefully designed to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and benefits of a drug. It is not uncommon for a drug that appears promising in Phase II clinical trials to fail in the more rigorous and reliable Phase III clinical trials. \nFDA Approval Process\nIf we believe that the data from the Phase 3 clinical trials show an adequate level of safety and effectiveness, we will file a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA seeking approval to sell the drug for a particular use. The FDA will review the NDA and often will hold a public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisors asks additional questions regarding the drug. This committee makes a recommendation to the FDA that is not binding on the FDA but is generally followed. If the FDA agrees that the compound has met the required level of safety and effectiveness for a particular use, it will allow us to sell the drug in the United States for that use. It is not unusual, however, for the FDA to reject an application because it believes that the drug is not safe enough or effective enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted is reliable or conclusive.\n 61 \nAt any point in this process, the development of a drug could be stopped for a number of reasons including safety concerns and lack of treatment benefit. We cannot be certain that any clinical trials that we are currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future, will be completed successfully or within any specified time period. We may choose, or the FDA may require us, to delay or suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate does not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit.\nThe FDA may also require us to complete additional testing, provide additional data or information, improve our manufacturing processes, procedures or facilities or may require extensive post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or benefits of our product candidates if it determines that our new drug application does not contain adequate evidence of the safety and benefits of the drug. In addition, even if the FDA approves a drug, it could limit the uses of the drug. The FDA can withdraw approvals if it does not believe that we are complying with regulatory standards or if problems are uncovered or occur after approval.\nIn addition to obtaining FDA approval for each drug, we obtain FDA approval of the manufacturing facilities for any drug we sell, including those of companies who manufacture our drugs for us as well as our own and these facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA must also approve foreign establishments that manufacture products to be sold in the United States and these facilities are subject to periodic regulatory inspection.\nWe are also subject to other federal, state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. We use hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses and various radioactive compounds in our research and development activities and cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Any misuse or accidents involving these materials could lead to significant litigation, fines and penalties.\nDrugs are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the United States. In the European Union, there is a centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of a product in all countries in the European Union (which includes most major countries in Europe). If this procedure is not used, under a decentralized system, an approval in one country of the European Union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the European Union under a simplified application process at present. After approval under the centralized procedure, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries. These procedures are undergoing revision and modification at present. We have never received approval for a product in the European Union to date.\n 62 \nTime Schedules, Milestones and Development Costs\nIn the event that funding can be achieved, we shall endeavor to achieve completion of the following events within the next twelve months:\nThe status of each of our major research and development projects is as follows:\nTable 4: Drug Development Status\n Project 1 Injectable FluCide\u2122 against All Influenzas for Hospitalized Patients Current status We have declared a clinical candidate for influenza, NV-INF-1. This single drug is expected to be effective against most if not all influenza viruses. It is expected to be highly effective against all Influenza A viruses including bird flu H5N1 all clades, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenzas of all types, subtypes and strains, seasonal Influenzas, H7N9, H3N2, as well as 2009/H1N1 epidemic virus. We are now engaging into advanced pre-clinical drug development, or IND-enabling studies. We are currently performing synthesis scale up studies and the studies required for the Chemistry, Manufacture and Controls section of an IND application. We have performed initial safety/toxicology studies in small animals- mice and rats - intended at helping with the design of the full Safety and Toxicology studies ( Tox Package\u201d). We have prepared and used a first batch of materials for initial tox package studies. We intend to perform full Tox Package Studies when sufficient quantities become available. We also plan to perform additional animal studies as well as cell culture studies for efficacy of this drug candidate against a limited, unrelated influenza virus subtypes and strains. These studies are required for developing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the US FDA. Nature, timing and estimated costs The Company had budgeted approximately $1,500,000 for the material development, production and testing of this drug in 2012 and 2013, an additional $2M in 2014, and spent approximately $1.6M in 2015 on this project. These costs were paid from our available cash balances. Management has determined the results to be satisfactory. We now need to perform material characterization, pharmaco-kinetic, pharmaco-dynamic and toxicology studies, as well as extensive pre-clinical efficacy studies in both cell cultures and in animal models against a large number of different subtypes of Influenza viruses. We have presently budgeted this work plan at $2,500,000. If we are successful with the IND, we could begin Phase I and Phase II human clinical trials. We have estimated costs of approximately $5,000,000 for the initial human clinical trials and associated expenses of this drug candidate. The Company has sufficient cash in hand to cover the costs associated with the aforesaid studies and the initial human clinical trials. Anticipated completion date Preclinical stage workload remaining is approximately 12-18 months. However, because of the complexities of FluCide development including number of Influenza virus strains, etc., the project speed is limited by our available third party collaborations. We have now signed a collaborative agreement with the Webster Lab at the St. Jude Children's Hospital in Memphis, TN for this purpose. The Company anticipates filing an IND application after completion of the preclinical IND-enabling studies. Phase I drug testing to begin after the IND filing, and requires availability of cGMP-like manufactured product. The cGMP production capability is expected to be achieved in 9 to 12 months after we begin scale up production in the new facility. This project has priority level C, behind the Topical HerpeCide projects. Timing of commencement of expected material net cash inflows If we complete our preclinical studies in the next 12~18 months, and also are able to produce clinical batches at the end of this period, we can expect Phase I and Phase II human clinical trials to be completed at the earliest by 2018-2019. However, we have assigned a lower priority to this project, and this may cause reduced personnel, time, and budget allocation that could cause delays. Revenues may occur as a result of licensing the drug to another pharmaceutical partner at this stage. After Phase III clinical trials completion, revenues are expected to occur after FDA approval and marketing of the drug. Revenues may occur earlier if Flucide is approved for use in other countries or if the BARDA authority determines that FluCide should be stockpiled in the USG CDC stockpile of drugs for defense against pandemic influenza. If we are successful in partnering the drug with another pharmaceutical Company, we may see revenues much earlier than FDA approval. \n 63 \n The potential market for Injectable FluCide may be in the range of $300M to $3B, depending upon market penetration and other conditions. Our current manufacturing capability at the Shelton plant may be estimated to be capable of supplying approximately $50M-$200M of the demand at full-scale operation, depending upon the cost of the drug and the dose required. This production scale is believed to be sufficient for initial market entry and is expected to be able to produce revenues that can fuel a larger manufacturing capacity needed for this drug product. However, the Company intends to license commercial manufacture of this drug to a commercial partner. \n Project 2 Oral FluCide\u2122 against All Influenzas for Out-Patients Current status We have developed a highly effective anti-influenza drug candidate that is active when given orally. We believe that we will be able to optimize this drug candidate and declare a clinical candidate with a limited amount of structure-activity-relationship (SAR) efficacy studies. This single drug is expected to be effective against most if not all influenza viruses. It is expected to be highly effective against all Influenza A viruses including bird flu H5N1 all clades, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenzas of all types, subtypes and strains, seasonal Influenzas, H7N9, H3N2, as well as 2009/H1N1 epidemic virus. We are now engaging into advanced pre-clinical drug development, or IND-enabling studies. After completing the SAR studies, we will need to perform synthesis scale up studies and the studies required for the Chemistry, Manufacture and Controls section of an IND application. We believe that these studies will benefit from the studies already performed for the injectable FluCide version, as both the oral and injectable drug candidates employ the same virus-binding ligand. We intend to perform Safety and Toxicology studies ( Tox Package\u201d) when sufficient quantities become available. We also plan to perform additional animal studies as well as cell culture studies for efficacy of this drug candidate", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein and in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. Readers should carefully review the risk factors disclosed in this Form 10-K and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC.\nAs used in this report, the terms Company\u201d, we\u201d, our\u201d, us\u201d and NNVC\u201d refer to Nanoviricides, Inc., a Nevada corporation.\nPRELIMINARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which we indicate by words or phrases such as anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d will,\u201d we believe,\u201d NNVC believes,\u201d management believes\u201d and similar language. The forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of NNVC and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those set forth in the discussion under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this report. Actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. We base the forward-looking statements on information currently available to us, and we assume no obligation to update them.\nInvestors are also advised to refer to the information in our previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), especially on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, in which we discuss in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. As such, investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks and uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions.\nManagement's Plan of Operation\nThe Company's drug development business model was formed in May 2005 with a license to the patents and intellectual property held by TheraCour Pharma, Inc., that enabled creation of drugs engineered specifically to combat viral diseases in humans. This exclusive license from TheraCour Pharma serves as a foundation for our intellectual property. The Company was granted a worldwide exclusive perpetual license to this technology for several drugs with specific targeting mechanisms in perpetuity for the treatment of the following human viral diseases: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Rabies, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Influenza and Asian Bird Flu Virus. The Company has entered into an Additional License Agreement with TheraCour granting the Company the exclusive licenses in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the additional virus types for Dengue viruses, Japanese Encephalitis virus, West Nile Virus, Viruses causing viral Conjunctivitis (a disease of the eye) and Ocular Herpes, and Ebola/Marburg viruses. The Company may want to add further virus types to its drug pipeline. The Company would then need to negotiate with TheraCour an amendment to the Licensing Agreement to include those of such additional viruses that the Company determines it wants to follow for further development. We are seeking to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery pre-clinical development programs and through an in-licensing strategy.\n 48 \nThe Company plans to develop several drugs through the preclinical studies and clinical trial phases with the goal of eventually obtaining approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) and International regulatory agencies for these drugs. The Company plans, when appropriate, to seek regulatory approvals in several international markets, including developed markets such as Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Emerging Regions such as Southeast Asia, India, China, Central and South America, as well as the African subcontinent. The seeking of these regulatory approvals would only come when and if one or more of our drugs, now in early stage of pre-clinical development, has significantly advanced through the US FDA and international regulatory process. If and as these advances occur, the Company may attempt to partner with more established pharmaceutical companies to advance the various drugs through the approval process.\nThe Company intends to perform the regulatory filings and own all the regulatory licenses for the drugs it is currently developing. The Company will develop these drugs in part via subcontracts to TheraCour Pharma, Inc., the exclusive source for these nanomaterials. The Company may manufacture these drugs itself, or under subcontract arrangements with external manufacturers that carry the appropriate regulatory licenses and have appropriate capabilities. The Company intends to distribute these drugs via subcontracts with distributor companies or in partnership arrangements. The Company plans to market these drugs either on its own or in conjunction with marketing partners. The Company also plans to actively pursue co-development, as well as other licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies. Such agreements may entail up-front payments, milestone payments, royalties, and/or cost sharing, profit sharing and many other instruments that may bring early revenues to the Company. Such licensing and/or co-development agreements may shape the manufacturing and development options that the Company may pursue. The Company has received significant interest from certain pharmaceutical companies for potential licensing or co-development of some of our drug candidates. However, none of these distributor or co-development agreements is in place at the current time.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to develop effective nanoviricides, or if developed, that we will have sufficient resources to be able to successfully manufacture and market these products to commence revenue-generating operations.\nThere can be no assurance that other developments in the field would not impact our business plan adversely. For example, successful creation and availability of an effective vaccine may reduce the potential market size for a particular viral disease.\nOur goal, which we can give no assurance that we will achieve, is for NanoViricides, Inc. to become the premier company developing highly safe and effective drugs that employ an integrated multiplicity of actions as enabled by our nanomedicine approach for anti-viral therapy.\nTo date, we have engaged in organizational activities; developing and sourcing compounds and preparing nano-materials; and experimentation involving preclinical studies using cell cultures and animals. We have generated funding through the issuances of debt and the sales of securities under our shelf registration and the private placement of common stock (See, Item 5). The Company does not currently have any long term debt, other than Series B Convertible Debentures of $6M and the Series C Convertible Debentures of $5M presented in the Financial Statements and more fully described herein. We have not generated any revenues and we do not expect to generate revenues in the near future. We may not be successful in developing our drugs and start selling our products when planned, or we may not become profitable in the future. We have incurred net losses in each fiscal period since inception of our operations.\n 49 \nOur Collaborations and Service Contract Agreements\nOur development model is to employ collaborations and service contract relationships with renowned academic labs, government labs, as well as service contracts with external service providers in order to minimize our capital requirements.\nAll of our agreements provide for the evaluation of Nanoviricides\u00ae substances created and provided by the Company to the Laboratory (or Collaborator). In general, the Laboratory is compensated for certain material and personnel costs for these evaluations. The evaluations involve in vitro and in vivo scientific studies at the Laboratory using their established protocols. In some cases, the Company provides scientific input regarding certain modifications to their protocols as may be needed. The Laboratory returns the results and data to the Company. The Laboratory is allowed to publish the results after allowing time for the Company to protect intellectual property (IP) as needed. The Company sends nanoviricides as well as positive control (i.e. known therapeutics) and negative control (i.e. known not to work) compounds as needed in a fully formulated, ready to use form, to the Laboratory. All IP related to the nanoviricide materials, their formulations and reformulations, and their usage, rests with the Company. Any IP developed by the Laboratory regarding their own know-how, such as laboratory tests, their modifications, etc. rests with the Laboratory. Joint inventions are treated as per applicable US Laws.\nThe Company tries to choose the scientific laboratories with the most appropriate facilities and know-how relating to a particular field for the evaluation of an antiviral agent developed by the Company. The Company also tries to work with more than one laboratory for the evaluation of an antiviral agent developed by the Company. The Company also tries to work with more than one laboratory for a given group of viruses whenever possible. We seek to improve confidence by obtaining independent datasets for corroboration of the efficacy and safety of the nanoviricides we develop. In addition, the Company is not dependent on a particular Laboratory for the development of any specific drug candidate in our product pipeline.\nTo date, the Company has engaged in non-GLP Efficacy and Safety evaluations in both in vitro (cell culture models) and in vivo (animal models) of our different Nanoviricides\u00ae at different laboratories.\nOur current relationships include:\nFor Herpes Virus Infections, and for Viral Diseases of the Eye (Adenoviruses, Herpesviruses - Epidemic Kerato-conjunctivitis (EKC), Herpes Keratitis):\n 1.

Public Health England, UK. \n 50 \nIn addition, we have signed an agreement with the Biologics Consulting Group (BCG), Alexandria, Virginia, to help us with the US FDA applications processes, and with the development of applications as well as drug development programs, as needed. We have also signed an agreement with Australian Biologics Pty, Ltd. to help us with the regulatory processes in Australia.\nWe have also signed a Master Services Agreement with BASi to perform cGLP and GLP-like safety and toxicological studies that are necessary for filing an IND for each of our drugs.\nIn April 2014, we finalized a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with Public Health England (PHE), UK, the British government's equivalent of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, This agreement allows for animal efficacy evaluation of various nanoviricides drug candidates against viruses of mutual interest at the BSL2, BSL3 or BSL4 facilities at PHE-UK as the case may be.\nWe have also recently signed a Master Services Agreement with Integrated Biotherapeutics, Inc. ( IBT\u201d), Gaithersburg, MD, a provider of pre-clinical anti-viral evaluation services. We intend to perform certain influenza drug candidate studies at IBT.\nWe have additional collaborations in the process of formalization. We have also signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement with the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM.\nWe typically employ more than one external laboratory to perform testing for a particular disease agent in order to limit possible laboratory level bias. We previously had a collaborative research agreement with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Dr. Putnak Lab, for work on dengue viruses. This agreement has since lapsed, but we believe it can be reactivated at an opportune time.\nTo date, we have entered into the following collaborations.\nHSV-1 and HSV-2 Nanoviricides Efficacy Evaluation Agreement with the Collaborative Ophthalmic Research Laboratories (CORL) at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI.\nIn January 2016, we signed an agreement with CORL. Under this agreement, CORL will perform evaluation of efficacy of our nanoviricides drug candidates in cell culture assays as well as in small animal studies towards the goal of filing an IND application for ocular Herpes Keratitis, and possibly for recurrent Herpes Labialis (RHL, cold sores\u201d). The studies will be performed in the laboratory of Dr. Curtis Brandt, an expert in herpes simplex virus infections and in evaluating anti-viral agents.\nEvaluation of Nanoviricides Efficacy Against Ocular Viral Infections; Agreement with the Campbell Lab at the University of Pittsburgh, PA\nIn January 2016, we signed an agreement with the Campbell Lab. Under this Agreement, the Campbell Lab will perform evaluation of efficacy of our nanoviricides drug candidates in cell culture assays against various strains of HSV-1, HSV-2, and Adenoviruses. Successful candidates will be further evaluated for efficacy in industry standard ocular animal models for Herpes Keratitis as well as Adenoviral Epidemic KeratoConjunctivitis (EKC), towards the goal of filing IND application(s) for ocular Herpes Keratitis, and for EKC. The research will be performed in the Charles T. Campbell Ophthalmic Microbiology Laboratory by Dr. Eric Romanowski, Research Director. Dr. Romanowski has extensive experience in ocular virus infections and anti-viral agents discovery.\nAgreement with the Department of Ophthalmology, Baylor University College of Medicine, Houston, TX\nIn February 2016, we signed an agreement with the Pflugfelder Lab at Baylor. Under this Agreement, the Lab will perform confirmatory testing of certain nanoviricides for efficacy in a small animal model of Herpes Keratitis. The research will be supervised by Dr. Stephen Pflugfelder, Professor of Ophthalmology and the James and Margaret Elkins Chair in Ophthalmology at Baylor. Dr. Pflugfelder has extensive experience in ophthalmological research as well as in ocular drug development, including conducting clinical trials. The research will be performed in the laboratories of the Department of Ophthalmology. This program is currently on hold until appropriate personnel are hired at the Lab.\n 51 \nResearch and Development Agreement with Professor Ken Rosenthal's laboratory at the Northeastern Ohio Medical University (NEOMED, formerly called NEOUCOM)\nOn May 13, 2010, the Company announced that it had signed a research and development agreement with Professor Ken Rosenthal's laboratory at the Northeastern Ohio Medical University (NEOMED). Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Professor Rosenthal and NEOMED will evaluate the effectiveness of nanoviricides drug candidates against Herpes Simplex Viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2, in both cell culture and animal models. The focus of this evaluation will be the development of drug candidates against herpes skin infections (oral and genital herpes). Dr. Ken Rosenthal is a professor of microbiology, immunology and biochemistry at NEOMED. He is a leading researcher in the field of herpes viruses. His laboratory has developed an improved mouse model of skin-infection with HSV to follow the disease progression. This model has been shown to provide highly uniform and reproducible results. A uniform disease pattern including onset of lesions and further progression to zosteriform lesions is observed in all animals in this model. This uniformity makes it an ideal model for comparative testing of various drug candidates which, the Company believes, can be expected to lead to a broad-spectrum anti-HSV antiviral treatment capable of attacking both HSV-1 and HSV-2.\nOn August 16, 2010, the Company reported that its anti-Herpes drug candidates demonstrated significant efficacy in the recently completed cell culture studies in Dr. Rosenthal Lab at NEOMED. Several of the anti-Herpes nanoviricides\u00ae demonstrated a dose-dependent maximal inhibition of Herpes virus infectivity in a cell culture model. Almost complete inhibition of the virus production was observed at clinically usable concentrations. These studies employed the H129 strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). H129 is an encephalitic strain that closely resembles a clinical isolate; it is known to be more virulent than classic HSV-1 laboratory strains. The H129 strain will be used in subsequent animal testing of nanoviricides. Since then the Company was optimizing formulations for use in the dermal HSV-1 H129c infection animal model in the Rosenthal lab. The Company also continued to further optimize the anti-herpes nanoviricides. Our herpes program was run at a lower priority than other programs until recently. In April 2015, after only 4 cycles of SAR (Structure-Activity-Relationship based improvements), our anti-herpes nanoviricides demonstrated strong effectiveness in the lethal HSV-1 H129c dermal infection model in the Rosenthal Lab at NEOMED. Treatment with certain nanoviricides caused significant improvements in the clinical observations, and led to >85% survival of the infected animals, wherein 100% of the untreated animals died within 10 days. In August 2015, the Company reported that these results were reproduced in dermal animal model at Transpharm, with 100% of the nanoviricides treated animals surviving.\nThe HerpeCide program has thus advanced to the lead identification stage now. We are now working on this program with a high priority, in parallel with our Injectable FluCide program.\nProfessor Rosenthal retired in December 2014, continued his laboratory and our R&D through April 2015, and has closed the lab thereafter. He is now Professor at Roseman University of Health Sciences College of Medicine, NV. He continues as Professor Emeritus at Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED).\nPre-Clinical Services Agreement with TransPharm\nIn January 2015, we commenced a master pre-clinical studies agreement with Transpharm Preclinical Solutions ( TransPharm\u201d), a pre-clinical research services organization (CRO) in Jackson, MI. TransPharm has and will perform the topical dermal efficacy studies for our anti-HSV drug candidates. The agreement can also be extended to other indications for which TransPharm may already have an animal model or may be able to establish an animal model.\nRegulatory Consulting and Advisory Agreement with Biologics Consulting Group, VA (BCG).\nIn July 2011 we signed an agreement with Biologics Consulting Group to help us with our regulatory strategy and filings. Several of the members of the BCG faculty had experience working as part of the US FDA.\nBCG has helped us with the pre-IND filing for our anti-Influenza drug candidate, and for developing the herpesvirus treatment strategy.\nIn July 2012 we signed an agreement with Australian Biologics Pty Ltd to help us with our regulatory strategy and filings in Australia, and to help us with potentially developing clinical trials programs in Australia.\n 52 \nTechnical Testing Agreement, dated December 15, 2007, between The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research ( Feinstein\u201d) and NanoViricides, Inc.\nThe term of this agreement ran from December 17, 2007 through December 31, 2010. Feinstein performed animal studies testing services on epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis and related viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. All test results and inventions resulting from the tests remained property of the Company. Inventions resulting from the testing services would be determined by an independent patent counsel with the Company retaining a commercial license on such inventions. The Company paid Feinstein an amount equal to $40,090.19 for the costs associated with the research.\nThe first study of nanoviricide effectiveness against adenoviral EKC was completed at Feinstein in June, 2008. The study indicated that the best nanoviricide drug candidate showed excellent clearance of clinical signs of the disease, viz. redness of the eye as well as sticky exudates, in a short time after treatment.\nAnti-Influenza Drug Development Agreement with the Webster Lab at St Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN\nIn May 2016, we signed an agreement with the Webster Lab at St. Jude Children's Hospital. Under this Agreement, the Webster Lab will evaluate nanoviricide drug candidates in cell culture studies against a large number of Influenza viruses to optimize the efficacy and broad-spectrum for a clinical development candidate. Variations on the previously selected ligand in NV-INF-1 and NV-INF-2 will be performed if necessary.\nThe testing of these candidates for anti-influenza activity will be performed in the laboratory of Dr. Elena Govorkova in collaboration with Dr. Robert G. Webster and will include both in vitro and in vivo studies. They have extensive experience in influenza virus infections with a large number of different influenza strains, and in anti-viral agents discovery. The overall objective of these studies will be to help select clinical drug development candidates for the treatment of influenza virus in humans, using both the injectable and oral administration routes. Injectable administration is preferable for hospitalized patients that are extremely sick, while oral administration is preferred for out-patients.\nThe most optimal candidate will then be evaluated against a wide variety of Influenza viruses in small animal efficacy studies with a goal of obtaining data for an IND submission for Injectable FluCide drug candidate for severely ill hospitalized patients, and also for Oral FluCide drug candidate for out-patients with Influenza.\nSafety/Toxicology Studies Agreement with BASi\nIn September 2014, we signed an agreement with BASi. BASi is a pre-clinical contract services organization that specializes in cGLP and GLP-like safety and toxicological testing of drug candidates and preparation of the Tox Package\u201d section of an IND application. BASi performed a GLP-like preliminary safety and toxicology study in which there were no significant compound related adverse events found. Our safety and toxicology studies for FluCide are being conducted by BASi for submission with an IND application. BASi will also perform the safety toxicology studies for the anti-herpes nanoviricide drug candidates in our HerpeCide program.\nResearch and Development Agreement with the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley)\nOn February 16, 2010, the Company announced that it had signed a research and development agreement with Dr. Eva Harris's laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley). Under this agreement, Dr. Harris and coworkers will evaluate the effectiveness of nanoviricides\u00ae drug candidates against various dengue viruses. Cell culture models as well as in vivo animal studies will be employed for testing the drug candidates. Dr. Eva Harris is a Professor of Infectious Diseases at UC Berkeley. She is a leading researcher in the field of dengue. Her group has developed a unique animal model for dengue virus infection and disease that effectively emulates the pathology seen in humans. In particular, the critical problem of dengue virus infection, called Antibody-Dependent Enhancement\u201d (ADE), is reproduced in this animal model. When a person who was previously infected with one serotype of dengue virus is later infected by a different serotype, the antibodies produced by the immune system can lead to increased severity of the second dengue infection, instead of controlling it. ADE thus can lead to severe dengue disease or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). This agreement was extended in 2014.\n 53 \nMaster Services Agreement, dated August 31, 2009, by and between Southern Research Institute ( Southern\u201d) and NanoViricides, Inc.\nThe term of this agreement was three years from its execution. The Company agrees to supply necessary quantities of its products in order for Southern to complete specific studies as to the efficacy and safety of the Company's compounds. The Company shall pay charges associated with each task order and provide payment in the amount and as indicated therein. Under this agreement, Southern will estimate the work load and invoices for additional task orders, subject to the Company's agreement on costs.\nThe Company's anti-HIV drug testing in cell cultures is performed at the Southern Research Institute in Frederick, MD.\nCooperative Research and Development Agreement for Material Transfer, dated October 15, 2007, between NanoViricides, Inc. and United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease ( Laboratory\u201d).\nThe term of the agreement was for one year initially and extended for an additional year. It has been extended again, based on positive results. The Company shall invent, develop, and provide to the laboratory, Nanoviricides\u00ae that are expected to be capable of attacking a multiplicity of different Ebola and Marburg viruses. The Laboratory shall assess in vitro and in vivo activity of the anti-Ebola Nanoviricides\u00ae provided against the virus.\nPreliminary studies began in February 2008. Certain nanoviricides candidates were found to be highly successful against Ebola virus in pre-clinical cell culture studies. Ebola virus is known to produce, in vivo, a soluble decoy protein that is a portion of its surface glycoprotein. If the nanoviricides that were successful in the in vitro studies bind to the decoy protein portion of the Ebola virus envelope, then we would expect that the nanoviricides would be neutralized in vivo by the decoy protein. We are therefore developing novel ligands that would potentially bind to the Ebola virus glycoprotein portion that is known to be not a part of the decoy protein. The MTA was extended for another year in October, 2009 to continue these studies.\nCooperative Research and Development Agreement for Material Transfer, dated October, 2014, between NanoViricides, Inc. and United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease ( Laboratory\u201d).\nThe term of the agreement is for one year. The Company shall invent, develop, and provide to the laboratory, nanoviricides\u00ae that are expected to be capable of attacking a multiplicity of different Ebola and Marburg viruses. The Laboratory shall assess in vitro and in vivo activity of the anti-Ebola Nanoviricides\u00ae provided against the virus.\nThere is no payment by the Company to the Laboratory, nor from the Laboratory to the Company. USAMRIID has federal funding to support their part of the work.\nThe Company has lowered the priority of this program during the recent economic crisis in order to use our resources most effectively.\nClinical Study Agreement, dated May 6, 2009, between NanoViricides, Inc. and TheVac, LLC. ( Laboratory\u201d).\nOn May 6, 2009, the Company entered into a Clinical Study Agreement with THEVAC, LLC, a company affiliated with the Emerging Technology Center of the Louisiana State University. TheVac performed biological testing of certain anti-herpes nanoviricides. TheVac conducted studies on the effect of anti-herpes nanoviricide drug candidates against certain herpes simplex viruses in cell culture models. The studies indicated a >99.9% reduction in HSV-1 in cell culture assays by certain of our nanoviricide drug candidates. The Company paid the Laboratory the amount of $55,000 for the studies.\nMaterials Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between NanoViricides, Inc. and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe CRADA provided that the CDC would test the efficacy of the Company's drug candidates against rabies. The nanoviricides provided by the Company remained its proprietary information. The CDC retains rights to certain inventions that may be conceived during testing. The Company paid the CDC an amount equal to approximately $10,000 for the costs associated with the research.\n 54 \nOther Agreements and Contracts\nThe Company continues to receive or obtain and evaluate various research and drug development collaborations with a number of parties that include government institutions, academic labs, contract service organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and other potential business collaborators or partners in the normal course of business. We have also received requests for material for testing under Material Testing Agreements (MTAs) from certain agencies. However, there can be no assurance that a final agreement may be forthcoming.\nFurther, the Company has had preliminary negotiations and discussions with other pharma and non-pharma commercial enterprises regarding commercial projects based on the Company's technologies.\nWe have developed lead drug candidates against a number of viral diseases. Proof-of-principle efficacy studies in animals have been conducted successfully in many of these.\nKARD Scientific, LLC, Beverly, MA has performed several of the animal studies for evaluation of efficacy and of preliminary safety of our nanoviricides drug candidates against Influenza and HIV to date. KARD's contract services operations were closed down by its owner, Dr. Krishna Menon, due to personal reasons in 2014.\nPreviously, in December, 2005, the Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi (NIHE), a unit of the Vietnamese Government's Ministry of Health. This Memorandum of Understanding calls for cooperation in the development and testing of certain nanoviricides. The parties agreed that NanoViricides will retain all intellectual property rights with respect to any resulting product and that the initial target would be the development of drugs against H5N1 (avian influenza). NIHE thereafter requested that we develop a drug for rabies, a request to which we agreed. The initial phase of this agreement called first for laboratory testing, followed by animal testing of several drug candidates developed by the Company. Preliminary laboratory testing of our anti-Influenza drug candidates in the FluCide\u2122 program were successfully performed at the laboratories of the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi (NIHE), against both clade 1 and clade 2 of H5N1 virus isolated in Vietnam. Successful animal testing of RabiCide-ITM, the Company's rabies drug, was performed in Vietnam during the first half of 2007, and reproducibly repeated in 2008. Rabies testing can safely be done at their BSL2 facility. The H5N1 animal testing requires a BSL3 (biological safety laboratory level 3) laboratory. NIHE has acquired a BSL3 animal testing capacity during 2008.\nWe have finalized execution of a Materials Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (M-CRADA) with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA in July, 2008. This agreement was initiated based on our success against Rabies in the animal studies conducted at NIHE Vietnam. Preliminary animal studies against Rabies were expected to start in the last quarter of calendar year 2009 or first quarter of calendar year 2010. The Company has lowered the priority of this program during the recent economic crisis in order to use our resources most effectively. Subsequent to the agreement execution, the Company has supplied certain materials to CDC for testing. This testing, if successful, is expected to expand to involve potential use of nanoviricides as (1) a post- infection therapeutic drug against rabies, possibly in conjunction with a rabies vaccine, and (2) a post-exposure prophylactic drug against rabies, to replace costly human or monoclonal antibodies, possibly in conjunction with a rabies vaccine. To date, there is no effective post-infection therapeutic against rabies. Post-exposure prophylaxis market has been estimated to be as much $300M to $500M worldwide.\nWe finalized a CRADA with Walter Reed Army Institutes of Research (WRAIR) to develop collaboratively antiviral agents against all four types of dengue viruses in April, 2007. Preliminary work has commenced under this CRADA. This CRADA will need to be renegotiated due to changes in funding requirements at WRAIR. The Company has not renewed this agreement.\nOn May 17, 2010, the Company announced that it had signed a research and development agreement with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), for the testing of its anti-HIV drug candidates. Most recently, the Company's anti-HIV injectables animal testing was performed by KARD Scientific.\n 55 \nThe above collaborations, subcontract, or service contract agreements, and our on-going animal studies at KARD scientific were sufficient to perform preliminary evaluations of effectiveness and safety of our drug candidates against a number of diseases.\nIn May 2013, we retained Cot\u00e9 Orphan Consulting (COC), headed by Dr. Tim Cot\u00e9, to help us with identifying orphan drug indications in our portfolio and to perform the regulatory agency submissions needed for obtaining orphan drug designations for those drugs.\nIn April 2014, we finalized a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with Public Health England (PHE), UK the British government's equivalent of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. This agreement allows for animal efficacy evaluation of various nanoviricides drug candidates against viruses of mutual interest at the BSL2, BSL3 or BSL4 facilities at PHE-UK as the case may be. Previously, we had signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement with PHE in July 2013. The MSA allows the scientists at Public Health England to develop a specific proposal for the testing of different nanoviricides, such as FluCide\u2122, against viruses of mutual interest\u201d to both organizations.\nIn May 2014, we executed a Master Services Agreement with Integrated Biotherapeutics, Inc. ( IBT\u201d), Gaithersburg, MD, a provider of pre-clinical anti-viral evaluation services. We intend to perform certain influenza drug candidate studies at IBT.\nSignificant Alliances and Related Parties\nTheraCour Pharma, Inc.\nPursuant to an Exclusive License Agreement we entered into with TheraCour Pharma, Inc., (TheraCour), the Company was granted exclusive licenses in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the virus types: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS), Influenza including Asian Bird Flu Virus, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), and Rabies. The Company has entered into an Additional License Agreement with TheraCour granting the Company the exclusive licenses in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the additional virus types for Dengue viruses, Japanese Encephalitis virus, West Nile Virus, Viruses causing viral Conjunctivitis (a disease of the eye) and Ocular Herpes, and Ebola/Marburg viruses.\nIn consideration for obtaining these exclusive licenses, we agreed: (1) that TheraCour can charge its costs (direct and indirect) plus no more than 30% of certain direct costs as a Development Fee and such development fees shall be due and payable in periodic installments as billed; (2) to pay $25,000 per month for usage of lab supplies and chemicals from existing stock held by TheraCour; (3) we will pay $2,000 or actual costs monthly, whichever is higher, for other general and administrative expenses incurred by TheraCour on our behalf; (4) make royalty payments (calculated as a percentage of net sales of the licensed drugs) of 15% to TheraCour Pharma, Inc.; (5) TheraCour Pharma, Inc. retains the exclusive right to develop and manufacture the licensed drugs. TheraCour Pharma, Inc. will manufacture the licensed drugs exclusively for NanoViricides, and unless such license is terminated, will not manufacture such product for its own sake or for others; and (6) TheraCour may request and NanoViricides, Inc. will pay an advance payment (refundable) equal to twice the amount of the previous months invoice to be applied as a prepayment towards expenses. TheraCour may terminate the license upon a material breach by us as specified in the agreement. However, we may avoid such termination if within 90 days of receipt of such termination notice we cure the breach.\nDevelopment costs charged by TheraCour Pharma, Inc. for the year ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $3,731,498, $2,403,126 and $2,611,754 respectively. At June 30, 2016, open accounts payable of $767,454 is due TheraCour.\nNo royalties are due TheraCour from the Company's inception through June 30, 2016.\nTheraCourPharma, Inc., is affiliated with the Company through the common control of it and our Company by Anil Diwan, President, who is a director of each corporation, and owns approximately 70% of the capital stock of TheraCourPharma, Inc., which itself owns approximately 15.7 % of the Common Stock of the Company.\nTheraCourPharma, Inc. owns 9,619,170 shares of the Company's outstanding Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock at June 30, 2016.\n 56 \nThe Company's Drug Pipeline\n 57 \nManagement has significantly reprioritized its drug development programs with a view to bring its first drug candidate into human clinical trials as soon as possible. Table 2 lists the current drug development programs, targeted viruses, specific indications, current development stage, and priority levels.\nThe Company currently has drug candidates for eight different indications in various stages of development towards IND-filings. Of these, we believe that the Skin Cream against VZV and the Skin Cream against Herpes Labialis (or Recurrent Herpes Labialis, RHL) present the most rapid opportunities for maturing into clinical trials. We believe that the FluCide drug candidates will follow later because of the significant development work that needs to be performed in pre-clinical studies against a number of different influenza virus strains and subtypes.\nManagement's beliefs are based on results of pre-clinical cell culture studies and in vivo animal studies using small animals such as various types of specially engineered mice and rabbits, as appropriate.\nThe Company has not yet performed detailed safety profile studies to be included in a Tox Package\u201d for submission to the FDA for any of our drug candidates. Our studies regarding safety of the various nanoviricide drug candidates to date have been preliminary and of a limited nature.\nHerpeCide - We are currently optimizing the anti-HSV ligands in animal studies for different disease indications. We believe we will be able to successfully advance the optimized drug candidates into an IND and human clinical trials. We are developing anti-herpesvirus drugs against four different indications at present, namely, (1) skin cream for topical treatment of shingles (VZV), (2) skin cream for herpes labialis and recurrent herpes labialis (RHL) (HSV-1), (3) Eye drops for Herpes Keratitis treatment, and (4) skin cream for genital herpes (HSV-2) treatment.\nNanoviricide Eye Drops - We previously undertook a new project and have already designed a ligand, made a nanoviricide drug, and completed successful animal studies that indicate significant preliminary efficacy and safety of a drug candidate against the severe pink eye disease caused by adenoviruses called epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis. We have expanded the indication to include HSV, another cause of viral eye diseases. We designed new broad-spectrum ligands expected to be active against all HSV types and strains, as well as retaining the previously observed activity features against adenoviruses and created new nanoviricide drug candidates. We have already tested these against HSV in cell cultures. Animal model studies against Herpes Keratitis are anticipated after we improve the anti-HSV activity of the drug candidates.\nFluCide. Injectable and Oral forms of the broad-spectrum anti-influenza drug candidate are currently in preclinical studies against all common influenzas as well as avian influenza H5N1. It is based on ligands that we have developed through rational drug design. These ligands are based on a well-known mechanism by which influenza viruses bind to cells. One mechanism involves the hemagglutinin coat protein of influenza virus binding to sialic acids on cell surfaces. Our broad-spectrum ligand used in FluCide is based on the sialic acid expressed by cells. Therefore, it is expected to work well against all of the influenza viruses. Since all influenza viruses, no matter what type (A, B, C), which subtype (e.g. HxNy of Influenza A), or clades, or strains, must bind to one of two varieties of sialic acid, we have designed the ligand such that all of the influenza viruses may bind to our ligand. If an influenza virus escapes FluCide, this mutant virus would be unable to bind to both types of sialic acids, and would be thus unable to infect most animal species, including birds and mammals. We are currently developing an Injectable FluCide drug for hospitalized patients, and an Oral FluCide drug for the rest of the patients.\nDengueCide - We obtained an orphan drug designation from the US FDA for our lead drug candidate in this program. We now plan on engaging into full pre-clinical development program for this drug candidate.\nHIVCide is our first announced drug project against HIV-I. Our first HIV drug to be developed is a targeted nanoviricide against HIV and is engineered with specific recognition ligands that allow multiple-point binding to inactivate HIV virus in the bloodstream.\nThe Company thus has a strong and growing drug pipeline to take us several years into the future. The Company already has technologies in development that promise to yield even better drugs against various diseases as the drugs we are developing now approach their product end of lifecycle. In particular, we are working on long term research projects for the purpose of eliminating persistent viruses thus providing true cures for many intractable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Herpes, Shingles, Epstein-Barr Virus, among others.\n 58 \nIt should be noted that all of our studies to date were preliminary. Thus, the evidence we have developed is indicative, but not considered confirmative, of the capabilities of the nanoviricides technology's potential. With the success of these preliminary studies, the Company has decided to perform further pre-clinical studies that validate safety and efficacy of its materials and its various anti-viral drugs. Management intends to use capital and debt financing to enable the completion of these goals.\nDrug Development Plan\nThe Company intends to perform the regulatory filings and own all the regulatory licenses for the drugs it is currently developing. The Company will develop these drugs in part via subcontracts to TheraCour Pharma, Inc. ( TheraCour\u201d), the exclusive source for these nanomaterials. With sourcing of materials from TheraCour, the Company prefers to manufacture these drugs in our own facility. However, the Company may manufacture these drugs under subcontract arrangements with external manufacturers that carry the appropriate regulatory licenses and have appropriate capabilities. The Company intends to distribute these drugs via subcontracts with distributor companies or in partnership arrangements. The Company plans to market these drugs either on its own or in conjunction with marketing partners. The Company also plans to actively pursue co-development, as well as other licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies. Such agreements may entail up-front payments, milestone payments, royalties, and/or cost sharing, profit sharing and many other instruments that may bring early revenues to the Company. Such licensing and/or co-development agreements may shape the manufacturing and development options that the Company may pursue. The Company has received significant interest from certain pharmaceutical companies for potential licensing or co-development of some of our drug candidates. However, none of these distributor or co-development agreements is in place at the current time.\nManufacturing\nManufacturing of Research Materials\nNanomaterials that form the basis of our nanoviricide drugs are produced for research by TheraCour Pharma, Inc. at our facilities in Shelton, Connecticut, under our licensing agreement with TheraCour.\nManufacturing of Drugs\nThe Company intends to manufacture Injectable and Oral FluCide, HIVCide, Nanoviricide Eye Drops, HerpeCide, DengueCide, RabiCide as well as other drugs for pre-clinical animal studies and human clinical studies, in facilities owned by the Company. Our cGMP-capable manufacturing facility in Shelton, CT has sufficient capacity for supply of the pre-clinical and clinical batches needed for all of our drug candidates as and when they are anticipated to be needed. The Company may go to a cGMP third party provider for the final fill-and-finish of the clinical drug products.\nFor our future commercial products, we will need to develop additional manufacturing capabilities and establish additional third party suppliers to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates to undertake clinical trials and to manufacture sufficient quantities of any products that are approved for commercial sale. If we are unable to develop manufacturing capabilities internally or contract for large scale manufacturing with third parties on acceptable terms for our future antiviral products, our ability to conduct large-scale clinical trials and meet customer demand for commercial products would be adversely affected.\nWe believe that the technology we use to manufacture our products and compounds is proprietary. For our products, we may have to disclose all necessary aspects of this technology to contract manufacturers to enable them to manufacture the products and compounds for us. We plan to have discussions with manufacturers under non-disclosure and non-compete agreements that are intended to restrict them from using or revealing this technology, but we cannot be certain that these manufacturers will comply with these restrictions. In addition, these manufacturers could develop their own technology related to the work they perform for us that we may need to manufacture our products or compounds. We could be required to enter into an agreement with that manufacturer if we wanted to use that technology ourselves or allow another manufacturer to use that technology. The manufacturer could refuse to allow us to use their technology or could demand terms to use their technology that are not acceptable.\n 59 \nWe believe that we are in compliance with all material environmental regulations related to the manufacture of our products.\nCompetition\nOur products in development target a number of diseases and conditions that include several different kinds of viral infections. There are many commercially available products for these diseases and a large number of companies and institutions are spending considerable amounts of money and other resources to develop additional products to treat these diseases. Most of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. If we are able to successfully develop products, they would compete with existing products based primarily on:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>efficacy; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>safety; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>tolerability; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>acceptance by doctors; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>patient compliance; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>patent protection; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>ease of use; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>price; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>insurance and other reimbursement coverage; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>distribution; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>marketing; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>adaptability to various modes of dosing. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe current approved drugs for influenza include the neuraminidase inhibitors Tamiflu, Relenza, and Peramivir, anti-influenza drugs that are sold by Roche, Glaxo SmithKline (GSK), and BioCryst partners, respectively. In addition, M2 channel inhibitors, generic drugs include amantadine and rimantadine, both oral tablets that only inhibit the replication of the influenza A virus. There is significant viral resistance to the approved M2 channel inhibitors especially in the US. Several companies are developing anti-influenza drugs at present. Small chemical classes include neuraminidase inhibitors, M2-channel inhibitors, and RDRP inhibitors, among others. There are also monoclonal, polyclonal, and mixed antibodies, as well as enzymes as drugs in development.\nThere are a growing number of anti-HIV drugs being sold or in advanced stages of clinical development. Companies with HCV and HIV products include Gilead, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), in addition to several other pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms.\nThere are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of viral diseases of the external eye. A drug in development, called CTC-96, was shown to have little clinical benefit in published animal studies. Another drug in development, an Aganocide(tm) compound from NovaBay Pharma in collaboration with Alcon went through Phase II clinical studies. Alcon (a division of Novartis) discontinued further development of this drug following mixed results in a Phase II clinical trial. NovaBay regained the rights to it and continued further development. Aganocides, by virtue of their chemical structure, are generally not expected to be useful for any applications other than topical.\nThere are several drugs in the market that effectively control HSV cold sores and genital herpes lesions in most patients. These include the nucleoside analogues idoxuridine, vidarabine, acyclovir, famciclovir, and derivatives. However, their efficacy is limited or toxicities are high. Brincidofovir, based on the toxic drug cidofovir, is in development by Chimerix, but certain clinical trials involving brincidofovir have failed to meet the desired end points.\n 60 \nCurrently there are two accepted methods of rabies prophylaxis: rabies vaccines and rabies immune globulin, manufactured by many foreign and multinational manufacturers including Aventis Pasteur and Chiron (acquired by Novartis). These accepted methods will be the standard against which our new anti-rabies drug in development will be judged.\nIn order to compete successfully, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for therapeutic markets. Our products, even if successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d). The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these regulations, product development and the product approval process is very expensive and time consuming.\nThe FDA must license\u201d a drug before it can be sold in the United States. As of the date of this filing, the FDA has approved other nano-particulate drugs including Emend\u00ae by Merck and Rapamune\u00ae by Wyeth, as well as others. The general process for FDA approval is as follows:\nPreclinical Testing\nBefore we can test a drug candidate in humans, we must study the drug in laboratory experiments and in animals to generate data to support the drug's potential safety and benefits. We submit this data to the FDA in an investigational new drug application IND seeking their approval to test the compound in humans.\nClinical Trials\nIf the FDA accepts the investigational new drug application, we study the drug in human clinical trials to determine if the drug is safe and effective. These clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years to compile and are very expensive. These three phases, which are themselves subject to considerable regulation, are as follows:\n \u00b7 Phase I. The drug is given to a small number of healthy human subjects or patients to test for safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, distribution and excretion. \n \u00b7 Phase II. The drug is given to a limited patient population to determine the effect of the drug in treating the disease, the best dose of the drug, and the possible side effects and safety risks of the drug. \n \u00b7 Phase III. If a compound appears to be effective and safe in Phase II clinical trials, Phase III clinical trials are commenced to confirm those results. Phase III clinical trials are long-term, involve a significantly larger population, are conducted at numerous sites in different geographic regions and are carefully designed to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and benefits of a drug. It is not uncommon for a drug that appears promising in Phase II clinical trials to fail in the more rigorous and reliable Phase III clinical trials. \nFDA Approval Process\nIf we believe that the data from the Phase 3 clinical trials show an adequate level of safety and effectiveness, we will file a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA seeking approval to sell the drug for a particular use. The FDA will review the NDA and often will hold a public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisors asks additional questions regarding the drug. This committee makes a recommendation to the FDA that is not binding on the FDA but is generally followed. If the FDA agrees that the compound has met the required level of safety and effectiveness for a particular use, it will allow us to sell the drug in the United States for that use. It is not unusual, however, for the FDA to reject an application because it believes that the drug is not safe enough or effective enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted is reliable or conclusive.\n 61 \nAt any point in this process, the development of a drug could be stopped for a number of reasons including safety concerns and lack of treatment benefit. We cannot be certain that any clinical trials that we are currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future, will be completed successfully or within any specified time period. We may choose, or the FDA may require us, to delay or suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate does not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit.\nThe FDA may also require us to complete additional testing, provide additional data or information, improve our manufacturing processes, procedures or facilities or may require extensive post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or benefits of our product candidates if it determines that our new drug application does not contain adequate evidence of the safety and benefits of the drug. In addition, even if the FDA approves a drug, it could limit the uses of the drug. The FDA can withdraw approvals if it does not believe that we are complying with regulatory standards or if problems are uncovered or occur after approval.\nIn addition to obtaining FDA approval for each drug, we obtain FDA approval of the manufacturing facilities for any drug we sell, including those of companies who manufacture our drugs for us as well as our own and these facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA must also approve foreign establishments that manufacture products to be sold in the United States and these facilities are subject to periodic regulatory inspection.\nWe are also subject to other federal, state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. We use hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses and various radioactive compounds in our research and development activities and cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Any misuse or accidents involving these materials could lead to significant litigation, fines and penalties.\nDrugs are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the United States. In the European Union, there is a centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of a product in all countries in the European Union (which includes most major countries in Europe). If this procedure is not used, under a decentralized system, an approval in one country of the European Union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the European Union under a simplified application process at present. After approval under the centralized procedure, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries. These procedures are undergoing revision and modification at present. We have never received approval for a product in the European Union to date.\n 62 \nTime Schedules, Milestones and Development Costs\nIn the event that funding can be achieved, we shall endeavor to achieve completion of the following events within the next twelve months:\nThe status of each of our major research and development projects is as follows:\nTable 4: Drug Development Status\n Project 1 Injectable FluCide\u2122 against All Influenzas for Hospitalized Patients Current status We have declared a clinical candidate for influenza, NV-INF-1. This single drug is expected to be effective against most if not all influenza viruses. It is expected to be highly effective against all Influenza A viruses including bird flu H5N1 all clades, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenzas of all types, subtypes and strains, seasonal Influenzas, H7N9, H3N2, as well as 2009/H1N1 epidemic virus. We are now engaging into advanced pre-clinical drug development, or IND-enabling studies. We are currently performing synthesis scale up studies and the studies required for the Chemistry, Manufacture and Controls section of an IND application. We have performed initial safety/toxicology studies in small animals- mice and rats - intended at helping with the design of the full Safety and Toxicology studies ( Tox Package\u201d). We have prepared and used a first batch of materials for initial tox package studies. We intend to perform full Tox Package Studies when sufficient quantities become available. We also plan to perform additional animal studies as well as cell culture studies for efficacy of this drug candidate against a limited, unrelated influenza virus subtypes and strains. These studies are required for developing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the US FDA. Nature, timing and estimated costs The Company had budgeted approximately $1,500,000 for the material development, production and testing of this drug in 2012 and 2013, an additional $2M in 2014, and spent approximately $1.6M in 2015 on this project. These costs were paid from our available cash balances. Management has determined the results to be satisfactory. We now need to perform material characterization, pharmaco-kinetic, pharmaco-dynamic and toxicology studies, as well as extensive pre-clinical efficacy studies in both cell cultures and in animal models against a large number of different subtypes of Influenza viruses. We have presently budgeted this work plan at $2,500,000. If we are successful with the IND, we could begin Phase I and Phase II human clinical trials. We have estimated costs of approximately $5,000,000 for the initial human clinical trials and associated expenses of this drug candidate. The Company has sufficient cash in hand to cover the costs associated with the aforesaid studies and the initial human clinical trials. Anticipated completion date Preclinical stage workload remaining is approximately 12-18 months. However, because of the complexities of FluCide development including number of Influenza virus strains, etc., the project speed is limited by our available third party collaborations. We have now signed a collaborative agreement with the Webster Lab at the St. Jude Children's Hospital in Memphis, TN for this purpose. The Company anticipates filing an IND application after completion of the preclinical IND-enabling studies. Phase I drug testing to begin after the IND filing, and requires availability of cGMP-like manufactured product. The cGMP production capability is expected to be achieved in 9 to 12 months after we begin scale up production in the new facility. This project has priority level C, behind the Topical HerpeCide projects. Timing of commencement of expected material net cash inflows If we complete our preclinical studies in the next 12~18 months, and also are able to produce clinical batches at the end of this period, we can expect Phase I and Phase II human clinical trials to be completed at the earliest by 2018-2019. However, we have assigned a lower priority to this project, and this may cause reduced personnel, time, and budget allocation that could cause delays. Revenues may occur as a result of licensing the drug to another pharmaceutical partner at this stage. After Phase III clinical trials completion, revenues are expected to occur after FDA approval and marketing of the drug. Revenues may occur earlier if Flucide is approved for use in other countries or if the BARDA authority determines that FluCide should be stockpiled in the USG CDC stockpile of drugs for defense against pandemic influenza. If we are successful in partnering the drug with another pharmaceutical Company, we may see revenues much earlier than FDA approval. \n 63 \n The potential market for Injectable FluCide may be in the range of $300M to $3B, depending upon market penetration and other conditions. Our current manufacturing capability at the Shelton plant may be estimated to be capable of supplying approximately $50M-$200M of the demand at full-scale operation, depending upon the cost of the drug and the dose required. This production scale is believed to be sufficient for initial market entry and is expected to be able to produce revenues that can fuel a larger manufacturing capacity needed for this drug product. However, the Company intends to license commercial manufacture of this drug to a commercial partner. \n Project 2 Oral FluCide\u2122 against All Influenzas for Out-Patients Current status We have developed a highly effective anti-influenza drug candidate that is active when given orally. We believe that we will be able to optimize this drug candidate and declare a clinical candidate with a limited amount of structure-activity-relationship (SAR) efficacy studies. This single drug is expected to be effective against most if not all influenza viruses. It is expected to be highly effective against all Influenza A viruses including bird flu H5N1 all clades, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenzas of all types, subtypes and strains, seasonal Influenzas, H7N9, H3N2, as well as 2009/H1N1 epidemic virus. We are now engaging into advanced pre-clinical drug development, or IND-enabling studies. After completing the SAR studies, we will need to perform synthesis scale up studies and the studies required for the Chemistry, Manufacture and Controls section of an IND application. We believe that these studies will benefit from the studies already performed for the injectable FluCide version, as both the oral and injectable drug candidates employ the same virus-binding ligand. We intend to perform Safety and Toxicology studies ( Tox Package\u201d) when sufficient quantities become available. We also plan to perform additional animal studies as well as cell culture studies for efficacy of this drug candidate"}
