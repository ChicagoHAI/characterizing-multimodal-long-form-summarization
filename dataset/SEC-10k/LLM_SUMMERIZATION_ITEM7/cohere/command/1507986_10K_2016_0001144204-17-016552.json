Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion also contains forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on November 12, 2010 as a blank check company to serve as a vehicle to acquire through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more operating businesses. As previously disclosed, we completed the acquisitions of JetPay Payments, TX (f/k/a JetPay, LLC) and JetPay HR & Payroll (f/k/a A. D. Computer Corporation), on December 28, 2012, JetPay Payments, PA (f/k/a ACI Merchant Systems, LLC) on November 7, 2014, and JetPay Payments, FL (f/k/a CollectorSolutions, Inc.) on June 2, 2016.\nWe are a provider of payment services - debit and credit card processing, payroll and HCM services, and prepaid card services to businesses and their employees throughout the United States. We provide these services through four wholly-owned subsidiaries: JetPay Payments, TX, which provides debit and credit card processing and ACH payment services to businesses with a focus on those processing internet transactions and recurring billings; JetPay Payments, PA, an independent sales organization specializing in relationships with banks, credit unions, other financial institutions and strategic partners; JetPay Payments, FL, a debit and credit card processor specializing in providing services to government agencies and utilities; and JetPay HR & Payroll Services, which provides HCM services, including, payroll, tax filing, time and attendance, HR services, and Affordable Care Act and related services to small and medium-sized employers. We also provide prepaid card services within our HR & Payroll Services Segment.\nOur overall business strategy is to provide payment processing services to small to large-sized businesses with a high percentage of our revenues consisting of recurring revenues with strong margins and with relatively low capital requirements. Our corporate strategy is to increase our revenues through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Our organic growth strategy is focused on developing and increasing our current marketing and sales staff at JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services to penetrate new customer niches and geographic markets. Our organic growth strategy also includes cross marketing initiatives to sell credit and debit card processing services to JetPay HR & Payroll Services' payroll customers and payroll processing services to JetPay Payment Services' credit and debit card processing customers. Additionally, we will be seeking additional debt and/or equity capital to acquire additional credit and debit card processors, ISVs, ISOs and/or payroll processors to integrate into our JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services operations. Our acquisition strategy is focused on identifying small to medium-sized companies that either provide services similar to ours or services that expand our product and service offerings and/or our geographic reach. Both our JetPay Payment Services and our JetPay HR & Payroll Services operations have significant under-utilized processing capacity, which can be leveraged to create additional processing revenues without significant cost increases. Our overall strategy also includes looking for cost synergies as we continue to integrate the JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services operations in such areas as insurance costs, banking costs, employee benefit costs, and other selling, general and administrative cost as well as operating cost areas.\nJetPay Payment Services Segment\nRevenues\nJetPay Payments, TX and JetPay Payments, PA's revenues fall into two categories: transaction processing revenues and merchant discount revenues. As such, our two primary drivers are the number of transactions and merchant dollar volume. A third measure related to merchant dollar volume, for those merchants where we charge a percentage of the sale amount, is the average size of the transaction, as costs for processing the transaction tend to be fixed, so that the higher the average ticket, the more revenue we earn for a fixed cost. JetPay's discount revenues are generally a fixed percentage of the merchant's dollar volume, with interchange and other third-party fees passed through to the merchant without markup. Our billings to merchants primarily consist of these transaction fees and discount fees, as well as pass-through fees for other miscellaneous services, such as handling chargebacks. Interchange costs are set by the card networks, and are paid directly by the sponsoring bank to the credit card associations based upon a percentage of transaction amounts and/or a fixed price per transaction. JetPay Payment Services refers to the ratio of processing revenues to the dollar amount of card transactions processed as the margin.\u201d If margin increases, processing revenues will tend to increase accordingly. Further, both the number of merchants who process transactions, and the average dollar amount of transactions processed per merchant, will impact the total transaction volume and thus the total processing revenues. As such, growth in JetPay's merchant count and/or growth in the same store transaction volume will also drive JetPay's processing revenue growth.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nJetPay Payments, FL generates substantially all of its revenues from transaction fees for processing a payment transaction. For credit card transactions, our fee may be charged as a fixed fee or as a percentage of the dollars processed. As such, the two primary factors affecting our processing revenue from accepting and processing credit card payments are the number of transactions and the average dollar volume of the transaction. Accordingly, growth in JetPay Payments, FL's client count and growth in the same client\u201d transaction dollar volume impact JetPay Payments FL's processing revenue growth. In the case of e-check (ACH) payments, typically our fees are charged as a fixed fee per transaction regardless of the payment amount.\nExpenses\nThe most significant components of operating expenses are credit card association fees and assessments; residual payments to ISOs / VARs / ISVs, strategic partners, and financial institutions; and salaries and other employment costs. Salaries and other employment costs are largely fixed in nature, increasing slightly with the growth in numbers of customers, but tending to grow with inflation. Credit card fees and assessments and bank sponsorship costs are generally a percentage of card volume. Bank sponsorship costs and processing fees are largely based upon transaction counts and volumes. Selling, general and administrative expenses include stable costs such as occupancy and office costs, outside services, and depreciation and amortization expense, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Cost of processing revenues also includes chargeback losses, which vary over the long term based upon transaction volume processed by JetPay's merchants, but can vary from period to period depending upon specific events in that period. JetPay Payment Services has experienced higher than normal professional fees due to the Direct Air matter.\nMerchant Attrition\nMerchant attrition is a normal part of the merchant processing industry in the ordinary course of business. JetPay Payment Services does not experience attrition in the same form as most of its competitors. Most of JetPay Payment Services' competitors have large portfolios of small businesses and these businesses change their payments provider quickly and for many reasons. JetPay Payment Services' portfolio is made up of small to large businesses and they are more cautious in making changes to payment providers, and therefore, its portfolio is not as volatile. However, due to the volume that each of these merchants produce, when one leaves, it may have a significant impact on operating results. In addition, JetPay Payment Services provides processing services to several ISOs and financial institutions. While our volatility in terms of the change in number of merchants remains significant, we experience less volatility in revenues. JetPay Payment Services monitors its customer attrition for both numbers of merchants as well as merchant processing revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, in our traditional business, JetPay Payment Services' customer attrition was approximately 24.2%, or an approximate 2,169 merchant reduction from approximately 9,698 merchants existing at December 31, 2015. This reduction in merchants included one particular ISO customer whose attrition rate is high due to the nature of its business. This reduction was offset by the addition of approximately 2,032, or approximately 21.0%, new merchants, resulting in a net merchant attrition rate of approximately 3.1%. With respect to processing revenues, the lost merchants in 2016 represented a loss of approximately $2.4 million of annualized revenues, or approximately 5.9% of JetPay Payment Services' 2016 revenues of approximately $40.7 million.\nMarkets\nWe have defined four distinct segments within which JetPay Payment Services operates: (i) Integrated Software Vendors (ISVs), especially those that leverage the e-Commerce and Recurring Payments strengths of JetPay's technology platform, (ii) e-Commerce, including Card-Not-Present and recurring payments; (iii) government and utilities; and (iv) financial institutions and associations. JetPay also operates where we have strategic advantages due to technology, product, or relationships, including ISOs, VARs, and small businesses through cross-sell. For small businesses and financial institutions, JetPay Payment Services is the traditional provider of merchant services to businesses, and holds the contracts. With regard to the other three markets, JetPay Payment Services operates in two forms: (i) as a processor only where JetPay Payment Services recognizes revenue from the authorization, clearing, and settlement functions and does not participate in the discount revenue or risk of the merchant; and (ii) in a shared relationship, where JetPay Payment Services either owns the merchant contract outright or shares in the discount revenue of the merchant with an agent or ISO, and may assume or share risk. This market experienced strong growth in 2016 and JetPay Payment Services expects to significantly increase this revenue area as the operations group solidifies the product offering and execution. Our expansion in 2015 and 2016 was negatively affected by management's time being diverted to dealing with the Direct Air issue described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, as well as efforts devoted to our acquisition and integration of JetPay Payments, PA and JetPay Payments, FL. Sales and marketing began targeting new customers and customer segments in 2015 and 2016 and we anticipate such efforts will lead to continued revenue growth in 2017 and future years.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWithin our JetPay Payments, FL's operation, our focus is on government, utility, and not-for-profit entities. We identified these specific markets because, in our experience, these clients are experiencing a faster growth rate than the electronic payments industry in general, and tend to have a more favorable risk profile. We believe that clients in these markets provide us with growth not only from the initial acquisition of a client that may not have been previously accepting electronic payments or accepting only minimal electronic payments, but also additional growth as our client's customers learn of the ability to pay electronically as they increase their use and adoption of credit and debit card payments instead of check or cash payments.\nJetPay HR & Payroll Segment\nRevenues\nThe majority of revenues from JetPay HR & Payroll Services have traditionally been derived from its payroll processing operations, which includes the calculation, preparation, collection and delivery of employer payroll obligations and the production of internal accounting records and management reports, and from services provided for the preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns, including the collection and remittance of clients' payroll tax obligations. In 2016, JetPay Payroll and HR Services placed a significant emphasis on providing additional human capital management services that complement the core payroll and tax filing businesses, to include onboarding, time and attendance, compliance, and other services that are becoming increasingly important to employers with fifty (50) or more employees. JetPay anticipates that these revenues will become an increasingly important incremental source of revenues. JetPay HR & Payroll Services experiences increased revenues in the fourth and first calendar quarters due to additional employer annual tax filing requirements. Payroll Tax Filing Services ( PTFS\u201d) trust account earnings represent the interest earned on the funds held for clients trust balance. Trust fund earnings can fluctuate based on the amount held in the trust account as well as fluctuations in interest rates. Over the past two years, JetPay HR & Payroll Services has seen a significant increase in revenue from its human capital management, Affordable Care Act and time and attendance services.\nExpenses\nJetPay HR & Payroll Services' most significant cost of processing revenues is its payroll and related expenses, costs of third party service providers, and facility overhead costs. These costs are largely fixed in nature, increasing slightly with the growth in numbers of customers and payrolls processed, and except for payroll costs, tend to grow with inflation. JetPay HR & Payroll Services' selling, general, and administrative expenses include the costs of the administrative and sales staff, payroll delivery costs, outside services, rent, office expense, insurance, sales and marketing costs and professional services costs.\nCustomer Attrition\nCustomer attrition is a normal part of the payroll processing industry in the ordinary course of business. JetPay HR & Payroll Services' attrition generally comes in three forms - closure of a business, acquisition of a business wherein the payroll is transferred to the buyer, and loss of customers to competitors. As a result, JetPay HR & Payroll Services monitors its customer losses for both numbers of customers as well as customer revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, JetPay HR & Payroll Segment customer attrition was approximately 6.8%, or a 347 customer reduction from approximately 5,108 customers existing at December 31, 2015. This reduction was offset by the addition of approximately 470 new customers, or approximately 9.2% over the 5,108 customers existing at December 31, 2015, resulting in a net customer growth rate of approximately 2.4%. With respect to payroll processing revenues, the lost customers in 2016 represented a loss of approximately $92,500 of annualized revenues, or approximately 6.3% of JetPay HR & Payroll Services' 2015 processing revenues of approximately $14.6 million. The new customers that JetPay added in 2016 contributed to a net increase in processing revenues in 2016 of approximately $90,800 or 6.2% of 2016 revenues.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>30

for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Overall revenues increased $13.0 million, or 30.0%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. Of the $56.3 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, $15.6 million, or 27.8%, was generated from our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment and $40.7 million, or 72.2%, from our JetPay Payment Services Segment. Of the $43.3 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, $14.7 million, or 33.9%, was generated from our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment and $28.6 million, or 66.1%, from our JetPay Payment Services Segment.\nJetPay Payment Services Segment's revenues increased $12.1 million, or 42.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. Revenues from our JetPay Payments, PA operation increased $1.0 million, or 13.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, our Texas based JetPay Payment Services operation's revenues increased $816,000, or 3.8%, prior to eliminating inter-company revenues associated with JetPay Payments, FL of $1.0 million, in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, and our JetPay Payments, FL operation provided $11.3 million of revenues. The most significant changes within our JetPay Payments, TX operation was an increase of $1.3 million in our third party business and an increase of $773,000 in direct merchant services revenues. These gains were offset by a decrease of $1.26 million in our processing and clearing business, due mainly to a change in one of our larger customers' business operations.\nJetPay HR & Payroll Segment's revenues increased $877,000, or 6.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable to net growth in volume of payroll and related payroll taxes processed in addition to revenues generated from several new HR services introduced in 2015. Growth in our new HR related services was approximately $693,000 or 109.0% of our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment's revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of Processing Revenues\nCost of revenues were $37.5 million, or 66.5% of revenues, and $26.2 million, or 60.5% of revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of the $37.5 million cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, $7.9 million, or 21%, related to our HR & Payroll Segment, and $29.5 million, or 79%, related to our Payment Services Segment. Of the $26.2 million of cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, $7.3 million, or 27.9%, related to our HR & Payroll Segment and $18.8 million, or 72.1%, related to our Payment Services Segment.\nThe cost of processing revenues within the Payment Services Segment increased from $18.8 million, or 65.7% of revenues in 2015 to $29.5 million, or 72.5% of revenues in 2016, an increase of $10.7 million, or 57.1%. The increase in cost of processing revenues was primarily related to the growth in our Payment Processing Segment revenues, including the acquisition of JetPay Payments, FL which provided $7.1 million of cost of processing revenues. Cost of processing revenues was also impacted by increased card association and other direct processing costs with an increase in back-end settlement volumes. Overall gross profit margin as reported within our Payment Services Segment decreased from 34.3% in 2015 to 27.5% in 2016 largely as a result of the decrease in higher-margin front-end processing only revenues and the increase in lower-margin third party ISO revenues, combined with the impact of lower margin JetPay Payments, FL revenues and the continued investments made in technology professionals.\nThe cost of processing revenues within our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment increased $525,000, increasing as a percentage of revenues from 49.8% in 2015 to 50.4% in 2016 principally due to the increase in HR related service revenues and the continued investment in technology, customer service professionals and new product management. The effect of this increase in costs of processing revenues as a percentage of revenues was a decrease in gross profit margin within our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment from 50.2% in 2015 to 49.6% in 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses were $16.9 million, or 30.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $13.3 million, or 30.7% of revenues, for the same period in 2015.\nSG&A expenses within the Payment Services Segment increased from $6.9 million or 24.0% of revenues in 2015, to $9.3 million, or 22.7% of revenues in 2016. This increase was largely the result of SG&A expenses related to JetPay Payments, FL of $2.4 million and the continued increase in sales staff and marketing costs to attract new business.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSG&A expenses within our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment increased from $4.8 million in 2015 to $5.4 million in 2016, an increase of approximately $608,000, or 12.7%, largely due to an increase in payroll costs as additional sales and technology professionals were added to help develop new products and services and execute our HCM revenue growth strategies.\nAdditionally, we incurred corporate SG&A expenses of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, including the benefit of $1.9 million of management fees received from the Company's operating divisions as compared to corporate SG&A expenses of $1.7 million in the same period of 2015, including $1.43 million of management fees received from the operating divisions. Corporate SG&A expenses include, but are not limited to, the salaries of our executive officers, outside professional fees, acquisition costs, investor relations and other public company costs, and general corporate operating expenses. Corporate SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $669,000 of transaction costs related to the JetPay Payments, FL acquisition. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $399,000 as compared to $278,000 in 2015. The SG&A expenses of our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment include $360,000 and $350,000 of corporate allocated costs in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the Payment Processing Segment includes $1.54 million and $1.08 million of corporate allocated costs in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with an offsetting reduction in corporate SG&A expenses of $1.9 million and $1.43 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nSettlement of Legal Matter\nSettlement of Legal Matter charge of $6.19 million reflects the Company's loss based on the terms of the Merrick Settlement Agreement and the WLES Settlement Agreement. The loss includes: (i) a charge of $4.4 million related to the Company's release of all claims to the $4.4 million held in reserve at Merrick; (ii) a charge of $1.4 million related to the Company's issuance of the $3.85MM Note, less WLES' agreement to transfer to Merrick the WLES Note (recorded at $2,036,511 at June 30, 2016 net of an unamortized discount of $294,858) and accrued interest on the WLES Note of $414,466; (iii) a charge of $50,000 representing the Company's issuance of the $5.0MM Note, less the estimated value as of July 26, 2016 of the escrowed shares; and (iv) a charge for $373,334 representing the fair market value of the issuance of warrants to WLES on February 15, 2017 as described in the WLES Settlement Agreement.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization totaled $4.0 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily related to increased depreciation expense on 2016 capital expenditures and the amortization of the JetPay Payments, FL's intangible assets acquired on June 2, 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.2 million and $819,000, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2016 was primarily related to interest payments on the Fifth Third Bank term note issued on June 2, 2016 in connection with our acquisition of JetPay Payments, FL and the Notes issued to Merrick on July 26, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded income tax (benefit) expense of $(1.43) million and $197,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income tax expense reflects the recording of state income taxes. The effective tax rates were approximately (14.8)% and (19.7)% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year, primarily due to state and local income taxes and changes to the valuation allowance. Additionally, with the acquisition of JetPay Payments, FL and its related identifiable intangible and fixed assets, management recorded an associated $1.86 million deferred tax liability. Management believed that it was more likely than not that the benefit of a portion of its federal net deferred tax assets would be realized equal to the future source of income created by the amortization of the JetPay Payments, FL identifiable intangible and fixed asset assets, and accordingly, recorded a partial reduction of the valuation allowance against its federal deferred tax assets of $1.6 million.\nAnalysis of Impairment\nThe Company conducts its annual goodwill impairment testing as of December 31 of each year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We performed extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market approaches, in our goodwill assessment process for our two identified reporting units that contained goodwill, JetPay Payment Processing and JetPay HR & Payroll reporting segments.\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn our income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) analysis for each of our previously identified reporting units using discount rates of 16.5% for both our JetPay Payment Processing and JetPay HR & Payroll reporting segments, which represent the estimated weighted average cost of capital. These discount rates reflect the overall level of inherent risk involved in our reporting units and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In our DCF analysis, we prepared a five year forecast of our expected earnings to derive an expected stream of free cash flow through December 31, 2021. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our forecast, we used a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we estimated operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model, adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth assumption and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value. In developing our forecasts of revenues and direct variable operating expenses, we utilized a variety of factors including our current and anticipated sales pipelines of prospects currently known to us, as well as those which we believe will be generated through current and future relationships with merchants, agent banks and ISOs. We also applied our knowledge of the industries, general economic conditions, and the forecast of industry experts regarding consumers' continued trending towards expanded use of electronic payment methods. Our operating expenses are either variable with revenues, or fixed and predictable; however, we increased our future costs based on expected inflation and the need to expand personnel costs as we achieve projected future revenue levels. In performing our DCF analysis, we multiplied our estimated cash flows by a marginal federal and state tax rate of 40% to derive our after-tax cash flows, and we utilized weighted average costs of capital of 16.5% for both our JetPay Payment Processing reporting segment and JetPay HR & Payroll reporting segment analysis. In addition to the income approach, we also used several market-based approaches to corroborate the results of the income approach described above; including comparing our company's various earnings and performance indicators to those of similar publicly traded companies, comparisons to prior purchase and sales transactions of similar reporting units by companies, and a comparison to recent mergers and acquisitions of guideline companies.\nWith respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our JetPay Payment Processing reporting segment, as of December 31, 2016, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit was $69.8 million which exceeded the carrying value of net assets by $21.4 million, or 44.2%. With respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our JetPay HR & Payroll reporting segment, as of December 31, 2016, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit was $39.5 million which exceeded the carrying value of net assets by $13.5 million, or 51.9%. Events or circumstances that could have a negative effect on estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future include, but are not limited to, a loss of customers due to competition, pressure from our customers to reduce pricing, inability to continue to employ a competent workforce at current rates of pay, changes in government regulations, and accelerating costs beyond management's control.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents were $12.6 million at December 31, 2016, excluding $2.1 million of cash deposited into restricted cash accounts. The ratio of our total debt to total capitalization, which consists of total debt, convertible preferred stock, and stockholders' equity, was 25% and 23% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had working capital, excluding funds held for clients and client funds obligations, of approximately $5.0 million.\nWe expect to fund our cash needs, including capital required for acquisitions, with cash flow from our operating activities, sales of equity securities and borrowings. Additionally, we will require approximately $5.2 million, after giving effect to the payoff of a $5.0 million promissory note payable to Merrick Bank Corporation on January 11, 2017, See Note 17. Subsequent Events in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, to cover our interest and principal payments on our existing debt for the fifteen months ending March 31, 2018, capital expenditures of $3.9 million; and $314,000 of deferred consideration paid to the unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA on January 17, 2017. We expect to fund our cash needs for the next fifteen months, including debt service requirements, capital expenditures and possible future acquisitions, with cash flow from its operating activities, sales of equity securities (including the recent sale of preferred stock and borrowings, see below) and through new borrowings. As disclosed in Note 11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, from October 11, 2013 to October 18, 2016, we sold 99,666 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series A Preferred\u201d), to Flexpoint for an aggregate of $29.9 million, less certain costs. Additionally, on October 18, 2016, we sold 33,667 shares of Series A Preferred to Sundara for $10.1 million, less certain costs. In connection with the sale of shares of Series A Preferred to Sundara, we also entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with an affiliate of Sundara, LHLJ, Inc., for a term loan in the principal amount of $9.5 million, with $5.175 million of the proceeds used to simultaneously satisfy the remaining balances of a term loan and a revolving credit note payable to First National Bank of Pennsylvania (f/k/a Metro Bank) ( FNB\u201d) (the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Services Credit Facility\u201d). See Note 10. Long-Term debt, Note Payable and Capital Lease Obligations. Both Sundara and LHLJ are owned and controlled by Laurence L. Stone, who was appointed as a director of the Company pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated Series A Purchase Agreement. These two transactions provided approximately $14.0 million of net working capital which we used and expect to use for general working capital needs, the payment of other debt instruments, and for future capital needs, including a portion of the cost of potential future acquisitions. Finally, from May 5, 2014 to December 31, 2014, we sold 6,165 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series A-1 Preferred\u201d), to affiliates of Wellington Capital Management, LLP ( Wellington\u201d) for an aggregate of $1.85 million. Additionally, as disclosed in Note 12. Stockholders' Equity, from December 22, 2015 to January 22, 2016, we sold to certain accredited investors, including Bipin C. Shah, Robert B. Palmer, and Jonathan M. Lubert, an aggregate of 517,037 shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $2.70 per share for aggregate consideration of $1,396,000, prior to issuance costs.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital expenditures were $819,000 and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We currently estimate capital expenditures for all of our ongoing operations, including JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services, at approximately $3.0 million to $3.9 million for 2017, principally related to technology improvements and the implementation of major new customer contracts. Our capital requirements include working capital for daily operations, including expenditures to maintain and upgrade our technology platforms. Our operations currently generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our current operating needs and our routine debt service requirements.\nIn the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing by obtaining loans and selling shares of our equity securities, including the sale of shares Series A Preferred to Flexpoint and Sundara and the sale of shares of Series A-1 Preferred to Wellington. To fund and integrate future acquisitions or expand our technology platforms for new business initiatives, we will need to raise additional capital through loans, the sale of Series A-1 Preferred, or other sales of equity securities. In addition, we continue to investigate the capital markets for sources of funding, which could take the form of additional debt or equity financing. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in securing new financing or restructuring our current debt, or that we will secure such future financing with commercially acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may need to delay certain technology capital improvements, limit our planned level of capital expenditures and future growth plans or dispose of operating assets to generate cash to sustain operations and fund ongoing capital investments.\nDebt Capitalization and Other Financing Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2016, we had borrowings of approximately $21.9 million net of an unamortized deferred financing costs of $339,000.\nOn December 28, 2012, JetPay HR & Payroll Services and PTFS, as borrowers, entered into the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Credit Facility with FNB as the lender for a term loan with a principal amount of $9,000,000. Amounts outstanding under the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Credit Facility accrued interest at a rate of 4% per annum. The loan was schedule to mature on December 28, 2019, but was paid in full in October 2016, in connection with the LHLJ, Inc. ( LHLJ\u201d) loan.\nIn connection with the closing of our acquisitions of JetPay Payments, TX and JetPay HR & Payroll Services, we entered into a Note and Indemnity Side Agreement. Pursuant to the Note and Indemnity Side Agreement, we agreed to issue the WLES Note. Interest accrued on amounts due under the WLES Note at a rate of 5% per annum. Under the terms of the WLES Settlement Agreement, WLES transferred the WLES Note to Merrick on July 26, 2016. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies.\nOn November 7, 2014, pursuant to a Unit Purchase Agreement by and between the Company, JetPay Payments, PA and Michael Collester and Cathy Smith, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of JetPay Payments, PA for an aggregate of $11.0 million in cash and the issuance of 2.0 million shares of its common stock to the unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA with a value of approximately $3.7 million on the date of acquisition. The previous unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA were entitled to receive additional cash consideration of $2.4 million, $1.2 million of which was paid on April 10, 2015 and $1.2 million of which was paid on April 10, 2016, and were entitled to earn up to an additional $500,000 based on the net revenues of JetPay Payments, PA for the twelve month periods ended October 31, 2015 and 2016, of which $186,000 was paid to the previous unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA in February 2016 and $314,000 on January 17, 2017, satisfying this obligation in full. In order to finance a portion of the proceeds paid to the previous unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA, JetPay Payments, PA, as borrower, and the Company and JetPay HR & Payroll Services, as guarantors, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement on November 7, 2014 with FNB with a principal amount of $7.5 million (as amended, the JetPay Payments, PA Credit Facility\u201d). Amounts outstanding under the loan accrue interest at a rate of 5.25% per annum. The loan matures on November 6, 2021 and amortizes in equal monthly installments of $104,167. The principal balance of this term loan was $6.04 million at December 31, 2016. Additional principal payments may be required at the end of each fiscal year based on a free cash flow calculation set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn May 6, 2015, JetPay HR & Payroll Services and PTFS, as borrowers, along with the Company, JetPay Payments, PA, and JetPay, Payments, TX, collectively as loan parties, entered into a First Amendment and Joinder Agreement to the Loan and Security Agreement dated December 28, 2012 and a Revolving Credit Note (the Revolving Note\u201d) dated May 6, 2015 with FNB, as the lender. The Revolving Note provided a $1.0 million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on May 6, 2017 and accrued interest at the rate of the Wall Street Journal Prime rate plus 1.00%, with a floor of 4.25%. On May 6, 2015, the proceeds of the $1.0 million Revolving Note, along with $650,000 of current cash and cash equivalents, were used to partially fund a $2.0 million deferred consideration liability due to the stockholders of ADC. The Revolving Note was paid in full on October 18, 2016.\nOn January 15, 2016, we issued promissory notes to each of Messrs. Shah and Lubert, and Flexpoint. The promissory notes each had an interest rate of 12% per annum and were scheduled to mature on April 14, 2016. The $1.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the promissory notes was used as cash collateral recorded as restricted cash to replace a $1.9 million letter of credit in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. On April 11, 2016, the Company entered into letter agreements with each of Messrs. Shah and Lubert, and Flexpoint to extend until July 31, 2016 the maturity dates of the Promissory Notes. On July 26, 2016, Jonathan Lubert and Flexpoint agreed to further extend their promissory notes to September 30, 2016. Additionally, Flexpoint increased the principal amount of its promissory note from $1,000,000 to $1,400,000. On September 30, 2016, Jonathan Lubert and Flexpoint extended the term of their promissory notes to October 31, 2016. Each of the he promissory notes were repaid on October 21, 2016. We are currently working with several financial institutions to secure a $1.9 million letter of credit at which time the restricted cash reserves would be released to the Company. There can be no assurance that a letter of credit will be obtained or obtained on reasonable terms.\nOn June 2, 2016, in connection with the closing of the JetPay Payments, FL acquisition, JetPay Payments, FL and the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Fifth Third Bank. In connection with the Credit Agreement, JetPay Payments, FL issued in favor of Fifth Third Bank a term note with a principal amount of $1,068,960 and a $500,000 revolving note to refinance certain credit arrangements of JetPay Payments, FL in place at another financial institution prior to the closing of the transaction. The term note matures on November 30, 2019 and bears interest at 4.00%. The revolving note matures on June 2, 2017 and the bears interest at a rate of 2.00% plus the LIBOR Rate for the applicable interest period. The term note and the revolving note are secured by the assets of JetPay Payments, FL and guaranteed by JetPay. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants, including a financial covenant related to JetPay Payments, FL's fixed charge coverage ratio, which the Company was in compliance as of December 31, 2016.\nOn July 26, 2016, as part of the Merrick Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to issue in favor of Merrick the $3.85MM Note and the $5.00MM Note. The Notes were secured by the 3,333,333 shares of JetPay's common stock issued in the name of WLES and held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (described above). The $3.85MM Note was satisfied in full on October 21, 2016 and the $5.00MM Note was satisfied in full on January 11, 2017.\nOn October 18, 2016, JetPay HR & Payroll Services and PTFS, as borrowers, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement\u201d) with LHLJ, Inc., a Delaware corporation controlled by Laurence L. Stone, as lender, for a term loan in the principal amount of $9.5 million (the LHLJ Debt Investment\u201d). The underlying promissory note bears interest at 8%. The loan matures on October 18, 2021 and is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of $128,677 with a final payment of $4.75 million at maturity. The obligations of the borrowers under the Loan Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and JetPay Payments, FL, and are secured by all of the assets of JetPay HR & Payroll Services, PTFS and JetPay Payments, FL, as well as a pledge by the Company of its ownership interests in JetPay HR & Payroll Services, PTFS and JetPay Payments, FL. The Loan Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates and other customary restrictions for loans of this type and size. The borrowers are also subject to financial covenants relating to their debt coverage ratio and total leverage ratio during the term of the loan. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2016. The principal balance of this term loan was $9.37 million at December 31, 2016.\nA portion of the proceeds of the LHLJ Debt Investment was used to simultaneously satisfy the remaining balance of $4.175 million outstanding under the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Services Credit Facility. In connection with the satisfaction of the Borrowers' obligations under the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Services Credit Facility, JetPay Payments, PA, JetPay HR & Payroll Services, the Company and FNB entered into an amendment to the JetPay Payments, PA Credit Facility to release JetPay HR & Payroll Service's guaranty of the obligations of JetPay Payments, PA under the JetPay Payments, PA Credit Facility and to eliminate provisions relating to the cross-collateralization of the JetPay Payments, PA Credit Facility and the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Services Credit Facility.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur ongoing ability to comply with the debt covenants under our credit arrangements and to refinance our debt depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of cash flow. If our future cash flows are less than expected or our debt service, including interest expense, increases more than expected, causing us to default on any of the loan covenants in the future, we will need to obtain amendments or waivers from the applicable lender. In the event that non-compliance with the debt covenants should occur in the future, we would pursue various alternatives in an attempt to successfully resolve the non-compliance, which might include, among other things, seeking additional debt covenant waivers or amendments or refinancing debt with other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that debt covenant waivers or amendments would be obtained, if needed, or that the debt could be refinanced with other financial institutions on favorable terms.\nAdditionally, in connection with the December 2012 $9.0 million term loan, the November 2014 $7.5 million term loan, and the May 2015 Revolving Note, all payable to FNB, we incurred $23,000, $76,000, and $40,000 of deferred financing costs, respectively. Finally, we incurred (i) $95,000 of deferred financing fees related to the issuance of the Promissory Notes and (ii) $16,600 of deferred financing fees related to JetPay Payments, FL's term note and revolving note, each in favor of Fifth Third Bank, and $310,000 of deferred financing fees related to the LHLJ, Inc. Loan Agreement. Unamortized deferred financing costs were $339,000 at December 31, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016 consisted of an outstanding letter of credit of $100,000 which represents collateral with respect to a front-end processing relationship with a credit card company.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are obligated under various operating leases, primarily for office space and certain equipment related to our operations. Certain of these leases contain purchase options, renewal provisions, and contingent rentals for our proportionate share of taxes, utilities, insurance, and annual cost of living increases.\nThe following are summaries of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at December 31, 2016, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs (in thousands):\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual obligations (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\nOne Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One to Three\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three to Five\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term debt, notes payable and capital lease obligation (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum operating lease payments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts Expiring Per Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other Commercial Commitments </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\nOne Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One to Three\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three to Five\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Standby letters of credit (2) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Related interest obligations have been excluded from this maturity schedule.

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash provided by operating activities in this period was primarily due to a net loss of $8.2 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $1.0 million, and an increase in deferred income tax liability of $1.6 million, all offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization relating to fixed assets, intangible assets, non-cash interest costs and debt discounts of $4.3 million, stock based compensation expenses of $446,000, recognition of a note payable in connection with the settlement of a legal matter of $1.85 million, a decrease in other assets of $4.1 million, a net decrease in settlement processing assets and liabilities of $1.4 million, and an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities of $233,000.\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities in this period was primarily due to a net loss of $1.2 million, offset by non-cash amortization relating to intangible assets, non-cash interest costs and debt discounts and conversion options, and depreciation and amortization expense totaling $3.9 million, and a decrease in restricted cash of $1.2 million. This increase in cash was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $357,000, and an increase in accounts receivable of $489,000.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, including purchases of property and equipment of $716,000, an investment in acquired JetPay Payments, FL technology of $623,000 and an increase of $819,000 in restricted cash and equivalents held to satisfy client obligations, all partially offset by cash acquired in the JetPay Payments, FL acquisition of $520,000.\nCash used in investing activities totaled $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, is primarily due to an increase of $7.5 million in restricted cash and equivalents held to satisfy client obligations and the purchase of property and equipment of $875,000.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which included proceeds from issuance of promissory notes of $11.5 million, proceeds from the sale of preferred stock, net of issuance costs, of $12.4 million, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $47,000, and proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs, of $64,000,and an increase of $819,000 in client fund obligations, all partially offset by $14.0 million of cash used for payments on long-term debt, an increase in restricted cash reserves of $1.9 million, payment of deferred and contingent acquisition consideration of $1.4 million, and payment of deferred financing fees associated with new borrowings of $421,000.\nCash provided by financing activities totaled $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which included an increase of $7.5 million in client fund obligations, proceeds from a revolving credit facility of $1.0 million, and $1.3 million from the sale of common stock, all partially offset by $1.6 million of cash used for payments on long-term debt and the payment of $2.85 million of deferred acquisition consideration.\nSeasonality\nJetPay Payments, TX's and JetPay Payments, PA's revenues and earnings are impacted by the volume of consumer usage of credit and debit cards. For example, JetPay Payment Services experiences increased purchase activity during the first and second quarters due to seasonal volumes of some merchants in JetPay Payment Services' portfolio. Revenues during the first and second quarters tend to increase in comparison to the remaining two quarters of JetPay Payment Services' fiscal year on a same store basis.\nJetPay Payments, FL's expects increased revenues during the first and fourth quarters due to seasonal volumes of certain government and utility clients and their billing cycles.\nJetPay HR & Payroll Services' revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned. JetPay HR & Payroll Services experiences increased revenues during the fourth and first quarters due to the processing of additional year-end tax filing requirements. Accordingly, revenues and earnings are greater in the fourth and first quarter in comparison to the remaining two quarters of JetPay HR & Payroll Services' fiscal year.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEffects of Inflation\nJetPay Payment Services' and JetPay HR & Payroll Services' monetary assets, consisting primarily of cash and receivables, are not significantly affected by inflation. Non-monetary assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, are not affected by inflation. We believe that replacement costs of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and other operating expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us. The rate of inflation can also affect our revenues by affecting our client's payroll processing volumes and our merchant charge volume and corresponding changes to processing revenues. While these can be positive or negative, since a portion of JetPay Payment Services' revenues are derived as a percentage of dollar volume processed, JetPay Payment Services' revenues will generally rise when inflation rises. Additionally, JetPay HR & Payroll Services' revenues include the interest earned on the funds held for clients investment trust account balance. Trust fund earnings can fluctuate based on the amount held in the trust account as well as fluctuations in interest rates.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company's critical accounting policies are described below.\nUse of Estimates\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company's financial statements. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the value of purchase consideration of acquisitions; valuation of accounts receivable, reserves for chargebacks, goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; legal contingencies; and assumptions used in the calculation of stock-based compensation and in the calculation of income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe recognize revenue in general when the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, a customer contract or purchase order exists and the fees are fixed and determinable, no significant obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Allowances for chargebacks, discounts and other allowances are estimated and recorded concurrent with the recognition of revenue and are primarily based on historic rates.\nRevenues from our credit and debit card processing operations are recognized in the period services are rendered as we process credit and debit card transactions for our merchant customers or for merchant customers of our third party clients. Third party clients include ISOs, VARs, ISVs and financial institutions. The majority of our revenue within our credit and debit card processing business is comprised of transaction-based fees, which typically constitute a percentage of dollar volume processed, or a fee per transaction processed. In the case where we are only the processor of transactions, we charge transaction fees only and record these fees as revenues. In the case of contracts pursuant to which we process credit and debit card transactions for the third parties' merchant customers, revenues are primarily comprised of fees charged to the merchant, as well as a percentage of the processed sale transaction. Our contracts in most instances involve three parties: us, the merchant, and the sponsoring bank. Under certain of these sales arrangements, our sponsoring bank collects the gross revenue from the merchants, pays the interchange fees and assessments to the credit card associations, collects their fees and pays us a net residual payment representing our fee for the services provided. Accordingly, under these arrangements, we record the revenue net of interchange, credit card association assessments and fees and the sponsoring bank's fees. Under the majority of our sales arrangements, we are billed directly for certain fees by the credit card associations and the processing bank. In this instance, revenues and cost of revenues include the credit card association fees and assessments and the sponsoring bank's fees which are billed to us and for which we assume credit risk. In all of the above instances, we recognize processing revenues net of interchange fees, which are assessed to our merchant and third party merchant customers on all processed transactions. Interchange rates and fees are not controlled by us. We effectively function as a clearing house collecting and remitting interchange fee settlement on behalf of issuing banks, debit networks, credit card associations and their processing customers.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nJetPay Payments, FL functions as the merchant of record and has the primary responsibility for providing end-to-end payment processing services for its clients. JetPay Payments, FL's clients contract with us for all credit card processing services including transaction authorization, settlement, dispute resolution, security and risk management solutions, reporting and other value-added services. As such, JetPay Payments, FL is the primary obligor in these transactions and is solely responsible for all processing costs, including interchange fees. Further, JetPay Payments, FL sets prices as it deems reasonable for each merchant. The gross fees JetPay Payments, FL collects are intended to cover the interchange, assessments, and other processing fees and include JetPay Payments, FL's margin on the transactions processed. For these reasons, JetPay Payments, FL is the principal obligor in the contractual relationship with its customers and therefore JetPay Payments, FL records its revenues, including interchange and assessments, on a gross basis. Revenues reported by JetPay Payments, FL include interchange fees of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other fees assessed by JetPay Payments, FL to certain customers and remitted to partner entities for web and IVR supporting services provided by JetPay Payments, FL's partner entities are presented on a net basis. The Company follows the guidance provided in ASC Topic 605-45, Revenue Recognition - Principal Agent Considerations. ASC 605-45 states that whether a company should recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained is a matter of judgment that depends on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement and that certain factors are considered in the evaluation.\nAdditionally, our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amounts from the merchants due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral from certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk.\nRevenues from our JetPay HR & Payroll Services operations are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized over the service period based on when the efforts and costs are expended. Our service revenues are largely attributable to payroll-related processing services where the fees are based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. The revenues earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in processing revenues, and the costs for delivery are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employee. These collections from clients are typically remitted between one (1) and thirty (30) days after receipt, with some items extending to ninety (90) days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services.\nReserve for Chargeback Losses\nDisputes between a cardholder and a merchant periodically arise as a result of, among other things, cardholder dissatisfaction with merchandise quality or merchant services. Such disputes may not be resolved in the merchant's favor. In these cases, the transaction is charged back\u201d to the merchant, which means the purchase price is refunded to the customer through the merchant's bank and charged to the merchant. If the merchant has inadequate funds, the Company must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the transaction. The Company evaluates the risk for such transactions and estimates the potential loss for chargebacks based primarily on historical experience and records a loss reserve accordingly. We believe our reserve for chargeback losses is adequate to cover both the known probable losses and the incurred but not yet reported losses at the balance sheet dates. Chargeback reserves totaling $436,000 and $306,000 were recorded as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, settlement processing assets and liabilities, prepaid expenses and other current assets, funds held for clients, other assets and accrued expenses, deferred revenue, other current liabilities and client fund obligations, approximated fair value as of the balance sheet dates presented, because of the relatively short maturity dates on these instruments. The carrying amounts of the financing arrangements approximate fair value as of the balance sheet dates presented, because interest rates on these instruments approximate market interest rates after consideration of stated interest rates, anti-dilution protection and associated warrants.\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially expose us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, settlement processing assets and funds held for clients. Our cash and cash equivalents are deposited with major financial institutions. At times, such deposits may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurable amount.\nAccounts Receivable\nOur accounts receivable are due from merchant credit card and payroll customers. Credit is extended based on the evaluation of customers' financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Payment terms vary but are typically collected via ACH payments originated by us two (2) to three (3) days following month end. Amounts due from customers are stated in the financial statements net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts which are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. We determine our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, our previous loss history, the customer's current ability to pay its obligation to us, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. We write off accounts receivables when they are deemed uncollectible.\nSettlement Processing Assets and Obligations\nFunds settlement refers to the process of transferring funds for sales and credits between card issuers and merchants. Depending on the type of transaction, either the credit card interchange system or the debit network is used to transfer the information and funds between the sponsoring bank and card issuing bank to complete the link between merchants and card issuers. In certain of our processing arrangements, merchant funding primarily occurs after the sponsoring bank receives the funds from the card issuer through the card networks, creating a net settlement obligation on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In a limited number of other arrangements, the sponsoring bank funds the merchants before it receives the net settlement funds from the card networks, creating a net settlement asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, certain of our sponsoring banks collect the gross revenue from the merchants, pay the interchange fees and assessments to the credit card associations, collect their fees for processing and pay us a net residual payment representing our fees for the services. In these instances, we do not reflect the related settlement processing assets and obligations in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nTiming differences in processing credit and debit card and ACH transactions, as described above, interchange expense collection, merchant reserves, sponsoring bank reserves, and exception items result in settlement processing assets and obligations. Settlement processing assets consist primarily of our portion of settlement assets due from customers and receivable from merchants for the portion of the discount fee related to reimbursement of the interchange expense, our receivable from the processing bank for transactions we have funded merchants in advance of receipt of card association funding, merchant reserves held, sponsoring bank reserves and exception items, such as customer chargeback amounts receivable from merchants. Settlement processing obligations consist primarily of merchant reserves, our liability to the processing bank for transactions for which we have received funding from the members but have not funded merchants and exception items.\nSettlement assets and obligations resulting from JetPay Payments, FL's processing services and associated settlement activities include settlement receivables due from credit card associations and debit networks and certain cash accounts to which JetPay Payments, FL does not have legal ownership but has the right to use the accounts to satisfy the related settlement obligations. JetPay Payments, FL's corresponding settlement obligations are for amounts payable to customers, net of processing fees earned by JetPay Payments, FL. Settlement receivables and payables for credit and debit card transactions are recorded at the gross transaction amounts. The gross amounts are then processed through JetPay Payments, FL's settlement accounts, and JetPay Payments, FL retains its fees for the transactions upon settlement. Settlement receivables for e-check transactions consist of only JetPay Payments, FL's fees for the transactions. Settlement receivables are generally collected within four (4) business days. Settlement obligations are generally paid within three (3) business days, regardless of when the related settlement receivables are collected.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in our business combinations. We perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which are dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for the businesses, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We conduct our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31 of each year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We periodically analyze whether any such indicators of impairment exist. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition and/or slower expected growth rates, adverse actions or assessments by a regulator, among others. We compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying value, including related goodwill. Future changes in the industry could impact the results of future annual impairment tests. Our annual goodwill impairment testing indicated there was no impairment as of December 31, 2016. There can be no assurance that future tests of goodwill impairment will not result in impairment charges.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nIdentifiable intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, software costs, and tradenames. Certain tradenames are considered to have indefinite lives, and as such, are not subject to amortization. These assets are tested for impairment using undiscounted cash flow methodology annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Several impairment indicators are beyond our control, and determining whether or not they will occur cannot be predicted with any certainty. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective assigned estimated lives; customer relationships use eight (8) to fifteen (15) years; tradenames use one (1) to three (3) years; and software costs use one (1) to eight (8) years.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe periodically reviews the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and used at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review. If significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. Cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets, rather than a single asset. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we determine whether impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded. Our annual testing indicated there was no impairment as of December 31, 2016.\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nWe account for the redemption premium, beneficial conversion feature and issuance costs on or of our convertible preferred stock using the effective interest method, accreting such amounts to our convertible preferred stock from the date of issuance to the earliest date of redemption.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe expense employee share-based payments under ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of share-based payments to be recognized over the requisite service period. We estimate the grant date fair value of the share-based awards issued in the form of options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. We review the terms of debt instruments we enter into to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, including embedded conversion options, which are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments. In circumstances where the host instrument contains more than one embedded derivative instrument, including the conversion option, that is required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single compound derivative instrument.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBifurcated embedded derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as non-operating income or expense. When the equity or convertible debt instruments contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds received are first allocated to the fair value of all the bifurcated derivative instruments. The remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the host instruments themselves, usually resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face value. The discount from the face value of the convertible debt, together with the stated interest on the instrument, is amortized over the life of the instrument through periodic charges recorded within other expenses (income), using the effective interest method.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe account for fair value measurements in accordance with ASC Topic No. 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC Topic 820\u201d), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 are described below:\nTable 128: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>Level 1 </td> <td>Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>Level 2 </td> <td>Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>Level 3 </td> <td>Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC Topic 740\u201d). ASC Topic 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carryovers. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) represents the change during the period in the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities. In establishing the provision for income taxes and determining deferred income tax assets and liabilities, we make judgments and interpretations based on enacted laws, published tax guidance and estimates of future earnings. ASC Topic 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred income tax asset will not be realized.\nASC Topic 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We are required to file income tax returns in the United States (federal) and in various state and local jurisdictions. Based on our evaluation, it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in our financial statements. We believe that our income tax positions and deductions would be sustained upon examination and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in material changes to its financial position.\nOur policy for recording interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits is to record such interest and penalties as interest expense and as a component of selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. There were no amounts accrued for penalties or interest as of or during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Management does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits in the next year.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The ASU simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes under U.S. GAAP by requiring that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current. The guidance in ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. JetPay has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on JetPay's consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). This ASU amends the principal versus agent guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which was issued in May 2014 ( ASU 2014-09\u201d). Further, in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. This ASU also amends ASU 2014-09 and is related to the identification of performance obligations and accounting for licenses. Most recently, in December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This amendment affects narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2014-09. The effective date and transition requirements for all of these amendments to ASU 2014-09 are the same as those of ASU 2014-09, which was deferred for one year by ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. That is, the guidance under these standards is to be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method, as outlined in the guidance, and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of each of these standards and assessing their impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU makes targeted amendments to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This guidance is to be applied using various transition methods such as full retrospective, modified retrospective, and prospective based on the criteria for the specific amendments as outlined in the guidance. The guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted, as long as all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 36): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which provides guidance that will change the accounting for credit impairment. Under the new guidance, companies are required to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historic experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposure. This new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Clarification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d), which eliminates the diversity in practice related to classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, by adding or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. This new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash ( ASU 2016-18), which provides guidance that will require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. As a result, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This ASU clarifies the definition of a business when evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which required computing the implied fair value of goodwill. Under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This new guidance will be effective January 1, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.", "summary": "- Overall revenues

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion also contains forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on November 12, 2010 as a blank check company to serve as a vehicle to acquire through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more operating businesses. As previously disclosed, we completed the acquisitions of JetPay Payments, TX (f/k/a JetPay, LLC) and JetPay HR & Payroll (f/k/a A. D. Computer Corporation), on December 28, 2012, JetPay Payments, PA (f/k/a ACI Merchant Systems, LLC) on November 7, 2014, and JetPay Payments, FL (f/k/a CollectorSolutions, Inc.) on June 2, 2016.\nWe are a provider of payment services - debit and credit card processing, payroll and HCM services, and prepaid card services to businesses and their employees throughout the United States. We provide these services through four wholly-owned subsidiaries: JetPay Payments, TX, which provides debit and credit card processing and ACH payment services to businesses with a focus on those processing internet transactions and recurring billings; JetPay Payments, PA, an independent sales organization specializing in relationships with banks, credit unions, other financial institutions and strategic partners; JetPay Payments, FL, a debit and credit card processor specializing in providing services to government agencies and utilities; and JetPay HR & Payroll Services, which provides HCM services, including, payroll, tax filing, time and attendance, HR services, and Affordable Care Act and related services to small and medium-sized employers. We also provide prepaid card services within our HR & Payroll Services Segment.\nOur overall business strategy is to provide payment processing services to small to large-sized businesses with a high percentage of our revenues consisting of recurring revenues with strong margins and with relatively low capital requirements. Our corporate strategy is to increase our revenues through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Our organic growth strategy is focused on developing and increasing our current marketing and sales staff at JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services to penetrate new customer niches and geographic markets. Our organic growth strategy also includes cross marketing initiatives to sell credit and debit card processing services to JetPay HR & Payroll Services' payroll customers and payroll processing services to JetPay Payment Services' credit and debit card processing customers. Additionally, we will be seeking additional debt and/or equity capital to acquire additional credit and debit card processors, ISVs, ISOs and/or payroll processors to integrate into our JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services operations. Our acquisition strategy is focused on identifying small to medium-sized companies that either provide services similar to ours or services that expand our product and service offerings and/or our geographic reach. Both our JetPay Payment Services and our JetPay HR & Payroll Services operations have significant under-utilized processing capacity, which can be leveraged to create additional processing revenues without significant cost increases. Our overall strategy also includes looking for cost synergies as we continue to integrate the JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services operations in such areas as insurance costs, banking costs, employee benefit costs, and other selling, general and administrative cost as well as operating cost areas.\nJetPay Payment Services Segment\nRevenues\nJetPay Payments, TX and JetPay Payments, PA's revenues fall into two categories: transaction processing revenues and merchant discount revenues. As such, our two primary drivers are the number of transactions and merchant dollar volume. A third measure related to merchant dollar volume, for those merchants where we charge a percentage of the sale amount, is the average size of the transaction, as costs for processing the transaction tend to be fixed, so that the higher the average ticket, the more revenue we earn for a fixed cost. JetPay's discount revenues are generally a fixed percentage of the merchant's dollar volume, with interchange and other third-party fees passed through to the merchant without markup. Our billings to merchants primarily consist of these transaction fees and discount fees, as well as pass-through fees for other miscellaneous services, such as handling chargebacks. Interchange costs are set by the card networks, and are paid directly by the sponsoring bank to the credit card associations based upon a percentage of transaction amounts and/or a fixed price per transaction. JetPay Payment Services refers to the ratio of processing revenues to the dollar amount of card transactions processed as the margin.\u201d If margin increases, processing revenues will tend to increase accordingly. Further, both the number of merchants who process transactions, and the average dollar amount of transactions processed per merchant, will impact the total transaction volume and thus the total processing revenues. As such, growth in JetPay's merchant count and/or growth in the same store transaction volume will also drive JetPay's processing revenue growth.\n 28 \nJetPay Payments, FL generates substantially all of its revenues from transaction fees for processing a payment transaction. For credit card transactions, our fee may be charged as a fixed fee or as a percentage of the dollars processed. As such, the two primary factors affecting our processing revenue from accepting and processing credit card payments are the number of transactions and the average dollar volume of the transaction. Accordingly, growth in JetPay Payments, FL's client count and growth in the same client\u201d transaction dollar volume impact JetPay Payments FL's processing revenue growth. In the case of e-check (ACH) payments, typically our fees are charged as a fixed fee per transaction regardless of the payment amount.\nExpenses\nThe most significant components of operating expenses are credit card association fees and assessments; residual payments to ISOs / VARs / ISVs, strategic partners, and financial institutions; and salaries and other employment costs. Salaries and other employment costs are largely fixed in nature, increasing slightly with the growth in numbers of customers, but tending to grow with inflation. Credit card fees and assessments and bank sponsorship costs are generally a percentage of card volume. Bank sponsorship costs and processing fees are largely based upon transaction counts and volumes. Selling, general and administrative expenses include stable costs such as occupancy and office costs, outside services, and depreciation and amortization expense, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Cost of processing revenues also includes chargeback losses, which vary over the long term based upon transaction volume processed by JetPay's merchants, but can vary from period to period depending upon specific events in that period. JetPay Payment Services has experienced higher than normal professional fees due to the Direct Air matter.\nMerchant Attrition\nMerchant attrition is a normal part of the merchant processing industry in the ordinary course of business. JetPay Payment Services does not experience attrition in the same form as most of its competitors. Most of JetPay Payment Services' competitors have large portfolios of small businesses and these businesses change their payments provider quickly and for many reasons. JetPay Payment Services' portfolio is made up of small to large businesses and they are more cautious in making changes to payment providers, and therefore, its portfolio is not as volatile. However, due to the volume that each of these merchants produce, when one leaves, it may have a significant impact on operating results. In addition, JetPay Payment Services provides processing services to several ISOs and financial institutions. While our volatility in terms of the change in number of merchants remains significant, we experience less volatility in revenues. JetPay Payment Services monitors its customer attrition for both numbers of merchants as well as merchant processing revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, in our traditional business, JetPay Payment Services' customer attrition was approximately 24.2%, or an approximate 2,169 merchant reduction from approximately 9,698 merchants existing at December 31, 2015. This reduction in merchants included one particular ISO customer whose attrition rate is high due to the nature of its business. This reduction was offset by the addition of approximately 2,032, or approximately 21.0%, new merchants, resulting in a net merchant attrition rate of approximately 3.1%. With respect to processing revenues, the lost merchants in 2016 represented a loss of approximately $2.4 million of annualized revenues, or approximately 5.9% of JetPay Payment Services' 2016 revenues of approximately $40.7 million.\nMarkets\nWe have defined four distinct segments within which JetPay Payment Services operates: (i) Integrated Software Vendors (ISVs), especially those that leverage the e-Commerce and Recurring Payments strengths of JetPay's technology platform, (ii) e-Commerce, including Card-Not-Present and recurring payments; (iii) government and utilities; and (iv) financial institutions and associations. JetPay also operates where we have strategic advantages due to technology, product, or relationships, including ISOs, VARs, and small businesses through cross-sell. For small businesses and financial institutions, JetPay Payment Services is the traditional provider of merchant services to businesses, and holds the contracts. With regard to the other three markets, JetPay Payment Services operates in two forms: (i) as a processor only where JetPay Payment Services recognizes revenue from the authorization, clearing, and settlement functions and does not participate in the discount revenue or risk of the merchant; and (ii) in a shared relationship, where JetPay Payment Services either owns the merchant contract outright or shares in the discount revenue of the merchant with an agent or ISO, and may assume or share risk. This market experienced strong growth in 2016 and JetPay Payment Services expects to significantly increase this revenue area as the operations group solidifies the product offering and execution. Our expansion in 2015 and 2016 was negatively affected by management's time being diverted to dealing with the Direct Air issue described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, as well as efforts devoted to our acquisition and integration of JetPay Payments, PA and JetPay Payments, FL. Sales and marketing began targeting new customers and customer segments in 2015 and 2016 and we anticipate such efforts will lead to continued revenue growth in 2017 and future years.\n 29 \nWithin our JetPay Payments, FL's operation, our focus is on government, utility, and not-for-profit entities. We identified these specific markets because, in our experience, these clients are experiencing a faster growth rate than the electronic payments industry in general, and tend to have a more favorable risk profile. We believe that clients in these markets provide us with growth not only from the initial acquisition of a client that may not have been previously accepting electronic payments or accepting only minimal electronic payments, but also additional growth as our client's customers learn of the ability to pay electronically as they increase their use and adoption of credit and debit card payments instead of check or cash payments.\nJetPay HR & Payroll Segment\nRevenues\nThe majority of revenues from JetPay HR & Payroll Services have traditionally been derived from its payroll processing operations, which includes the calculation, preparation, collection and delivery of employer payroll obligations and the production of internal accounting records and management reports, and from services provided for the preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns, including the collection and remittance of clients' payroll tax obligations. In 2016, JetPay Payroll and HR Services placed a significant emphasis on providing additional human capital management services that complement the core payroll and tax filing businesses, to include onboarding, time and attendance, compliance, and other services that are becoming increasingly important to employers with fifty (50) or more employees. JetPay anticipates that these revenues will become an increasingly important incremental source of revenues. JetPay HR & Payroll Services experiences increased revenues in the fourth and first calendar quarters due to additional employer annual tax filing requirements. Payroll Tax Filing Services ( PTFS\u201d) trust account earnings represent the interest earned on the funds held for clients trust balance. Trust fund earnings can fluctuate based on the amount held in the trust account as well as fluctuations in interest rates. Over the past two years, JetPay HR & Payroll Services has seen a significant increase in revenue from its human capital management, Affordable Care Act and time and attendance services.\nExpenses\nJetPay HR & Payroll Services' most significant cost of processing revenues is its payroll and related expenses, costs of third party service providers, and facility overhead costs. These costs are largely fixed in nature, increasing slightly with the growth in numbers of customers and payrolls processed, and except for payroll costs, tend to grow with inflation. JetPay HR & Payroll Services' selling, general, and administrative expenses include the costs of the administrative and sales staff, payroll delivery costs, outside services, rent, office expense, insurance, sales and marketing costs and professional services costs.\nCustomer Attrition\nCustomer attrition is a normal part of the payroll processing industry in the ordinary course of business. JetPay HR & Payroll Services' attrition generally comes in three forms - closure of a business, acquisition of a business wherein the payroll is transferred to the buyer, and loss of customers to competitors. As a result, JetPay HR & Payroll Services monitors its customer losses for both numbers of customers as well as customer revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, JetPay HR & Payroll Segment customer attrition was approximately 6.8%, or a 347 customer reduction from approximately 5,108 customers existing at December 31, 2015. This reduction was offset by the addition of approximately 470 new customers, or approximately 9.2% over the 5,108 customers existing at December 31, 2015, resulting in a net customer growth rate of approximately 2.4%. With respect to payroll processing revenues, the lost customers in 2016 represented a loss of approximately $92,500 of annualized revenues, or approximately 6.3% of JetPay HR & Payroll Services' 2015 processing revenues of approximately $14.6 million. The new customers that JetPay added in 2016 contributed to a net increase in processing revenues in 2016 of approximately $90,800 or 6.2% of 2016 revenues.\n 30 \nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 and\nThe following tables represent a comparison of the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\n\n 31 \nRevenues\nRevenues were $56.3 million and $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Overall revenues increased $13.0 million, or 30.0%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. Of the $56.3 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, $15.6 million, or 27.8%, was generated from our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment and $40.7 million, or 72.2%, from our JetPay Payment Services Segment. Of the $43.3 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, $14.7 million, or 33.9%, was generated from our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment and $28.6 million, or 66.1%, from our JetPay Payment Services Segment.\nJetPay Payment Services Segment's revenues increased $12.1 million, or 42.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. Revenues from our JetPay Payments, PA operation increased $1.0 million, or 13.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, our Texas based JetPay Payment Services operation's revenues increased $816,000, or 3.8%, prior to eliminating inter-company revenues associated with JetPay Payments, FL of $1.0 million, in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, and our JetPay Payments, FL operation provided $11.3 million of revenues. The most significant changes within our JetPay Payments, TX operation was an increase of $1.3 million in our third party business and an increase of $773,000 in direct merchant services revenues. These gains were offset by a decrease of $1.26 million in our processing and clearing business, due mainly to a change in one of our larger customers' business operations.\nJetPay HR & Payroll Segment's revenues increased $877,000, or 6.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable to net growth in volume of payroll and related payroll taxes processed in addition to revenues generated from several new HR services introduced in 2015. Growth in our new HR related services was approximately $693,000 or 109.0% of our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment's revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of Processing Revenues\nCost of revenues were $37.5 million, or 66.5% of revenues, and $26.2 million, or 60.5% of revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of the $37.5 million cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, $7.9 million, or 21%, related to our HR & Payroll Segment, and $29.5 million, or 79%, related to our Payment Services Segment. Of the $26.2 million of cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, $7.3 million, or 27.9%, related to our HR & Payroll Segment and $18.8 million, or 72.1%, related to our Payment Services Segment.\nThe cost of processing revenues within the Payment Services Segment increased from $18.8 million, or 65.7% of revenues in 2015 to $29.5 million, or 72.5% of revenues in 2016, an increase of $10.7 million, or 57.1%. The increase in cost of processing revenues was primarily related to the growth in our Payment Processing Segment revenues, including the acquisition of JetPay Payments, FL which provided $7.1 million of cost of processing revenues. Cost of processing revenues was also impacted by increased card association and other direct processing costs with an increase in back-end settlement volumes. Overall gross profit margin as reported within our Payment Services Segment decreased from 34.3% in 2015 to 27.5% in 2016 largely as a result of the decrease in higher-margin front-end processing only revenues and the increase in lower-margin third party ISO revenues, combined with the impact of lower margin JetPay Payments, FL revenues and the continued investments made in technology professionals.\nThe cost of processing revenues within our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment increased $525,000, increasing as a percentage of revenues from 49.8% in 2015 to 50.4% in 2016 principally due to the increase in HR related service revenues and the continued investment in technology, customer service professionals and new product management. The effect of this increase in costs of processing revenues as a percentage of revenues was a decrease in gross profit margin within our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment from 50.2% in 2015 to 49.6% in 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses were $16.9 million, or 30.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $13.3 million, or 30.7% of revenues, for the same period in 2015.\nSG&A expenses within the Payment Services Segment increased from $6.9 million or 24.0% of revenues in 2015, to $9.3 million, or 22.7% of revenues in 2016. This increase was largely the result of SG&A expenses related to JetPay Payments, FL of $2.4 million and the continued increase in sales staff and marketing costs to attract new business.\n 32 \nSG&A expenses within our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment increased from $4.8 million in 2015 to $5.4 million in 2016, an increase of approximately $608,000, or 12.7%, largely due to an increase in payroll costs as additional sales and technology professionals were added to help develop new products and services and execute our HCM revenue growth strategies.\nAdditionally, we incurred corporate SG&A expenses of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, including the benefit of $1.9 million of management fees received from the Company's operating divisions as compared to corporate SG&A expenses of $1.7 million in the same period of 2015, including $1.43 million of management fees received from the operating divisions. Corporate SG&A expenses include, but are not limited to, the salaries of our executive officers, outside professional fees, acquisition costs, investor relations and other public company costs, and general corporate operating expenses. Corporate SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $669,000 of transaction costs related to the JetPay Payments, FL acquisition. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $399,000 as compared to $278,000 in 2015. The SG&A expenses of our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment include $360,000 and $350,000 of corporate allocated costs in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the Payment Processing Segment includes $1.54 million and $1.08 million of corporate allocated costs in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with an offsetting reduction in corporate SG&A expenses of $1.9 million and $1.43 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nSettlement of Legal Matter\nSettlement of Legal Matter charge of $6.19 million reflects the Company's loss based on the terms of the Merrick Settlement Agreement and the WLES Settlement Agreement. The loss includes: (i) a charge of $4.4 million related to the Company's release of all claims to the $4.4 million held in reserve at Merrick; (ii) a charge of $1.4 million related to the Company's issuance of the $3.85MM Note, less WLES' agreement to transfer to Merrick the WLES Note (recorded at $2,036,511 at June 30, 2016 net of an unamortized discount of $294,858) and accrued interest on the WLES Note of $414,466; (iii) a charge of $50,000 representing the Company's issuance of the $5.0MM Note, less the estimated value as of July 26, 2016 of the escrowed shares; and (iv) a charge for $373,334 representing the fair market value of the issuance of warrants to WLES on February 15, 2017 as described in the WLES Settlement Agreement.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization totaled $4.0 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily related to increased depreciation expense on 2016 capital expenditures and the amortization of the JetPay Payments, FL's intangible assets acquired on June 2, 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.2 million and $819,000, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2016 was primarily related to interest payments on the Fifth Third Bank term note issued on June 2, 2016 in connection with our acquisition of JetPay Payments, FL and the Notes issued to Merrick on July 26, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded income tax (benefit) expense of $(1.43) million and $197,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income tax expense reflects the recording of state income taxes. The effective tax rates were approximately (14.8)% and (19.7)% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year, primarily due to state and local income taxes and changes to the valuation allowance. Additionally, with the acquisition of JetPay Payments, FL and its related identifiable intangible and fixed assets, management recorded an associated $1.86 million deferred tax liability. Management believed that it was more likely than not that the benefit of a portion of its federal net deferred tax assets would be realized equal to the future source of income created by the amortization of the JetPay Payments, FL identifiable intangible and fixed asset assets, and accordingly, recorded a partial reduction of the valuation allowance against its federal deferred tax assets of $1.6 million.\nAnalysis of Impairment\nThe Company conducts its annual goodwill impairment testing as of December 31 of each year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We performed extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market approaches, in our goodwill assessment process for our two identified reporting units that contained goodwill, JetPay Payment Processing and JetPay HR & Payroll reporting segments.\n 33 \nIn our income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) analysis for each of our previously identified reporting units using discount rates of 16.5% for both our JetPay Payment Processing and JetPay HR & Payroll reporting segments, which represent the estimated weighted average cost of capital. These discount rates reflect the overall level of inherent risk involved in our reporting units and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In our DCF analysis, we prepared a five year forecast of our expected earnings to derive an expected stream of free cash flow through December 31, 2021. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our forecast, we used a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we estimated operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model, adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth assumption and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value. In developing our forecasts of revenues and direct variable operating expenses, we utilized a variety of factors including our current and anticipated sales pipelines of prospects currently known to us, as well as those which we believe will be generated through current and future relationships with merchants, agent banks and ISOs. We also applied our knowledge of the industries, general economic conditions, and the forecast of industry experts regarding consumers' continued trending towards expanded use of electronic payment methods. Our operating expenses are either variable with revenues, or fixed and predictable; however, we increased our future costs based on expected inflation and the need to expand personnel costs as we achieve projected future revenue levels. In performing our DCF analysis, we multiplied our estimated cash flows by a marginal federal and state tax rate of 40% to derive our after-tax cash flows, and we utilized weighted average costs of capital of 16.5% for both our JetPay Payment Processing reporting segment and JetPay HR & Payroll reporting segment analysis. In addition to the income approach, we also used several market-based approaches to corroborate the results of the income approach described above; including comparing our company's various earnings and performance indicators to those of similar publicly traded companies, comparisons to prior purchase and sales transactions of similar reporting units by companies, and a comparison to recent mergers and acquisitions of guideline companies.\nWith respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our JetPay Payment Processing reporting segment, as of December 31, 2016, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit was $69.8 million which exceeded the carrying value of net assets by $21.4 million, or 44.2%. With respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our JetPay HR & Payroll reporting segment, as of December 31, 2016, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit was $39.5 million which exceeded the carrying value of net assets by $13.5 million, or 51.9%. Events or circumstances that could have a negative effect on estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future include, but are not limited to, a loss of customers due to competition, pressure from our customers to reduce pricing, inability to continue to employ a competent workforce at current rates of pay, changes in government regulations, and accelerating costs beyond management's control.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents were $12.6 million at December 31, 2016, excluding $2.1 million of cash deposited into restricted cash accounts. The ratio of our total debt to total capitalization, which consists of total debt, convertible preferred stock, and stockholders' equity, was 25% and 23% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had working capital, excluding funds held for clients and client funds obligations, of approximately $5.0 million.\nWe expect to fund our cash needs, including capital required for acquisitions, with cash flow from our operating activities, sales of equity securities and borrowings. Additionally, we will require approximately $5.2 million, after giving effect to the payoff of a $5.0 million promissory note payable to Merrick Bank Corporation on January 11, 2017, See Note 17. Subsequent Events in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, to cover our interest and principal payments on our existing debt for the fifteen months ending March 31, 2018, capital expenditures of $3.9 million; and $314,000 of deferred consideration paid to the unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA on January 17, 2017. We expect to fund our cash needs for the next fifteen months, including debt service requirements, capital expenditures and possible future acquisitions, with cash flow from its operating activities, sales of equity securities (including the recent sale of preferred stock and borrowings, see below) and through new borrowings. As disclosed in Note 11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, from October 11, 2013 to October 18, 2016, we sold 99,666 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series A Preferred\u201d), to Flexpoint for an aggregate of $29.9 million, less certain costs. Additionally, on October 18, 2016, we sold 33,667 shares of Series A Preferred to Sundara for $10.1 million, less certain costs. In connection with the sale of shares of Series A Preferred to Sundara, we also entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with an affiliate of Sundara, LHLJ, Inc., for a term loan in the principal amount of $9.5 million, with $5.175 million of the proceeds used to simultaneously satisfy the remaining balances of a term loan and a revolving credit note payable to First National Bank of Pennsylvania (f/k/a Metro Bank) ( FNB\u201d) (the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Services Credit Facility\u201d). See Note 10. Long-Term debt, Note Payable and Capital Lease Obligations. Both Sundara and LHLJ are owned and controlled by Laurence L. Stone, who was appointed as a director of the Company pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated Series A Purchase Agreement. These two transactions provided approximately $14.0 million of net working capital which we used and expect to use for general working capital needs, the payment of other debt instruments, and for future capital needs, including a portion of the cost of potential future acquisitions. Finally, from May 5, 2014 to December 31, 2014, we sold 6,165 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series A-1 Preferred\u201d), to affiliates of Wellington Capital Management, LLP ( Wellington\u201d) for an aggregate of $1.85 million. Additionally, as disclosed in Note 12. Stockholders' Equity, from December 22, 2015 to January 22, 2016, we sold to certain accredited investors, including Bipin C. Shah, Robert B. Palmer, and Jonathan M. Lubert, an aggregate of 517,037 shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $2.70 per share for aggregate consideration of $1,396,000, prior to issuance costs.\n 34 \nCapital expenditures were $819,000 and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We currently estimate capital expenditures for all of our ongoing operations, including JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services, at approximately $3.0 million to $3.9 million for 2017, principally related to technology improvements and the implementation of major new customer contracts. Our capital requirements include working capital for daily operations, including expenditures to maintain and upgrade our technology platforms. Our operations currently generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our current operating needs and our routine debt service requirements.\nIn the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing by obtaining loans and selling shares of our equity securities, including the sale of shares Series A Preferred to Flexpoint and Sundara and the sale of shares of Series A-1 Preferred to Wellington. To fund and integrate future acquisitions or expand our technology platforms for new business initiatives, we will need to raise additional capital through loans, the sale of Series A-1 Preferred, or other sales of equity securities. In addition, we continue to investigate the capital markets for sources of funding, which could take the form of additional debt or equity financing. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in securing new financing or restructuring our current debt, or that we will secure such future financing with commercially acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may need to delay certain technology capital improvements, limit our planned level of capital expenditures and future growth plans or dispose of operating assets to generate cash to sustain operations and fund ongoing capital investments.\nDebt Capitalization and Other Financing Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2016, we had borrowings of approximately $21.9 million net of an unamortized deferred financing costs of $339,000.\nOn December 28, 2012, JetPay HR & Payroll Services and PTFS, as borrowers, entered into the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Credit Facility with FNB as the lender for a term loan with a principal amount of $9,000,000. Amounts outstanding under the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Credit Facility accrued interest at a rate of 4% per annum. The loan was schedule to mature on December 28, 2019, but was paid in full in October 2016, in connection with the LHLJ, Inc. ( LHLJ\u201d) loan.\nIn connection with the closing of our acquisitions of JetPay Payments, TX and JetPay HR & Payroll Services, we entered into a Note and Indemnity Side Agreement. Pursuant to the Note and Indemnity Side Agreement, we agreed to issue the WLES Note. Interest accrued on amounts due under the WLES Note at a rate of 5% per annum. Under the terms of the WLES Settlement Agreement, WLES transferred the WLES Note to Merrick on July 26, 2016. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies.\nOn November 7, 2014, pursuant to a Unit Purchase Agreement by and between the Company, JetPay Payments, PA and Michael Collester and Cathy Smith, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of JetPay Payments, PA for an aggregate of $11.0 million in cash and the issuance of 2.0 million shares of its common stock to the unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA with a value of approximately $3.7 million on the date of acquisition. The previous unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA were entitled to receive additional cash consideration of $2.4 million, $1.2 million of which was paid on April 10, 2015 and $1.2 million of which was paid on April 10, 2016, and were entitled to earn up to an additional $500,000 based on the net revenues of JetPay Payments, PA for the twelve month periods ended October 31, 2015 and 2016, of which $186,000 was paid to the previous unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA in February 2016 and $314,000 on January 17, 2017, satisfying this obligation in full. In order to finance a portion of the proceeds paid to the previous unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA, JetPay Payments, PA, as borrower, and the Company and JetPay HR & Payroll Services, as guarantors, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement on November 7, 2014 with FNB with a principal amount of $7.5 million (as amended, the JetPay Payments, PA Credit Facility\u201d). Amounts outstanding under the loan accrue interest at a rate of 5.25% per annum. The loan matures on November 6, 2021 and amortizes in equal monthly installments of $104,167. The principal balance of this term loan was $6.04 million at December 31, 2016. Additional principal payments may be required at the end of each fiscal year based on a free cash flow calculation set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement.\n 35 \nOn May 6, 2015, JetPay HR & Payroll Services and PTFS, as borrowers, along with the Company, JetPay Payments, PA, and JetPay, Payments, TX, collectively as loan parties, entered into a First Amendment and Joinder Agreement to the Loan and Security Agreement dated December 28, 2012 and a Revolving Credit Note (the Revolving Note\u201d) dated May 6, 2015 with FNB, as the lender. The Revolving Note provided a $1.0 million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on May 6, 2017 and accrued interest at the rate of the Wall Street Journal Prime rate plus 1.00%, with a floor of 4.25%. On May 6, 2015, the proceeds of the $1.0 million Revolving Note, along with $650,000 of current cash and cash equivalents, were used to partially fund a $2.0 million deferred consideration liability due to the stockholders of ADC. The Revolving Note was paid in full on October 18, 2016.\nOn January 15, 2016, we issued promissory notes to each of Messrs. Shah and Lubert, and Flexpoint. The promissory notes each had an interest rate of 12% per annum and were scheduled to mature on April 14, 2016. The $1.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the promissory notes was used as cash collateral recorded as restricted cash to replace a $1.9 million letter of credit in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. On April 11, 2016, the Company entered into letter agreements with each of Messrs. Shah and Lubert, and Flexpoint to extend until July 31, 2016 the maturity dates of the Promissory Notes. On July 26, 2016, Jonathan Lubert and Flexpoint agreed to further extend their promissory notes to September 30, 2016.

On September 30, 2016, Jonathan Lubert and Flexpoint extended the term of their promissory notes to October 31, 2016. Each of the he promissory notes were repaid on October 21, 2016. We are currently working with several financial institutions to secure a $1.9 million letter of credit at which time the restricted cash reserves would be released to the Company. There can be no assurance that a letter of credit will be obtained or obtained on reasonable terms.\nOn June 2, 2016, in connection with the closing of the JetPay Payments, FL acquisition, JetPay Payments, FL and the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Fifth Third Bank. In connection with the Credit Agreement, JetPay Payments, FL issued in favor of Fifth Third Bank a term note with a principal amount of $1,068,960 and a $500,000 revolving note to refinance certain credit arrangements of JetPay Payments, FL in place at another financial institution prior to the closing of the transaction. The term note matures on November 30, 2019 and bears interest at 4.00%. The revolving note matures on June 2, 2017 and the bears interest at a rate of 2.00% plus the LIBOR Rate for the applicable interest period. The term note and the revolving note are secured by the assets of JetPay Payments, FL and guaranteed by JetPay. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants, including a financial covenant related to JetPay Payments, FL's fixed charge coverage ratio, which the Company was in compliance as of December 31, 2016.\nOn July 26, 2016, as part of the Merrick Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to issue in favor of Merrick the $3.85MM Note and the $5.00MM Note. The Notes were secured by the 3,333,333 shares of JetPay's common stock issued in the name of WLES and held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (described above). The $3.85MM Note was satisfied in full on October 21, 2016 and the $5.00MM Note was satisfied in full on January 11, 2017.\nOn October 18, 2016, JetPay HR & Payroll Services and PTFS, as borrowers, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement\u201d) with LHLJ, Inc., a Delaware corporation controlled by Laurence L. Stone, as lender, for a term loan in the principal amount of $9.5 million (the LHLJ Debt Investment\u201d). The underlying promissory note bears interest at 8%. The loan matures on October 18, 2021 and is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of $128,677 with a final payment of $4.75 million at maturity. The obligations of the borrowers under the Loan Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and JetPay Payments, FL, and are secured by all of the assets of JetPay HR & Payroll Services, PTFS and JetPay Payments, FL, as well as a pledge by the Company of its ownership interests in JetPay HR & Payroll Services, PTFS and JetPay Payments, FL. The Loan Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates and other customary restrictions for loans of this type and size. The borrowers are also subject to financial covenants relating to their debt coverage ratio and total leverage ratio during the term of the loan. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2016. The principal balance of this term loan was $9.37 million at December 31, 2016.\nA portion of the proceeds of the LHLJ Debt Investment was used to simultaneously satisfy the remaining balance of $4.175 million outstanding under the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Services Credit Facility. In connection with the satisfaction of the Borrowers' obligations under the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Services Credit Facility, JetPay Payments, PA, JetPay HR & Payroll Services, the Company and FNB entered into an amendment to the JetPay Payments, PA Credit Facility to release JetPay HR & Payroll Service's guaranty of the obligations of JetPay Payments, PA under the JetPay Payments, PA Credit Facility and to eliminate provisions relating to the cross-collateralization of the JetPay Payments, PA Credit Facility and the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Services Credit Facility.\n 36 \nOur ongoing ability to comply with the debt covenants under our credit arrangements and to refinance our debt depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of cash flow. If our future cash flows are less than expected or our debt service, including interest expense, increases more than expected, causing us to default on any of the loan covenants in the future, we will need to obtain amendments or waivers from the applicable lender. In the event that non-compliance with the debt covenants should occur in the future, we would pursue various alternatives in an attempt to successfully resolve the non-compliance, which might include, among other things, seeking additional debt covenant waivers or amendments or refinancing debt with other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that debt covenant waivers or amendments would be obtained, if needed, or that the debt could be refinanced with other financial institutions on favorable terms.\nAdditionally, in connection with the December 2012 $9.0 million term loan, the November 2014 $7.5 million term loan, and the May 2015 Revolving Note, all payable to FNB, we incurred $23,000, $76,000, and $40,000 of deferred financing costs, respectively. Finally, we incurred (i) $95,000 of deferred financing fees related to the issuance of the Promissory Notes and (ii) $16,600 of deferred financing fees related to JetPay Payments, FL's term note and revolving note, each in favor of Fifth Third Bank, and $310,000 of deferred financing fees related to the LHLJ, Inc. Loan Agreement. Unamortized deferred financing costs were $339,000 at December 31, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016 consisted of an outstanding letter of credit of $100,000 which represents collateral with respect to a front-end processing relationship with a credit card company.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are obligated under various operating leases, primarily for office space and certain equipment related to our operations. Certain of these leases contain purchase options, renewal provisions, and contingent rentals for our proportionate share of taxes, utilities, insurance, and annual cost of living increases.\nThe following are summaries of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at December 31, 2016, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs (in thousands):\n\n\n (1) Related interest obligations have been excluded from this maturity schedule. Our interest payments for the next twelve month period, based on current market rates, are expected to be approximately $1.3 million. \n (2) Outstanding letter of credit of $100,000 which represents collateral with respect to a front-end processing relationship with a credit card company. \n 37 \nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash provided by operating activities in this period was primarily due to a net loss of $8.2 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $1.0 million, and an increase in deferred income tax liability of $1.6 million, all offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization relating to fixed assets, intangible assets, non-cash interest costs and debt discounts of $4.3 million, stock based compensation expenses of $446,000, recognition of a note payable in connection with the settlement of a legal matter of $1.85 million, a decrease in other assets of $4.1 million, a net decrease in settlement processing assets and liabilities of $1.4 million, and an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities of $233,000.\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities in this period was primarily due to a net loss of $1.2 million, offset by non-cash amortization relating to intangible assets, non-cash interest costs and debt discounts and conversion options, and depreciation and amortization expense totaling $3.9 million, and a decrease in restricted cash of $1.2 million. This increase in cash was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $357,000, and an increase in accounts receivable of $489,000.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, including purchases of property and equipment of $716,000, an investment in acquired JetPay Payments, FL technology of $623,000 and an increase of $819,000 in restricted cash and equivalents held to satisfy client obligations, all partially offset by cash acquired in the JetPay Payments, FL acquisition of $520,000.\nCash used in investing activities totaled $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, is primarily due to an increase of $7.5 million in restricted cash and equivalents held to satisfy client obligations and the purchase of property and equipment of $875,000.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which included proceeds from issuance of promissory notes of $11.5 million, proceeds from the sale of preferred stock, net of issuance costs, of $12.4 million, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $47,000, and proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs, of $64,000,and an increase of $819,000 in client fund obligations, all partially offset by $14.0 million of cash used for payments on long-term debt, an increase in restricted cash reserves of $1.9 million, payment of deferred and contingent acquisition consideration of $1.4 million, and payment of deferred financing fees associated with new borrowings of $421,000.\nCash provided by financing activities totaled $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which included an increase of $7.5 million in client fund obligations, proceeds from a revolving credit facility of $1.0 million, and $1.3 million from the sale of common stock, all partially offset by $1.6 million of cash used for payments on long-term debt and the payment of $2.85 million of deferred acquisition consideration.\nSeasonality\nJetPay Payments, TX's and JetPay Payments, PA's revenues and earnings are impacted by the volume of consumer usage of credit and debit cards. For example, JetPay Payment Services experiences increased purchase activity during the first and second quarters due to seasonal volumes of some merchants in JetPay Payment Services' portfolio. Revenues during the first and second quarters tend to increase in comparison to the remaining two quarters of JetPay Payment Services' fiscal year on a same store basis.\nJetPay Payments, FL's expects increased revenues during the first and fourth quarters due to seasonal volumes of certain government and utility clients and their billing cycles.\nJetPay HR & Payroll Services' revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned. JetPay HR & Payroll Services experiences increased revenues during the fourth and first quarters due to the processing of additional year-end tax filing requirements. Accordingly, revenues and earnings are greater in the fourth and first quarter in comparison to the remaining two quarters of JetPay HR & Payroll Services' fiscal year.\n 38 \nEffects of Inflation\nJetPay Payment Services' and JetPay HR & Payroll Services' monetary assets, consisting primarily of cash and receivables, are not significantly affected by inflation. Non-monetary assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, are not affected by inflation. We believe that replacement costs of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and other operating expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us. The rate of inflation can also affect our revenues by affecting our client's payroll processing volumes and our merchant charge volume and corresponding changes to processing revenues. While these can be positive or negative, since a portion of JetPay Payment Services' revenues are derived as a percentage of dollar volume processed, JetPay Payment Services' revenues will generally rise when inflation rises. Additionally, JetPay HR & Payroll Services' revenues include the interest earned on the funds held for clients investment trust account balance. Trust fund earnings can fluctuate based on the amount held in the trust account as well as fluctuations in interest rates.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company's critical accounting policies are described below.\nUse of Estimates\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion also contains forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on November 12, 2010 as a blank check company to serve as a vehicle to acquire through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more operating businesses. As previously disclosed, we completed the acquisitions of JetPay Payments, TX (f/k/a JetPay, LLC) and JetPay HR & Payroll (f/k/a A. D. Computer Corporation), on December 28, 2012, JetPay Payments, PA (f/k/a ACI Merchant Systems, LLC) on November 7, 2014, and JetPay Payments, FL (f/k/a CollectorSolutions, Inc.) on June 2, 2016.\nWe are a provider of payment services - debit and credit card processing, payroll and HCM services, and prepaid card services to businesses and their employees throughout the United States. We provide these services through four wholly-owned subsidiaries: JetPay Payments, TX, which provides debit and credit card processing and ACH payment services to businesses with a focus on those processing internet transactions and recurring billings; JetPay Payments, PA, an independent sales organization specializing in relationships with banks, credit unions, other financial institutions and strategic partners; JetPay Payments, FL, a debit and credit card processor specializing in providing services to government agencies and utilities; and JetPay HR & Payroll Services, which provides HCM services, including, payroll, tax filing, time and attendance, HR services, and Affordable Care Act and related services to small and medium-sized employers. We also provide prepaid card services within our HR & Payroll Services Segment.\nOur overall business strategy is to provide payment processing services to small to large-sized businesses with a high percentage of our revenues consisting of recurring revenues with strong margins and with relatively low capital requirements. Our corporate strategy is to increase our revenues through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Our organic growth strategy is focused on developing and increasing our current marketing and sales staff at JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services to penetrate new customer niches and geographic markets. Our organic growth strategy also includes cross marketing initiatives to sell credit and debit card processing services to JetPay HR & Payroll Services' payroll customers and payroll processing services to JetPay Payment Services' credit and debit card processing customers. Additionally, we will be seeking additional debt and/or equity capital to acquire additional credit and debit card processors, ISVs, ISOs and/or payroll processors to integrate into our JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services operations. Our acquisition strategy is focused on identifying small to medium-sized companies that either provide services similar to ours or services that expand our product and service offerings and/or our geographic reach. Both our JetPay Payment Services and our JetPay HR & Payroll Services operations have significant under-utilized processing capacity, which can be leveraged to create additional processing revenues without significant cost increases. Our overall strategy also includes looking for cost synergies as we continue to integrate the JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services operations in such areas as insurance costs, banking costs, employee benefit costs, and other selling, general and administrative cost as well as operating cost areas.\nJetPay Payment Services Segment\nRevenues\nJetPay Payments, TX and JetPay Payments, PA's revenues fall into two categories: transaction processing revenues and merchant discount revenues. As such, our two primary drivers are the number of transactions and merchant dollar volume. A third measure related to merchant dollar volume, for those merchants where we charge a percentage of the sale amount, is the average size of the transaction, as costs for processing the transaction tend to be fixed, so that the higher the average ticket, the more revenue we earn for a fixed cost. JetPay's discount revenues are generally a fixed percentage of the merchant's dollar volume, with interchange and other third-party fees passed through to the merchant without markup. Our billings to merchants primarily consist of these transaction fees and discount fees, as well as pass-through fees for other miscellaneous services, such as handling chargebacks. Interchange costs are set by the card networks, and are paid directly by the sponsoring bank to the credit card associations based upon a percentage of transaction amounts and/or a fixed price per transaction. JetPay Payment Services refers to the ratio of processing revenues to the dollar amount of card transactions processed as the margin.\u201d If margin increases, processing revenues will tend to increase accordingly. Further, both the number of merchants who process transactions, and the average dollar amount of transactions processed per merchant, will impact the total transaction volume and thus the total processing revenues. As such, growth in JetPay's merchant count and/or growth in the same store transaction volume will also drive JetPay's processing revenue growth.\n 28 \nJetPay Payments, FL generates substantially all of its revenues from transaction fees for processing a payment transaction. For credit card transactions, our fee may be charged as a fixed fee or as a percentage of the dollars processed. As such, the two primary factors affecting our processing revenue from accepting and processing credit card payments are the number of transactions and the average dollar volume of the transaction. Accordingly, growth in JetPay Payments, FL's client count and growth in the same client\u201d transaction dollar volume impact JetPay Payments FL's processing revenue growth. In the case of e-check (ACH) payments, typically our fees are charged as a fixed fee per transaction regardless of the payment amount.\nExpenses\nThe most significant components of operating expenses are credit card association fees and assessments; residual payments to ISOs / VARs / ISVs, strategic partners, and financial institutions; and salaries and other employment costs. Salaries and other employment costs are largely fixed in nature, increasing slightly with the growth in numbers of customers, but tending to grow with inflation. Credit card fees and assessments and bank sponsorship costs are generally a percentage of card volume. Bank sponsorship costs and processing fees are largely based upon transaction counts and volumes. Selling, general and administrative expenses include stable costs such as occupancy and office costs, outside services, and depreciation and amortization expense, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Cost of processing revenues also includes chargeback losses, which vary over the long term based upon transaction volume processed by JetPay's merchants, but can vary from period to period depending upon specific events in that period. JetPay Payment Services has experienced higher than normal professional fees due to the Direct Air matter.\nMerchant Attrition\nMerchant attrition is a normal part of the merchant processing industry in the ordinary course of business. JetPay Payment Services does not experience attrition in the same form as most of its competitors. Most of JetPay Payment Services' competitors have large portfolios of small businesses and these businesses change their payments provider quickly and for many reasons. JetPay Payment Services' portfolio is made up of small to large businesses and they are more cautious in making changes to payment providers, and therefore, its portfolio is not as volatile. However, due to the volume that each of these merchants produce, when one leaves, it may have a significant impact on operating results. In addition, JetPay Payment Services provides processing services to several ISOs and financial institutions. While our volatility in terms of the change in number of merchants remains significant, we experience less volatility in revenues. JetPay Payment Services monitors its customer attrition for both numbers of merchants as well as merchant processing revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, in our traditional business, JetPay Payment Services' customer attrition was approximately 24.2%, or an approximate 2,169 merchant reduction from approximately 9,698 merchants existing at December 31, 2015. This reduction in merchants included one particular ISO customer whose attrition rate is high due to the nature of its business. This reduction was offset by the addition of approximately 2,032, or approximately 21.0%, new merchants, resulting in a net merchant attrition rate of approximately 3.1%. With respect to processing revenues, the lost merchants in 2016 represented a loss of approximately $2.4 million of annualized revenues, or approximately 5.9% of JetPay Payment Services' 2016 revenues of approximately $40.7 million.\nMarkets\nWe have defined four distinct segments within which JetPay Payment Services operates: (i) Integrated Software Vendors (ISVs), especially those that leverage the e-Commerce and Recurring Payments strengths of JetPay's technology platform, (ii) e-Commerce, including Card-Not-Present and recurring payments; (iii) government and utilities; and (iv) financial institutions and associations. JetPay also operates where we have strategic advantages due to technology, product, or relationships, including ISOs, VARs, and small businesses through cross-sell. For small businesses and financial institutions, JetPay Payment Services is the traditional provider of merchant services to businesses, and holds the contracts. With regard to the other three markets, JetPay Payment Services operates in two forms: (i) as a processor only where JetPay Payment Services recognizes revenue from the authorization, clearing, and settlement functions and does not participate in the discount revenue or risk of the merchant; and (ii) in a shared relationship, where JetPay Payment Services either owns the merchant contract outright or shares in the discount revenue of the merchant with an agent or ISO, and may assume or share risk. This market experienced strong growth in 2016 and JetPay Payment Services expects to significantly increase this revenue area as the operations group solidifies the product offering and execution. Our expansion in 2015 and 2016 was negatively affected by management's time being diverted to dealing with the Direct Air issue described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, as well as efforts devoted to our acquisition and integration of JetPay Payments, PA and JetPay Payments, FL. Sales and marketing began targeting new customers and customer segments in 2015 and 2016 and we anticipate such efforts will lead to continued revenue growth in 2017 and future years.\n 29 \nWithin our JetPay Payments, FL's operation, our focus is on government, utility, and not-for-profit entities. We identified these specific markets because, in our experience, these clients are experiencing a faster growth rate than the electronic payments industry in general, and tend to have a more favorable risk profile. We believe that clients in these markets provide us with growth not only from the initial acquisition of a client that may not have been previously accepting electronic payments or accepting only minimal electronic payments, but also additional growth as our client's customers learn of the ability to pay electronically as they increase their use and adoption of credit and debit card payments instead of check or cash payments.\nJetPay HR & Payroll Segment\nRevenues\nThe majority of revenues from JetPay HR & Payroll Services have traditionally been derived from its payroll processing operations, which includes the calculation, preparation, collection and delivery of employer payroll obligations and the production of internal accounting records and management reports, and from services provided for the preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns, including the collection and remittance of clients' payroll tax obligations. In 2016, JetPay Payroll and HR Services placed a significant emphasis on providing additional human capital management services that complement the core payroll and tax filing businesses, to include onboarding, time and attendance, compliance, and other services that are becoming increasingly important to employers with fifty (50) or more employees. JetPay anticipates that these revenues will become an increasingly important incremental source of revenues. JetPay HR & Payroll Services experiences increased revenues in the fourth and first calendar quarters due to additional employer annual tax filing requirements. Payroll Tax Filing Services ( PTFS\u201d) trust account earnings represent the interest earned on the funds held for clients trust balance. Trust fund earnings can fluctuate based on the amount held in the trust account as well as fluctuations in interest rates. Over the past two years, JetPay HR & Payroll Services has seen a significant increase in revenue from its human capital management, Affordable Care Act and time and attendance services.\nExpenses\nJetPay HR & Payroll Services' most significant cost of processing revenues is its payroll and related expenses, costs of third party service providers, and facility overhead costs. These costs are largely fixed in nature, increasing slightly with the growth in numbers of customers and payrolls processed, and except for payroll costs, tend to grow with inflation. JetPay HR & Payroll Services' selling, general, and administrative expenses include the costs of the administrative and sales staff, payroll delivery costs, outside services, rent, office expense, insurance, sales and marketing costs and professional services costs.\nCustomer Attrition\nCustomer attrition is a normal part of the payroll processing industry in the ordinary course of business. JetPay HR & Payroll Services' attrition generally comes in three forms - closure of a business, acquisition of a business wherein the payroll is transferred to the buyer, and loss of customers to competitors. As a result, JetPay HR & Payroll Services monitors its customer losses for both numbers of customers as well as customer revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, JetPay HR & Payroll Segment customer attrition was approximately 6.8%, or a 347 customer reduction from approximately 5,108 customers existing at December 31, 2015. This reduction was offset by the addition of approximately 470 new customers, or approximately 9.2% over the 5,108 customers existing at December 31, 2015, resulting in a net customer growth rate of approximately 2.4%. With respect to payroll processing revenues, the lost customers in 2016 represented a loss of approximately $92,500 of annualized revenues, or approximately 6.3% of JetPay HR & Payroll Services' 2015 processing revenues of approximately $14.6 million. The new customers that JetPay added in 2016 contributed to a net increase in processing revenues in 2016 of approximately $90,800 or 6.2% of 2016 revenues.\n 30 \nResults of Operations for the Year

\nRevenues\nRevenues were $56.3 million and $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Overall revenues increased $13.0 million, or 30.0%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. Of the $56.3 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, $15.6 million, or 27.8%, was generated from our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment and $40.7 million, or 72.2%, from our JetPay Payment Services Segment. Of the $43.3 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, $14.7 million, or 33.9%, was generated from our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment and $28.6 million, or 66.1%, from our JetPay Payment Services Segment.\nJetPay Payment Services Segment's revenues increased $12.1 million, or 42.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. Revenues from our JetPay Payments, PA operation increased $1.0 million, or 13.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, our Texas based JetPay Payment Services operation's revenues increased $816,000, or 3.8%, prior to eliminating inter-company revenues associated with JetPay Payments, FL of $1.0 million, in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, and our JetPay Payments, FL operation provided $11.3 million of revenues. The most significant changes within our JetPay Payments, TX operation was an increase of $1.3 million in our third party business and an increase of $773,000 in direct merchant services revenues. These gains were offset by a decrease of $1.26 million in our processing and clearing business, due mainly to a change in one of our larger customers' business operations.\nJetPay HR & Payroll Segment's revenues increased $877,000, or 6.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable to net growth in volume of payroll and related payroll taxes processed in addition to revenues generated from several new HR services introduced in 2015. Growth in our new HR related services was approximately $693,000 or 109.0% of our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment's revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of Processing Revenues\nCost of revenues were $37.5 million, or 66.5% of revenues, and $26.2 million, or 60.5% of revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of the $37.5 million cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, $7.9 million, or 21%, related to our HR & Payroll Segment, and $29.5 million, or 79%, related to our Payment Services Segment. Of the $26.2 million of cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, $7.3 million, or 27.9%, related to our HR & Payroll Segment and $18.8 million, or 72.1%, related to our Payment Services Segment.\nThe cost of processing revenues within the Payment Services Segment increased from $18.8 million, or 65.7% of revenues in 2015 to $29.5 million, or 72.5% of revenues in 2016, an increase of $10.7 million, or 57.1%. The increase in cost of processing revenues was primarily related to the growth in our Payment Processing Segment revenues, including the acquisition of JetPay Payments, FL which provided $7.1 million of cost of processing revenues. Cost of processing revenues was also impacted by increased card association and other direct processing costs with an increase in back-end settlement volumes. Overall gross profit margin as reported within our Payment Services Segment decreased from 34.3% in 2015 to 27.5% in 2016 largely as a result of the decrease in higher-margin front-end processing only revenues and the increase in lower-margin third party ISO revenues, combined with the impact of lower margin JetPay Payments, FL revenues and the continued investments made in technology professionals.\nThe cost of processing revenues within our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment increased $525,000, increasing as a percentage of revenues from 49.8% in 2015 to 50.4% in 2016 principally due to the increase in HR related service revenues and the continued investment in technology, customer service professionals and new product management. The effect of this increase in costs of processing revenues as a percentage of revenues was a decrease in gross profit margin within our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment from 50.2% in 2015 to 49.6% in 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses were $16.9 million, or 30.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $13.3 million, or 30.7% of revenues, for the same period in 2015.\nSG&A expenses within the Payment Services Segment increased from $6.9 million or 24.0% of revenues in 2015, to $9.3 million, or 22.7% of revenues in 2016. This increase was largely the result of SG&A expenses related to JetPay Payments, FL of $2.4 million and the continued increase in sales staff and marketing costs to attract new business.\n 32 \nSG&A expenses within our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment increased from $4.8 million in 2015 to $5.4 million in 2016, an increase of approximately $608,000, or 12.7%, largely due to an increase in payroll costs as additional sales and technology professionals were added to help develop new products and services and execute our HCM revenue growth strategies.\nAdditionally, we incurred corporate SG&A expenses of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, including the benefit of $1.9 million of management fees received from the Company's operating divisions as compared to corporate SG&A expenses of $1.7 million in the same period of 2015, including $1.43 million of management fees received from the operating divisions. Corporate SG&A expenses include, but are not limited to, the salaries of our executive officers, outside professional fees, acquisition costs, investor relations and other public company costs, and general corporate operating expenses. Corporate SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $669,000 of transaction costs related to the JetPay Payments, FL acquisition. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $399,000 as compared to $278,000 in 2015. The SG&A expenses of our JetPay HR & Payroll Segment include $360,000 and $350,000 of corporate allocated costs in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the Payment Processing Segment includes $1.54 million and $1.08 million of corporate allocated costs in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with an offsetting reduction in corporate SG&A expenses of $1.9 million and $1.43 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nSettlement of Legal Matter\nSettlement of Legal Matter charge of $6.19 million reflects the Company's loss based on the terms of the Merrick Settlement Agreement and the WLES Settlement Agreement. The loss includes: (i) a charge of $4.4 million related to the Company's release of all claims to the $4.4 million held in reserve at Merrick; (ii) a charge of $1.4 million related to the Company's issuance of the $3.85MM Note, less WLES' agreement to transfer to Merrick the WLES Note (recorded at $2,036,511 at June 30, 2016 net of an unamortized discount of $294,858) and accrued interest on the WLES Note of $414,466; (iii) a charge of $50,000 representing the Company's issuance of the $5.0MM Note, less the estimated value as of July 26, 2016 of the escrowed shares; and (iv) a charge for $373,334 representing the fair market value of the issuance of warrants to WLES on February 15, 2017 as described in the WLES Settlement Agreement.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization totaled $4.0 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily related to increased depreciation expense on 2016 capital expenditures and the amortization of the JetPay Payments, FL's intangible assets acquired on June 2, 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.2 million and $819,000, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2016 was primarily related to interest payments on the Fifth Third Bank term note issued on June 2, 2016 in connection with our acquisition of JetPay Payments, FL and the Notes issued to Merrick on July 26, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded income tax (benefit) expense of $(1.43) million and $197,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income tax expense reflects the recording of state income taxes. The effective tax rates were approximately (14.8)% and (19.7)% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year, primarily due to state and local income taxes and changes to the valuation allowance. Additionally, with the acquisition of JetPay Payments, FL and its related identifiable intangible and fixed assets, management recorded an associated $1.86 million deferred tax liability. Management believed that it was more likely than not that the benefit of a portion of its federal net deferred tax assets would be realized equal to the future source of income created by the amortization of the JetPay Payments, FL identifiable intangible and fixed asset assets, and accordingly, recorded a partial reduction of the valuation allowance against its federal deferred tax assets of $1.6 million.\nAnalysis of Impairment\nThe Company conducts its annual goodwill impairment testing as of December 31 of each year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We performed extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market approaches, in our goodwill assessment process for our two identified reporting units that contained goodwill, JetPay Payment Processing and JetPay HR & Payroll reporting segments.\n 33 \nIn our income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) analysis for each of our previously identified reporting units using discount rates of 16.5% for both our JetPay Payment Processing and JetPay HR & Payroll reporting segments, which represent the estimated weighted average cost of capital. These discount rates reflect the overall level of inherent risk involved in our reporting units and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In our DCF analysis, we prepared a five year forecast of our expected earnings to derive an expected stream of free cash flow through December 31, 2021. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our forecast, we used a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we estimated operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model, adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth assumption and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value. In developing our forecasts of revenues and direct variable operating expenses, we utilized a variety of factors including our current and anticipated sales pipelines of prospects currently known to us, as well as those which we believe will be generated through current and future relationships with merchants, agent banks and ISOs. We also applied our knowledge of the industries, general economic conditions, and the forecast of industry experts regarding consumers' continued trending towards expanded use of electronic payment methods. Our operating expenses are either variable with revenues, or fixed and predictable; however, we increased our future costs based on expected inflation and the need to expand personnel costs as we achieve projected future revenue levels. In performing our DCF analysis, we multiplied our estimated cash flows by a marginal federal and state tax rate of 40% to derive our after-tax cash flows, and we utilized weighted average costs of capital of 16.5% for both our JetPay Payment Processing reporting segment and JetPay HR & Payroll reporting segment analysis. In addition to the income approach, we also used several market-based approaches to corroborate the results of the income approach described above; including comparing our company's various earnings and performance indicators to those of similar publicly traded companies, comparisons to prior purchase and sales transactions of similar reporting units by companies, and a comparison to recent mergers and acquisitions of guideline companies.\nWith respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our JetPay Payment Processing reporting segment, as of December 31, 2016, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit was $69.8 million which exceeded the carrying value of net assets by $21.4 million, or 44.2%. With respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our JetPay HR & Payroll reporting segment, as of December 31, 2016, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit was $39.5 million which exceeded the carrying value of net assets by $13.5 million, or 51.9%. Events or circumstances that could have a negative effect on estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future include, but are not limited to, a loss of customers due to competition, pressure from our customers to reduce pricing, inability to continue to employ a competent workforce at current rates of pay, changes in government regulations, and accelerating costs beyond management's control.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents were $12.6 million at December 31, 2016, excluding $2.1 million of cash deposited into restricted cash accounts. The ratio of our total debt to total capitalization, which consists of total debt, convertible preferred stock, and stockholders' equity, was 25% and 23% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had working capital, excluding funds held for clients and client funds obligations, of approximately $5.0 million.\nWe expect to fund our cash needs, including capital required for acquisitions, with cash flow from our operating activities, sales of equity securities and borrowings. Additionally, we will require approximately $5.2 million, after giving effect to the payoff of a $5.0 million promissory note payable to Merrick Bank Corporation on January 11, 2017, See Note 17. Subsequent Events in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, to cover our interest and principal payments on our existing debt for the fifteen months ending March 31, 2018, capital expenditures of $3.9 million; and $314,000 of deferred consideration paid to the unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA on January 17, 2017. We expect to fund our cash needs for the next fifteen months, including debt service requirements, capital expenditures and possible future acquisitions, with cash flow from its operating activities, sales of equity securities (including the recent sale of preferred stock and borrowings, see below) and through new borrowings. As disclosed in Note 11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, from October 11, 2013 to October 18, 2016, we sold 99,666 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series A Preferred\u201d), to Flexpoint for an aggregate of $29.9 million, less certain costs. Additionally, on October 18, 2016, we sold 33,667 shares of Series A Preferred to Sundara for $10.1 million, less certain costs. In connection with the sale of shares of Series A Preferred to Sundara, we also entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with an affiliate of Sundara, LHLJ, Inc., for a term loan in the principal amount of $9.5 million, with $5.175 million of the proceeds used to simultaneously satisfy the remaining balances of a term loan and a revolving credit note payable to First National Bank of Pennsylvania (f/k/a Metro Bank) ( FNB\u201d) (the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Services Credit Facility\u201d). See Note 10. Long-Term debt, Note Payable and Capital Lease Obligations. Both Sundara and LHLJ are owned and controlled by Laurence L. Stone, who was appointed as a director of the Company pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated Series A Purchase Agreement. These two transactions provided approximately $14.0 million of net working capital which we used and expect to use for general working capital needs, the payment of other debt instruments, and for future capital needs, including a portion of the cost of potential future acquisitions. Finally, from May 5, 2014 to December 31, 2014, we sold 6,165 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series A-1 Preferred\u201d), to affiliates of Wellington Capital Management, LLP ( Wellington\u201d) for an aggregate of $1.85 million. Additionally, as disclosed in Note 12. Stockholders' Equity, from December 22, 2015 to January 22, 2016, we sold to certain accredited investors, including Bipin C. Shah, Robert B. Palmer, and Jonathan M. Lubert, an aggregate of 517,037 shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $2.70 per share for aggregate consideration of $1,396,000, prior to issuance costs.\n 34 \nCapital expenditures were $819,000 and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We currently estimate capital expenditures for all of our ongoing operations, including JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services, at approximately $3.0 million to $3.9 million for 2017, principally related to technology improvements and the implementation of major new customer contracts. Our capital requirements include working capital for daily operations, including expenditures to maintain and upgrade our technology platforms. Our operations currently generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our current operating needs and our routine debt service requirements.\nIn the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing by obtaining loans and selling shares of our equity securities, including the sale of shares Series A Preferred to Flexpoint and Sundara and the sale of shares of Series A-1 Preferred to Wellington. To fund and integrate future acquisitions or expand our technology platforms for new business initiatives, we will need to raise additional capital through loans, the sale of Series A-1 Preferred, or other sales of equity securities. In addition, we continue to investigate the capital markets for sources of funding, which could take the form of additional debt or equity financing. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in securing new financing or restructuring our current debt, or that we will secure such future financing with commercially acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may need to delay certain technology capital improvements, limit our planned level of capital expenditures and future growth plans or dispose of operating assets to generate cash to sustain operations and fund ongoing capital investments.\nDebt Capitalization and Other Financing Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2016, we had borrowings of approximately $21.9 million net of an unamortized deferred financing costs of $339,000.\nOn December 28, 2012, JetPay HR & Payroll Services and PTFS, as borrowers, entered into the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Credit Facility with FNB as the lender for a term loan with a principal amount of $9,000,000. Amounts outstanding under the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Credit Facility accrued interest at a rate of 4% per annum. The loan was schedule to mature on December 28, 2019, but was paid in full in October 2016, in connection with the LHLJ, Inc. ( LHLJ\u201d) loan.\nIn connection with the closing of our acquisitions of JetPay Payments, TX and JetPay HR & Payroll Services, we entered into a Note and Indemnity Side Agreement. Pursuant to the Note and Indemnity Side Agreement, we agreed to issue the WLES Note. Interest accrued on amounts due under the WLES Note at a rate of 5% per annum. Under the terms of the WLES Settlement Agreement, WLES transferred the WLES Note to Merrick on July 26, 2016. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies.\nOn November 7, 2014, pursuant to a Unit Purchase Agreement by and between the Company, JetPay Payments, PA and Michael Collester and Cathy Smith, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of JetPay Payments, PA for an aggregate of $11.0 million in cash and the issuance of 2.0 million shares of its common stock to the unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA with a value of approximately $3.7 million on the date of acquisition. The previous unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA were entitled to receive additional cash consideration of $2.4 million, $1.2 million of which was paid on April 10, 2015 and $1.2 million of which was paid on April 10, 2016, and were entitled to earn up to an additional $500,000 based on the net revenues of JetPay Payments, PA for the twelve month periods ended October 31, 2015 and 2016, of which $186,000 was paid to the previous unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA in February 2016 and $314,000 on January 17, 2017, satisfying this obligation in full. In order to finance a portion of the proceeds paid to the previous unitholders of JetPay Payments, PA, JetPay Payments, PA, as borrower, and the Company and JetPay HR & Payroll Services, as guarantors, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement on November 7, 2014 with FNB with a principal amount of $7.5 million (as amended, the JetPay Payments, PA Credit Facility\u201d). Amounts outstanding under the loan accrue interest at a rate of 5.25% per annum. The loan matures on November 6, 2021 and amortizes in equal monthly installments of $104,167. The principal balance of this term loan was $6.04 million at December 31, 2016. Additional principal payments may be required at the end of each fiscal year based on a free cash flow calculation set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement.\n 35 \nOn May 6, 2015, JetPay HR & Payroll Services and PTFS, as borrowers, along with the Company, JetPay Payments, PA, and JetPay, Payments, TX, collectively as loan parties, entered into a First Amendment and Joinder Agreement to the Loan and Security Agreement dated December 28, 2012 and a Revolving Credit Note (the Revolving Note\u201d) dated May 6, 2015 with FNB, as the lender. The Revolving Note provided a $1.0 million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on May 6, 2017 and accrued interest at the rate of the Wall Street Journal Prime rate plus 1.00%, with a floor of 4.25%. On May 6, 2015, the proceeds of the $1.0 million Revolving Note, along with $650,000 of current cash and cash equivalents, were used to partially fund a $2.0 million deferred consideration liability due to the stockholders of ADC. The Revolving Note was paid in full on October 18, 2016.\nOn January 15, 2016, we issued promissory notes to each of Messrs. Shah and Lubert, and Flexpoint. The promissory notes each had an interest rate of 12% per annum and were scheduled to mature on April 14, 2016. The $1.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the promissory notes was used as cash collateral recorded as restricted cash to replace a $1.9 million letter of credit in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. On April 11, 2016, the Company entered into letter agreements with each of Messrs. Shah and Lubert, and Flexpoint to extend until July 31, 2016 the maturity dates of the Promissory Notes. On July 26, 2016, Jonathan Lubert and Flexpoint agreed to further extend their promissory notes to September 30, 2016. Additionally, Flexpoint increased the principal amount of its promissory note from $1,000,000 to $1,400,000. On September 30, 2016, Jonathan Lubert and Flexpoint extended the term of their promissory notes to October 31, 2016. Each of the he promissory notes were repaid on October 21, 2016. We are currently working with several financial institutions to secure a $1.9 million letter of credit at which time the restricted cash reserves would be released to the Company. There can be no assurance that a letter of credit will be obtained or obtained on reasonable terms.\nOn June 2, 2016, in connection with the closing of the JetPay Payments, FL acquisition, JetPay Payments, FL and the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Fifth Third Bank. In connection with the Credit Agreement, JetPay Payments, FL issued in favor of Fifth Third Bank a term note with a principal amount of $1,068,960 and a $500,000 revolving note to refinance certain credit arrangements of JetPay Payments, FL in place at another financial institution prior to the closing of the transaction. The term note matures on November 30, 2019 and bears interest at 4.00%. The revolving note matures on June 2, 2017 and the bears interest at a rate of 2.00% plus the LIBOR Rate for the applicable interest period. The term note and the revolving note are secured by the assets of JetPay Payments, FL and guaranteed by JetPay. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants, including a financial covenant related to JetPay Payments, FL's fixed charge coverage ratio, which the Company was in compliance as of December 31, 2016.\nOn July 26, 2016, as part of the Merrick Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to issue in favor of Merrick the $3.85MM Note and the $5.00MM Note. The Notes were secured by the 3,333,333 shares of JetPay's common stock issued in the name of WLES and held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (described above). The $3.85MM Note was satisfied in full on October 21, 2016 and the $5.00MM Note was satisfied in full on January 11, 2017.\nOn October 18, 2016, JetPay HR & Payroll Services and PTFS, as borrowers, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement\u201d) with LHLJ, Inc., a Delaware corporation controlled by Laurence L. Stone, as lender, for a term loan in the principal amount of $9.5 million (the LHLJ Debt Investment\u201d). The underlying promissory note bears interest at 8%. The loan matures on October 18, 2021 and is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of $128,677 with a final payment of $4.75 million at maturity. The obligations of the borrowers under the Loan Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and JetPay Payments, FL, and are secured by all of the assets of JetPay HR & Payroll Services, PTFS and JetPay Payments, FL, as well as a pledge by the Company of its ownership interests in JetPay HR & Payroll Services, PTFS and JetPay Payments, FL. The Loan Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates and other customary restrictions for loans of this type and size. The borrowers are also subject to financial covenants relating to their debt coverage ratio and total leverage ratio during the term of the loan. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2016. The principal balance of this term loan was $9.37 million at December 31, 2016.\nA portion of the proceeds of the LHLJ Debt Investment was used to simultaneously satisfy the remaining balance of $4.175 million outstanding under the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Services Credit Facility. In connection with the satisfaction of the Borrowers' obligations under the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Services Credit Facility, JetPay Payments, PA, JetPay HR & Payroll Services, the Company and FNB entered into an amendment to the JetPay Payments, PA Credit Facility to release JetPay HR & Payroll Service's guaranty of the obligations of JetPay Payments, PA under the JetPay Payments, PA Credit Facility and to eliminate provisions relating to the cross-collateralization of the JetPay Payments, PA Credit Facility and the Prior JetPay HR & Payroll Services Credit Facility.\n 36 \nOur ongoing ability to comply with the debt covenants under our credit arrangements and to refinance our debt depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of cash flow. If our future cash flows are less than expected or our debt service, including interest expense, increases more than expected, causing us to default on any of the loan covenants in the future, we will need to obtain amendments or waivers from the applicable lender. In the event that non-compliance with the debt covenants should occur in the future, we would pursue various alternatives in an attempt to successfully resolve the non-compliance, which might include, among other things, seeking additional debt covenant waivers or amendments or refinancing debt with other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that debt covenant waivers or amendments would be obtained, if needed, or that the debt could be refinanced with other financial institutions on favorable terms.\nAdditionally, in connection with the December 2012 $9.0 million term loan, the November 2014 $7.5 million term loan, and the May 2015 Revolving Note, all payable to FNB, we incurred $23,000, $76,000, and $40,000 of deferred financing costs, respectively. Finally, we incurred (i) $95,000 of deferred financing fees related to the issuance of the Promissory Notes and (ii) $16,600 of deferred financing fees related to JetPay Payments, FL's term note and revolving note, each in favor of Fifth Third Bank, and $310,000 of deferred financing fees related to the LHLJ, Inc.

For example, JetPay Payment Services experiences increased purchase activity during the first and second quarters due to seasonal volumes of some merchants in JetPay Payment Services' portfolio. Revenues during the first and second quarters tend to increase in comparison to the remaining two quarters of JetPay Payment Services' fiscal year on a same store basis.\nJetPay Payments, FL's expects increased revenues during the first and fourth quarters due to seasonal volumes of certain government and utility clients and their billing cycles.\nJetPay HR & Payroll Services' revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned. JetPay HR & Payroll Services experiences increased revenues during the fourth and first quarters due to the processing of additional year-end tax filing requirements. Accordingly, revenues and earnings are greater in the fourth and first quarter in comparison to the remaining two quarters of JetPay HR & Payroll Services' fiscal year.\n 38 \nEffects of Inflation\nJetPay Payment Services' and JetPay HR & Payroll Services' monetary assets, consisting primarily of cash and receivables, are not significantly affected by inflation. Non-monetary assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, are not affected by inflation. We believe that replacement costs of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and other operating expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us. The rate of inflation can also affect our revenues by affecting our client's payroll processing volumes and our merchant charge volume and corresponding changes to processing revenues. While these can be positive or negative, since a portion of JetPay Payment Services' revenues are derived as a percentage of dollar volume processed, JetPay Payment Services' revenues will generally rise when inflation rises. Additionally, JetPay HR & Payroll Services' revenues include the interest earned on the funds held for clients investment trust account balance. Trust fund earnings can fluctuate based on the amount held in the trust account as well as fluctuations in interest rates.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.
