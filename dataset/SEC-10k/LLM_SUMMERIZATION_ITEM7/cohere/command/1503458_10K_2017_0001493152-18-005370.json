Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Report. The discussions of results, causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that these results or trends will necessarily occur. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve assumptions, and describe our future plans, strategies, and expectations. Such statements are generally identifiable by use of the words may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d plan,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d intend,\u201d or project\u201d or the negative of these words of other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These statements are expressed in good faith and based upon a reasonable basis when made, but there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved or accomplished.\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions that may not materialize or that may not be accurate. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such factors include, among others: changes in oil or natural gas prices, the success of our drilling program, the timing of planned capital expenditures, availability of acquisitions, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as our ability to access them, the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities, uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business, and the other factors discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus and in other documents that we file with or furnish to the SEC, all of which are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements may include statements about:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our business strategy; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our reserves or reserves that we may expect to develop; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our cash flows and liquidity; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our financial strategy, budget, projections and operating results; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>oil and natural gas prices that we may realize; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the timing and amount of future production of oil and natural gas; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the availability of drilling and production equipment; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the availability of oil field labor; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the amount, nature and timing of capital expenditures, including future exploration and development costs; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the availability and terms of capital; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our drilling of wells; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>government regulation and taxation of the oil and natural gas industry; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our marketing of oil and natural gas; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our exploitation projects or our ability to make property acquisitions on terms that meet our acquisition criteria; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our costs of exploiting and developing our properties and conducting other operations; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>general economic conditions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td>22 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>competition in the oil and natural gas industry; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the effectiveness of our risk management and possible future hedging activities; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>environmental liabilities; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our future operating results; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>estimated future reserves and the present value thereof; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions contained in this report that are not historical. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we believe that the expectations conveyed by the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information available to us on the date such forward-looking statements were made, no assurances can be given as to future results, levels of activity, achievements or financial condition.\nYou should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should recognize that these statements are predictions of future results, which may not occur as anticipated. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements and from historical results, due to the risks and uncertainties described above, as well as others not now anticipated. The impact of any one factor on a particular forward-looking statement is not determinable with certainty as such factors are interdependent upon other factors. The foregoing statements are not exclusive and further information concerning us, including factors that potentially could materially affect our financial results, may emerge from time to time. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements, except as required by law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nUnless otherwise noted, the terms the Company\u201d, Foothills Exploration\u201d, Foothills\u201d, we\u201d, or our\u201d refer to the ongoing business operations of Foothills Exploration, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Foothills Petroleum, Inc., as well as, the past operations of Foothills Petroleum, Inc. The terms Key Link Assets Corp.\u201d or Key Link\u201d refer to the operations of Key Link Assets Corp. prior to May 27, 2016.\nHistory\nFoothills Exploration, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 13, 2010, under the name Key Link Assets Corp.\u201d for the purpose of acquiring a portfolio of heavily discounted real estate properties in the Chicago metropolitan area. The Company changed its focus and planned to acquire small and medium sized grocery stores in non-urban locales that are not directly served by large national supermarket chains.\nOn May 2, 2016, Foothills Petroleum Inc., a Nevada corporation ( FPI\u201d) acquired approximately 14.1 million pre-split (56.4 million post-split) shares of the Company's common stock constituting approximately 96% of our then issued and outstanding shares ( FPI Acquired Shares\u201d). As of May 16, 2016, we effected a 4:1 forward split of our shares of common stock.\nOn May 27, 2016, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with shareholders of FPI whereby we acquired all of the outstanding shares of FPI in exchange for 4,500,000 shares of our common stock and also issued 1,503,759 shares of our common stock on automatic conversion of debt (please see discussion below under Overview) for an aggregate of 6,003,759 shares of our common stock (the Share Exchange\u201d). As a result of the Share Exchange, FPI became our wholly owned subsidiary and the FPI Acquired Shares were returned to treasury and deemed cancelled. For accounting purposes, this transaction is being accounted for as a reverse acquisition and has been treated as a recapitalization of the Company with FPI considered the accounting acquirer, and the financial statements of the accounting acquirer became the financial statements of the registrant. The completion of the Share Exchange resulted in a change of control. The FPI Shareholders obtained approximately 96% of voting control on the date of Share Exchange. FPI was the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Company was the acquired company. The consolidated financial statements after the acquisition include the balance sheets of both companies at historical cost, the historical results of FPI and the results of the Company from the acquisition date. All share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been retroactively restated to reflect the recapitalization.\nPrior to the Share Exchange, we had minimal assets and recognized no revenues from operations, and were accordingly classified as a shell company. On June 24, 2016, we filed an amendment to our Current Report on Form 8-K originally filed on June 10, 2016, indicating that we were no longer a shell company as defined by Rule12b-2 of the Exchange Act. In light of closing of the Share Exchange transaction with FPI, the Company became actively engaged in oil and gas operations through its wholly owned subsidiary.\nOn June 30, 2016, we completed a sale of 3,007,519 shares of our common stock to a single investor for proceeds totaling $2,000,000. For a more complete description of this transaction please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 7, 2016.\nOn August 4, 2016, we were advised that the Financial Industry Regulatory Association had approved (i) our name change from Key Link Assets Corp. to Foothills Exploration, Inc., and (ii) a change of trading symbol from KYLK to FTXP. Please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 9, 2016.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td>23 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 5, 2016, the Company launched its Exploration Division and opened a new office in Houston to support the division's staff. The Company's Exploration Division consists of geologists and petroleum engineers engaged in the exploration and development of hydrocarbons and tasked with building a portfolio of high impact exploration projects in the Gulf Coast region.\nOn December 12, 2016, the Company entered into a participation agreement with Magna Operating, LLC, a privately held Houston-based independent exploration and production company ( Magna Operating\u201d), in relation to the Labokay prospect, covering approximately 240 acres in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. As consideration for an assignment of interest in and to the leases and the prospect, Foothills Petroleum Operating, Inc., a Nevada corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( FPOI\u201d), tendered to Magna Operating the purchase price in the amount of $144,000. This amount covered FPOI's share of the land, lease, and administrative costs that Magna Operating incurred in generating and assembling the Labokay prospect as of November 15, 2016. As further consideration for an assignment of working interest in and to the leases, FPOI agreed to participate in the cost, risk, and expense of drilling the Labokay test well. The well was plugged and abandoned in February 2017. The Company has no immediate plans to engage in further exploration and development activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.\nOn December 30, 2016, the Company acquired various oil and gas assets in Utah from Total Belief Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of New Times Energy Corporation Limited. These assets included certain oil and gas wells throughout the Uinta Basin in Utah on acreage with over 30 proven undeveloped drilling locations, additional non-operating interest in other leases, and access to approximately 6,000 acres in the Uinta Basin with proven and probable reserves and existing infrastructure in place. Through the acquisition, Foothills also obtained six shut-in wells in the Natural Buttes Field, Utah. The transaction provides Foothills with the rights to an agreement to acquire up to 6,000+ acres and up to 16 shut-in oil and gas wells with proved and proved undeveloped reserves on Tribal lands in the Uinta Basin. This acquisition delivers to the Company an additional 40% working interest in the Ladysmith Prospect covering 3,060 acres in the Greater Green River Basin, Wyoming, bringing the Company's total working interest in the prospect from 35% (pre-acquisition) up to 75%.\nBy this agreement, the Company acquired 13,166,667 shares, constituting 55.63% of the outstanding shares of Grey Hawk Exploration, Inc. ( Grey Hawk\u201d), a British Columbia, Canada company. Grey Hawk owns a non-operated working interest in two non-producing wells in the southern portion of the Natural Buttes Field.\nOn December 30, 2016, the Company also acquired the remaining 25% membership interest in Tiger Energy Partners International, LLC ( TEPI\u201d) from Green Stone Capital Partners Limited, a Cayman Islands limited liability company, in exchange for assumption of Greenstone's proportionate share of TEPI obligations and liabilities.\nOn May 10, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement (PSA), with an undisclosed seller, to acquire 67,330 gross acres (49,600 net acres) held by production in Utah and Colorado. This acquisition was anticipated to close by or before June 30, 2017, such closing being subject to traditional representations, warranties, covenants and adjustments including, but not limited to lien releases, cures of any defective title matters, satisfaction of leases and amendments thereto. In August 2017, the parties by mutual agreement terminated the PSA.\nOn October 19, 2017, the Company announced the acquisition of 21% working interest in two horizontal gas wells in the Uinta Basin from an undisclosed party. Both wells are operated by EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EOG). We expect total cost for our 21% working interest in both wells will be $3.2 million. These wells align with the Company's overall growth strategy for the Basin and provides us with the ability to gain insight from a world-class operator. In February 2018, the Company announced the successful drilling, completion and flow testing of the Stagecoach 111-20H and Stagecoach 117-20H horizontal wells, both of which are now producing natural gas in commercial quantities. Both wells have been online since late December 2017 and production tubing is expected to be set in the near term. These two successful horizontal wells will generate production and net cash flow for the Company and are expected to payout within 30 months. As of December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $1,501,377 cost for our shares of interest.\nOverview\nFoothills Exploration is an independent oil and gas exploration company engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties, mainly through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Foothills Petroleum, Inc. ( FPI\u201d). FPI is focused on acquiring producing and developmental properties in the Rockies. FPI seeks to acquire non-core, dislocated and underdeveloped oil and gas assets and maximize those assets to create shareholder value (the Business\u201d).\nOn December 31, 2015, FPI acquired the rights to 38,120 acres of oil and gas property in the state of Wyoming, through Foothills Exploration, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary acquired by FPI upon its organization in December 2015.\nThe Company's principal obligations include:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>A debenture in the amount of $1,250,000, plus interest accruing at a rate of 9% per annum issued to Berwin Trading Limited ( Berwin\u201d) with principal and interest due upon maturity on May 6, 2017. On May 5, 2017, the Company and Berwin agreed to extend the maturity date of the debenture to June 20, 2017, in return for an annual interest rate increase from 9% to 13.5% per annum for the life of the debenture. On November 3, 2017, Berwin agreed to defer repayment of this note to a later date, and acknowledged that the Company is not in default regarding this Debenture. Berwin also reaffirmed its belief that the Company will either extend or repay the obligation to their satisfaction. As partial consideration for the deferment, the Company agreed to issue Berwin 100,000 shares of its restricted common stock, valued at $48,000. The issuance of the shares in exchange for the maturity extension was treated as a modification of existing debt pursuant to the guidance of ASC 470-50 Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d ( ASC 470-50\u201d). On February 28, 2018, Berwin and the Company agreed to extend the maturity date of the debenture to June 30, 2018, and as consideration for the extension, the Company agreed to compensate Berwin with 250,000 shares of restricted common stock. In addition, the parties agreed that if payment of said principal and interest due and payable is made late, then a penalty payment of $125,000 shall become due and payable to Berwin by the Company. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>A second debenture in the amount of $1,000,000, plus interest accruing at a rate of 9% issued to Full Wealth Investment Hong Kong Limited ( Full Wealth\u201d) with principal and interest due upon maturity on or before May 5, 2017.

This amount of $342,804 was determined using the present value method based on the following assumptions: (i) adjusted interest rate 4% (ii) expected life of 1.5 years. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we amortized $228,536 debt discount into interest expense.

On October 19, 2017, the Company agreed to extend the allowable conversion period provided under this convertible note until May 10, 2018. On November 7, 2017, the Company issued 50,000 warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a strike price of $1.00 per share expiring on May 7, 2019.

Because the fair value of the shares was greater than 10% of the present value of the remaining cash flows under the Note, the issuance of the shares in connection with a more favorable term of a note entered with FirstFire Opportunity Fund, LLC. was treated as a debt extinguishment and reissuance of a new debt instrument pursuant to the guidance of ASC 470-50 Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d ( ASC 470-50\u201d).

The aggregate value of the warrants and imputed interest of $107,536 was considered as debt discount upon issuance and will be amortized as interest over the term of the Note or in full upon the conversion of the Note. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company amortized $105,272 of such discount to interest expense, and the unamortized discount as of December 31, 2017 was $2,264.

See the Company's Current Report on the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 5, 2017. Of this amount, 100,752 shares and warrants to purchase 100,752 shares of common stock will be issued to Wilshire Energy Partners LLC, an entity controlled by Kevin J. Sylla. The exercise price of these investor warrants was adjusted to $0.665 per share. We measured the value of the effect of the down round feature as the difference between the fair value of the financial instrument at an original exercise price of $1.50 and an adjusted exercise price of $0.665 and, as a result, $59,801 was recorded as down round feature as interest expense under ASC 260-10-30-1. Foothills determined the amount of $59,801 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: (i) volatility rate of 94%, (ii) discount rate of 0%, (iii) zero expected dividend yield, and (iv) expected life of 3 years.\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>A convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $267,500, with net proceeds of $250,000 before giving effect to certain transactional costs including legal fees, was issued to FirstFire Opportunity Fund, LLC, on November 17, 2017.

These assets included certain oil and gas wells throughout the Uinta Basin in Utah, on acreage with over 30 proven undeveloped drilling locations, additional non-operating interest in other leases, and access to approximately 6,000 acres in the Uinta Basin with proven and probable reserves and existing infrastructure in place. This purchase provides the Company with an entry point into the Uinta Basin and a basis from which to seek other bolt-on acquisition opportunities in the Rockies. The transaction delivers to the Company a licensed and bonded operator in Utah having bonds in place with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), State of Utah and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).\nThrough this acquisition from New Times, the Company also obtained six shut-in wells in the Natural Buttes Field, Utah. After the acquisition, these wells were worked over and brought back online with production averaging around 183 barrels per month in Q2 2017. The Company plans to work over the remaining three wells in the coming months.\nThe transaction provided the Company with the rights to an agreement to acquire up to 6,000+ acres and up to 16 shut-in oil and gas wells with proved and proved undeveloped reserves on Ute Tribal lands in the Uinta Basin. These properties provide in-field drilling potential, the ability to bring online shut-in wells and behind pipe development. Five shut-in wells located on fee lands in the Altamont-Bluebell Field that are undergoing title curative have the potential to achieve near term production with stimulation and the addition of surface equipment.\nFurthermore, this acquisition delivered to the Company an additional 40% working interest in the Ladysmith Prospect, covering 3,060 acres in the Greater Green River Basin, Wyoming, increasing the Company's pre-acquisition working interest of 35% up to a total of 75%.\nLastly, through this acquisition, the Company also acquired 13,166,667 shares of common stock, constituting 55.63% of the outstanding shares of Grey Hawk Exploration, Inc. ( Grey Hawk\u201d), a British Columbia, Canada company. Grey Hawk owns a non-operated working interest in two wells in the southern portion of the Greater Natural Buttes Field in Utah. These two wells are not currently producing.\nTo acquire these assets, the Company paid a total consideration of $10.75 million in a combination of cash, stock and promissory note consisting of:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>$750,000 cash; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>2,083,334 shares of the Company's restricted common stock valued by the parties at $4,000,000 at an agreed upon price per share of $1.92; and a </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Promissory note in the principal amount of $6,000,000 due and payable in full 18 months from December 30, 2016 and accruing no interest during its term. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor financial accounting purposes the 2,083,334 shares were valued at the closing market price on the day of the transaction, which was $1.83, accordingly the shares were presented at a value of $3,812,501 on the Company's financial statements on December 30, 2016.\nOur financial statements reflect that our current liabilities exceed our current assets and it is possible that the historical value of the assets that we record on our books may not be attained on a sale or other disposition for cash. We require substantial additional operating capital to maintain current operations and to implement even a portion of our identified acquisitions and workovers. Additional capital, if available at all, will likely be on onerous terms that are also dilutive to our shareholders. No assurance can be given that we will obtain any additional capital. As a consequence, an investment in our shares or other securities is extremely speculative and may result in a complete loss of your investment.\nMarket Environment\nThe U.S. energy markets continued to see improved fundamentals for both crude oil and natural gas markets during 3Q17, as prices remained in a tight range for both products and volatility at the low end of the range relative to historic averages. Looking ahead at the remainder of the year and into 2018, we believe the U.S. energy markets are poised for a major price move for both crude oil and natural gas prices as well as a significant uptick in price volatility. Our bias remains moderately bullish for both WTI and natural gas prices going forward and we are looking for a breakout above the current trading ranges that has dominated year-to-date.\nOil - As disclosed in our previous Form 10-Q Quarterly Report for period ended June 30, 2017, OPEC and Non-OPEC producing nations' production cuts announced earlier in the year have reportedly begun to reduce global oil supplies. We are now seeing that in the global pricing structure as Brent crude oil price is now trading at roughly a $6 premium to the WTI crude oil price. We believe that the catalyst for the widening spread is twofold: 1) U.S. shale production continued to grow reportedly reaching 9.2 million barrels per day, its highest level since November 2015 and 2) global oil supplies reportedly are falling, highlighted by a 14.2 million barrel drop in August 2017. We believe that when Brent trades at a $4 premium or greater to WTI, U.S. oil becomes a more attractive export, resulting in greater U.S. oil exports in 2017. We expect that this trend likely may continue in 2018. In short, robust U.S. oil exports coupled with strong U.S. demand for refined products, should accelerate in our view the decline rate for U.S. oil supplies and be supportive of oil prices moving forward.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>26 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGlobal demand for crude oil continues to grow at a steady pace. The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its most recent monthly oil market report for October 2017 forecasted global demand for crude oil growing by 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and by 1.4 million bpd in 2018. The IEA also estimates that global oil demand will reach 100.0 million barrels per day in Q4 2018, which would set a record that in our view will become a key psychological level for the oil markets. In the U.S., the IEA forecasts gasoline demand will average 9.3 million barrels per day in 2017, and 9.4 million barrels per day in 2018, an annual increase of 1%. Reported global demand for oil and refined products are at or near record levels, which is alleviating the supply overhang and in our view supporting a bullish outlook heading into the end of the year and into 2018.\nNatural Gas - After being in a bear market for nearly a decade, we believe that commodity fundamentals have significantly improved over the course of 2017 to date. With LNG exports and exports to Mexico reportedly at record levels, the U.S. appears slated to become a net exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1957. We expect U.S. dry gas production to be roughly 71 BCF per day in 2017, while demand and export growth should average about 76 BCF per day. Given this, the natural gas storage glut has been significantly reduced with current storage levels now at the trailing 5-year average as we head into the heating/withdrawal season. A stronger-than-expected heating season driven by colder than average temperatures in key heating regions could send natural gas prices above $4.00 MMBtu.\nOur Strategy\nFoothills' strategic objective is to build a portfolio of producing properties that have relatively low operating costs, long lived reserves and upside development potential. The Company's goal is to build a land bank of over 200,000 acres of proven, probable and prospective reserves during this period of relatively low commodity pricing. Foothills intends to accomplish this by acquiring oil and gas properties with attractive valuation metrics and attractive geological risk/reward profiles that are well positioned to benefit from an improvement in commodity prices. No assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve this objective.\nThe Company's primary focus is the Rocky Mountain region, where its consultants and technical staff have conducted oil and gas operations and collectively have in our view developed significantly material operating experience. Management believes that the Company's tight geographical focus and regional experience, coupled with our strategic industry relationships may advantageously position Foothills to acquire high quality oil and gas assets at attractive valuations in the current environment.\nThe Company's acquisitions and roll up strategy is based on identifying undercapitalized, yet attractive oil and gas assets selling at what we anticipate to be a discount to intrinsic value. Foothills focuses on acquiring oil and gas assets that have existing production, with existing infrastructure in place and future developmental potential. Once we acquire oil and gas assets, management expects to target adjacent oil and gas properties with similar characteristics for bolt on acquisitions to increase our geographical acreage position. By consolidating and exploiting additional acreage as part of its rollup strategy, management intends to achieve operating efficiencies to maximize shareholder value.\nWyoming Properties\nThe principal Wyoming assets owned by the Company currently consist of non-producing, yet prospective mineral leases in the Ladysmith project.\nLadysmith Project\nFoothills owns a 75% working interest in the Ladysmith Anticline prospect that is located in Fremont County, Wyoming. Total acreage position is 3,061 acres located between the Great Divide/Greater Green River Basin and the Wind River Basin. The primary target zones are the variable Phosphoria and Tensleep sandstone with secondary considerations in the Madison limestone and Flathead sandstone. The prospect generation was based on licensed 2-D seismic comprising of two seismic lines covering the Chevron/Echo - Greater Green River Basin. Foothills' has conducted two BLM onsite inspections to date and work continues on a surface access use agreement, completion of drilling unit outline and a schedule for BLM area and depth meeting in the near term. Spring conditions will soon enable Foothills to gain access to prospect area and commence Right of Way (ROW) application, surveying and archeology study. Additional BLM acreage acquisition and federal unit formation are continued processes, with detailed development plans for surface use being formulated.\nSprings Project\nDuring Q4 2017, the Company allowed the BLM leases for the Springs project to expire without paying additional delay rental payments. The primary terms on these leases were due to expire in Q4 2018 and management did not feel it was in the best interest of the Company stakeholders to continue its exploratory efforts on a speculative, wildcat play. As such, Management made a business decision to reduce the Company's portfolio of exploration plays and instead continue seeking lower-risk acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties rather than take additional wildcat drilling risk on this prospect. As such, the Company no longer owns the mineral rights for this project. As the result, the Company recognized impairment of oil and gas property in amount of $150,593, during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPaw Paw Project\nThe Paw Paw project is a 3-D seismic defined prospect, which covers 4,467 acres and is a direct analog to the highly productive Tensleep Formation Enigma\u201d Field (EUR 3.7 million barrels of oil) located only two miles to the south. The Tensleep Formation has a history of prolific area production with two nearby analogues. The Paw Paw project has potential from primary and secondary recovery of up to 2 million barrels of oil. On December 11, 2016, the Company completed drilling operations on the Paw Paw Federal #1 test well. The Big Horn County Wyoming test well reached total depth in the Madison Formation and the Company successfully logged and acquired valid data to further evaluate the project's potential. The Company's technical team and consulting geological firm, Geopinion\u00ae Inc., is continuing to evaluate test well results and further interpret and analyze 3D seismic data in order to identify favorable potential future locations for possible commercial wells. The test well has been temporarily abandoned while the parties continue to analyze results during the evaluation stage.\nThe Paw Paw Federal #1 test well reached total depth in the Madison Formation after drilling an anticipated stratigraphic section and thrust fault. Oil shows were found in the Muddy, Phosphoria, and Madison formations. The Phosphoria is a regionally productive formation and could end up being the secondary zone in sidetrack operations should that type of operation be deemed commercially economic. Upon evaluation of the test well's seismic structural position and analysis of modern well log data, the technical team has determined that a successful sidetrack operation is likely to yield commercial oil reserves from the Tensleep and any other sands with oil shows and concurred that the test well, which is temporarily abandoned, should be considered for re-entry. The Company intends to sidetrack this well with the objective of eventually completing this well to produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons from the target formation. We encountered a fault while drilling the well, which required additional geological and engineering work. The Company has since mapped out the issue and intends to continue drilling operations. The Company has deferred recommencing drilling operations because certain lease title issues were encountered during the period of geological discovery, which the Company is currently working to mend. The Company intends to recommence continuous operations with the objective of sidetracking this well to produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons from the target formation during Q3 2018, once certain wildlife stipulations affecting oil and gas operations on the BLM lands surrounding this well come to an end. No assurance can be given that these precise efforts by our experienced technical team and our further development efforts of the prospect, including further drilling activity, will yield a commercially successful well.\nIronwood Project\nThe Company had intended to drill a test well on the Ironwood prospect during the first half of 2017 but was unable to do so within the agreement term and as such, the Company failed to earn into this prospect to hold the acreage from current production and no longer has any rights to this project. During the second half of 2017 Management decided to focus its full attention on acquiring and developing properties with existing reserves and infield development opportunities rather than take additional wildcat drilling risk on any prospect.\nUtah Properties\nTiger Energy Operating, LLC\nTiger Energy Operating, LLC, ( TEO\u201d) is a licensed and bonded oil and gas operator in the state of Utah. TEO is the operator of record for a total of six oil and gas wells situated on 280 acres in the Duck Creek area of the Altamont Bluebell field. In late 2015 and early 2016 these wells were shut-in due to financial issues with the previous owner. During the calendar year 2017, the Company sold a total of approximately 2,137 barrels of oil, which were produced from three of its Duck Creek wells. The Company has developed a Duck Creek optimization program and needs to raise approximately $900,000 to complete workover operations on these wells, which are expected to increase total production to approximately 210 barrels of oil per day. Management anticipates obtaining the necessary capital enabling the Company to implement this workover program during the current fiscal year. TEO has cash and surety bonds in place with the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Utah Department of Natural Resources Division of Oil, Gas and Mining that are valued at about $295,000.\nTiger Energy Partners International, LLC\nTiger Energy Partners International, LLC, ( TEPI\u201d) owns all rights and interests pertaining to the Global Settlement Agreement ( GSA\u201d) for the Uintah and Ouray Reservation between Mountain Oil & Gas, Inc. and the MOG Entities (Craig Phillips) and the Ute Indian Tribe (the Tribe\u201d) of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, dated December 22, 2014. TEPI also owns all rights and interests acquired in the Purchase and Sale Agreements between TEPI and Mountain Oil & Gas, Inc. dated April 16, 2012, and December 18, 2012. TEPI expects to move forward with this transaction in 2018 via a revised Global Settlement Agreement with the parties to said agreement. The Company is bound by confidentiality provisions in the GSA and as such is prohibited from disclosing any additional details.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td>28 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTiger Energy Mineral Leasing, LLC\nTiger Energy Mineral Leasing, LLC ( TEML\u201d) owns certain non-operating working interests, which were previously operated by Rig II, LLC. In 2017, Rig II, LLC, sold its operating rights in said leases to Crescent Point Energy Corp. (NYSE: CPG), who is the current operator of record for these leases. The Company realized approximately $4,532 in total net revenues during 2017 from this non-operated working interest. In addition, TEML also owns a 40% working interest, in the Ladysmith prospect, which increases the Company's total working interest in this prospect to 75%. TEML also owns all rights and interests pertaining to the Rio Capital Acquisition dated September 25, 2014, pertaining to oil and gas leases in the Altamont-Bluebell field located in Duchesne and Uintah Counties, Utah.\nGulf Coast Properties\nOn December 15, 2016, the Company announced a Participation Agreement with Magna Operating, LLC, in relation to the Labokay prospect, covering 240 acres in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana.\nLabokay Prospect\nLabokay is an amplitude versus offset\u201d ( AVO\u201d) oil play in Southwestern Louisiana targeting the Frio Nododaria Blanpiedi Sand. On February 14, 2017, the Company announced that it had reached total depth in its Labokay Prospect well located in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. The well was drilled to a total measured depth of 8,795 feet where hydrocarbon shows were present, but not in commercial quantities to warrant completion. The well has been plugged and abandoned as required. The Company estimates well costs incurred or to be incurred for the Labokay at approximately $1.3 million, including plugging and abandonment liability.\nThe Company has no immediate plans to engage in further exploration and development activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.\nPlan of Operations\nCurrent energy prices have exposed attractive U.S. based assets that are poorly capitalized and neglected, which are now selling at discounted prices, providing multiple entry points to acquire attractive oil and gas assets. Foothills intends to acquire dislocated and non-core oil and gas assets from larger exploration and production companies.\nFoothills is focused on acquiring and rolling up smaller operators in a considerably fragmented oil and gas market and through consolidation, management believes Foothills can effectively scale its production and acreage position and collectively unlock value in the acquired oil and gas assets to create shareholder value. No assurance can be given that the Company will acquire adequate cash or other resources to be able to attain any of these objectives.\nAcquiring additional assets and companies in the Rockies\nThe Company is targeting acquisitions in a tightly defined geographical area of interest, which meet certain metrics and future development potential. The Company anticipates that these acquisitions will be funded through the sale of common stock, debt and cash generated from the Company's financing activities, including public, private and possible institutional offerings in capital market transactions and future reserve based lending activities. Subject to the securing of additional capital, the Company anticipates making additional bolt-on acquisitions of producing properties, which can potentially be leveraged and optimized by applying its technical capabilities and improving operational efficiencies. Although the Company is currently evaluating several prospective acquisitions, which meet its criteria, no assurance can be given that it will be successful in any of these endeavors.\nRetain Operational Control and Significant Working Interest\nIn its principal acquisition and development targets, the Company aims to preserve operational control of its development and drilling activities. As the operator for its projects, the Company retains more control over the timing, selection and process of drilling prospects and completion design, which enhances its ability to maximize the return on invested capital and gives greater control over the timing, allocation and amounts of capital expenditures.\nLeasing of Prospective Acreage\nIn the course of our day-to-day business, the Company regularly identifies drilling and development opportunities on additional acreage in its areas of interest that have not yet been leased. Subject to securing additional capital, the Company may take the initiative to lease prospective acreage in our areas of interest and may sell all or any portion of our leased acreage to other companies seeking to participate in the drilling and development of the prospect acreage.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td>29 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGovernment Regulations\nGovernmental Regulation and Environmental Consideration\nThe oil and gas business in the United States is subject to regulation by both federal and state authorities, particularly with respect to pricing, allowable rates of production, marketing and environmental matters. The production of crude oil and gas has, in recent years, been the subject of increasing state and federal controls. No assurance can be given that newly imposed or changed federal laws will not adversely affect the economic viability of any oil and gas properties we currently own and/or may acquire in the future. Federal income and windfall profit\u201d taxes have in the past affected the economic viability of such properties. The following discussion provides a brief overview of potential state and federal regulations. Because Foothills to date has acquired specific properties, and because of the wider range of activities in which the Company expects to participate, management believes that it is not practical currently to set forth in detail the potential impact federal and state regulations may have on our operations.\nThe Department of Energy\nThe Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. No. 95-91) became effective October 1, 1977. Under this Act various agencies, including the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) and the Federal Power Commission (FPC), have been consolidated to constitute the cabinet-level Department of Energy (DOE). The Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA), a semi-independent administration within the DOE, now administers most of the regulatory programs formerly managed by the FEA, including oil pricing and allocation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), an independent agency within the DOE, has assumed the FPC's responsibility for natural gas regulation.\nCrude Oil and Natural Gas Liquids Price and Allocation Regulation\nPursuant to Executive Order Number 12287, issued January 28, 1981, President Reagan lifted all existing federal price and allocation controls over the sale and distribution of crude oil and natural gas liquids. Executive Order Number 12287 was made effective as of January 28, 1981, and consequently, sales of crude oil and natural gas liquids after January 27, 1981 are free from federal regulation. The price for such sales and the supplier-purchaser relationship will be determined by private contract and prevailing market conditions. Because of this action, oil that may be sold by us will be sold at deregulated or free market prices. At various times, certain groups have advocated the reestablishment of regulations and control on the sale of domestic oil and gas.\nState Regulations\nFoothills' production of oil and gas, if any, will be subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we may produce oil and gas. In general, these regulatory authorities are empowered to make and enforce regulations to prevent waste of oil and gas and to protect correlative rights and opportunities to produce oil and gas as between owners of a common reservoir. Some regulatory authorities may also regulate the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production.\nEnvironmental Laws\nOil and gas exploration and development are specifically subject to existing federal and state laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing, or producing oil and gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation.\nAll of our operations involving the exploration for or the production of any minerals are subject to existing laws and regulations relating to exploration procedures, safety precautions, employee health and safety, air quality standards, pollution of streams and fresh water sources, odor, noise, dust, and other environmental protection controls adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as the right of adjoining property owners. We may be required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of minerals may have upon the environment. All requirements imposed by any such authorities may be costly, time consuming, and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations.\nIt may be anticipated that future legislation will significantly emphasize the protection of the environment, and that, as a consequence, our activities may be more closely regulated to further the cause of environmental protection. Such legislation, as well as future interpretation of existing laws, may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs to us and delays, interruptions, or a termination of operations, the extent to which cannot now be predicted.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td>30 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTitle to Properties\nFoothills owns the interest in its properties and also at times relies on contracts with the owner or operator of the property, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company has the right to have its interest placed of record. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we anticipate that a preliminary title examination will be conducted at the time unproved properties or interests are acquired by us. Prior to commencement of drilling operations on such acreage and prior to the acquisition of proved properties, Foothills will conduct a title examination and attempt to cure materially significant defects before proceeding with operations or the acquisition of proved properties, as it may deem appropriate. Foothills properties are subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other interests customary in the industry, liens incident to agreements, current taxes and other burdens, minor encumbrances, easements and restrictions. Foothills' Utah properties acquired from Total Belief Limited on December 30, 2016, are subject to a certain Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA\u201d) Administrative Appeal and a Ute Indian Tribe Global Settlement Agreement, each of which does or may affect title to some, all or none of the properties acquired. Foothills is currently attempting to cure title on these properties, subject to the outcome of the BIA Administrative Appeal, which is still ongoing as of November 14, 2017. To the extent that such defects or disputes exist and cannot be cured, Foothills would suffer title failures, which could result in property valuation impairments and other material adverse consequences to the operations of the Company.\nCorporate Headquarters\nWe are headquartered in Denver, Colorado, where we have 4,295 square feet of corporate office space. Effective May 1, 2017, we signed a 39-month lease for our Denver corporate office. Total rent is approximately $10,051 per month and the Company deems it to be adequate for our current operations.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nWe had revenue of $101,998 for the year ended December 31, 2017, and no revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. We can provide no assurance that we will continue drilling and revenue producing operations or that such drilling and revenue operations, if continued, will be successful.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our management and personnel, and professional fees, such as accounting, consulting and legal. During the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred $3,898,553 and $1,913,265 in selling, general and administrative expenses, $73,979 and $0 in depreciation, depletion and amortization and $1,479,230 and $0 in impairment of oil and gas properties related to abandonment of Labokay, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to the increase of development of newly acquired wells on December 30, 2016.\nChange in Derivative\nLoss on change in derivative for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were $237,387 and $0, respectively. The increase in change in derivative is primarily attributed to new convertible note entered into for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Expenses\nInterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were $874,627 and $27,873, respectively. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributed to new notes entered into for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Income\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were $5,727 and $0, respectively. The increase in other income is primarily attributed to a credit provided by the landlord for an unused allowance for tenant improvements which was contractually allowed to offset monthly rental payments for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDebt forgiveness\nGain on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $48,407 and $0, respectively. The increase in gain on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributed to a legal settlement and accrued interest forgiven under a note which was paid off during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a net loss of $6,407,644 and $1,941,138, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs shown in the accompanying financial statements, we incurred an accumulated loss of $8,382,238 through December 31, 2017, and have a working capital deficit of $13,037,291 at December 31, 2017. The Company is subject to those risks associated with exploration stage companies. The Company has sustained losses since inception and additional debt and equity financing will be required by the Company to fund its development activities and to monetize economically recoverable oil and gas reserves. As such, without additional financing, no assurances can be made that the Company will meet its current obligations in a timely manner, including daily expenses for general and administration costs.\nOn September 30, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to sell 3,007,519 shares of our common stock to a single investor for proceeds totaling $2,000,000.\nOn May 10, 2017, we entered into a convertible note agreement with an unrelated party, pursuant to which we borrowed $50,000 at an annual percentage rate of 10% with a term of 12 months. This note may, at the option of the Lender, be converted at any time prior to September 7, 2017, into fully-paid, restricted and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company at a price equal to 100% of the selling price of such common stock in a private placement to institutional and/or accredited investors initiated by the Company during the term of this note. On October 19, 2017, the Company agreed to extend the allowable conversion period provided under this convertible note until May 10, 2018.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Report. The discussions of results, causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that these results or trends will necessarily occur. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve assumptions, and describe our future plans, strategies, and expectations. Such statements are generally identifiable by use of the words may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d plan,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d intend,\u201d or project\u201d or the negative of these words of other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These statements are expressed in good faith and based upon a reasonable basis when made, but there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved or accomplished.\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions that may not materialize or that may not be accurate. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such factors include, among others: changes in oil or natural gas prices, the success of our drilling program, the timing of planned capital expenditures, availability of acquisitions, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as our ability to access them, the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities, uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business, and the other factors discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus and in other documents that we file with or furnish to the SEC, all of which are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements may include statements about:\n\n 22 \n \n \u25cf competition in the oil and natural gas industry; \u25cf the effectiveness of our risk management and possible future hedging activities; \u25cf environmental liabilities; \u25cf our future operating results; \u25cf estimated future reserves and the present value thereof; and \u25cf our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions contained in this report that are not historical. \nAlthough we believe that the expectations conveyed by the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information available to us on the date such forward-looking statements were made, no assurances can be given as to future results, levels of activity, achievements or financial condition.\nYou should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should recognize that these statements are predictions of future results, which may not occur as anticipated. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements and from historical results, due to the risks and uncertainties described above, as well as others not now anticipated. The impact of any one factor on a particular forward-looking statement is not determinable with certainty as such factors are interdependent upon other factors. The foregoing statements are not exclusive and further information concerning us, including factors that potentially could materially affect our financial results, may emerge from time to time. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements, except as required by law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nUnless otherwise noted, the terms the Company\u201d, Foothills Exploration\u201d, Foothills\u201d, we\u201d, or our\u201d refer to the ongoing business operations of Foothills Exploration, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Foothills Petroleum, Inc., as well as, the past operations of Foothills Petroleum, Inc. The terms Key Link Assets Corp.\u201d or Key Link\u201d refer to the operations of Key Link Assets Corp. prior to May 27, 2016.\nHistory\nFoothills Exploration, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 13, 2010, under the name Key Link Assets Corp.\u201d for the purpose of acquiring a portfolio of heavily discounted real estate properties in the Chicago metropolitan area. The Company changed its focus and planned to acquire small and medium sized grocery stores in non-urban locales that are not directly served by large national supermarket chains.\nOn May 2, 2016, Foothills Petroleum Inc., a Nevada corporation ( FPI\u201d) acquired approximately 14.1 million pre-split (56.4 million post-split) shares of the Company's common stock constituting approximately 96% of our then issued and outstanding shares ( FPI Acquired Shares\u201d). As of May 16, 2016, we effected a 4:1 forward split of our shares of common stock.\nOn May 27, 2016, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with shareholders of FPI whereby we acquired all of the outstanding shares of FPI in exchange for 4,500,000 shares of our common stock and also issued 1,503,759 shares of our common stock on automatic conversion of debt (please see discussion below under Overview) for an aggregate of 6,003,759 shares of our common stock (the Share Exchange\u201d). As a result of the Share Exchange, FPI became our wholly owned subsidiary and the FPI Acquired Shares were returned to treasury and deemed cancelled. For accounting purposes, this transaction is being accounted for as a reverse acquisition and has been treated as a recapitalization of the Company with FPI considered the accounting acquirer, and the financial statements of the accounting acquirer became the financial statements of the registrant. The completion of the Share Exchange resulted in a change of control. The FPI Shareholders obtained approximately 96% of voting control on the date of Share Exchange. FPI was the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Company was the acquired company. The consolidated financial statements after the acquisition include the balance sheets of both companies at historical cost, the historical results of FPI and the results of the Company from the acquisition date. All share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been retroactively restated to reflect the recapitalization.\nPrior to the Share Exchange, we had minimal assets and recognized no revenues from operations, and were accordingly classified as a shell company. On June 24, 2016, we filed an amendment to our Current Report on Form 8-K originally filed on June 10, 2016, indicating that we were no longer a shell company as defined by Rule12b-2 of the Exchange Act. In light of closing of the Share Exchange transaction with FPI, the Company became actively engaged in oil and gas operations through its wholly owned subsidiary.\nOn June 30, 2016, we completed a sale of 3,007,519 shares of our common stock to a single investor for proceeds totaling $2,000,000. For a more complete description of this transaction please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 7, 2016.\nOn August 4, 2016, we were advised that the Financial Industry Regulatory Association had approved (i) our name change from Key Link Assets Corp. to Foothills Exploration, Inc., and (ii) a change of trading symbol from KYLK to FTXP. Please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 9, 2016.\n 23 \n \nOn October 5, 2016, the Company launched its Exploration Division and opened a new office in Houston to support the division's staff. The Company's Exploration Division consists of geologists and petroleum engineers engaged in the exploration and development of hydrocarbons and tasked with building a portfolio of high impact exploration projects in the Gulf Coast region.\nOn December 12, 2016, the Company entered into a participation agreement with Magna Operating, LLC, a privately held Houston-based independent exploration and production company ( Magna Operating\u201d), in relation to the Labokay prospect, covering approximately 240 acres in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. As consideration for an assignment of interest in and to the leases and the prospect, Foothills Petroleum Operating, Inc., a Nevada corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( FPOI\u201d), tendered to Magna Operating the purchase price in the amount of $144,000. This amount covered FPOI's share of the land, lease, and administrative costs that Magna Operating incurred in generating and assembling the Labokay prospect as of November 15, 2016. As further consideration for an assignment of working interest in and to the leases, FPOI agreed to participate in the cost, risk, and expense of drilling the Labokay test well. The well was plugged and abandoned in February 2017. The Company has no immediate plans to engage in further exploration and development activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.\nOn December 30, 2016, the Company acquired various oil and gas assets in Utah from Total Belief Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of New Times Energy Corporation Limited. These assets included certain oil and gas wells throughout the Uinta Basin in Utah on acreage with over 30 proven undeveloped drilling locations, additional non-operating interest in other leases, and access to approximately 6,000 acres in the Uinta Basin with proven and probable reserves and existing infrastructure in place. Through the acquisition, Foothills also obtained six shut-in wells in the Natural Buttes Field, Utah. The transaction provides Foothills with the rights to an agreement to acquire up to 6,000+ acres and up to 16 shut-in oil and gas wells with proved and proved undeveloped reserves on Tribal lands in the Uinta Basin. This acquisition delivers to the Company an additional 40% working interest in the Ladysmith Prospect covering 3,060 acres in the Greater Green River Basin, Wyoming, bringing the Company's total working interest in the prospect from 35% (pre-acquisition) up to 75%.\nBy this agreement, the Company acquired 13,166,667 shares, constituting 55.63% of the outstanding shares of Grey Hawk Exploration, Inc. ( Grey Hawk\u201d), a British Columbia, Canada company. Grey Hawk owns a non-operated working interest in two non-producing wells in the southern portion of the Natural Buttes Field.\nOn December 30, 2016, the Company also acquired the remaining 25% membership interest in Tiger Energy Partners International, LLC ( TEPI\u201d) from Green Stone Capital Partners Limited, a Cayman Islands limited liability company, in exchange for assumption of Greenstone's proportionate share of TEPI obligations and liabilities.\nOn May 10, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement (PSA), with an undisclosed seller, to acquire 67,330 gross acres (49,600 net acres) held by production in Utah and Colorado. This acquisition was anticipated to close by or before June 30, 2017, such closing being subject to traditional representations, warranties, covenants and adjustments including, but not limited to lien releases, cures of any defective title matters, satisfaction of leases and amendments thereto. In August 2017, the parties by mutual agreement terminated the PSA.\nOn October 19, 2017, the Company announced the acquisition of 21% working interest in two horizontal gas wells in the Uinta Basin from an undisclosed party. Both wells are operated by EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EOG). We expect total cost for our 21% working interest in both wells will be $3.2 million. These wells align with the Company's overall growth strategy for the Basin and provides us with the ability to gain insight from a world-class operator. In February 2018, the Company announced the successful drilling, completion and flow testing of the Stagecoach 111-20H and Stagecoach 117-20H horizontal wells, both of which are now producing natural gas in commercial quantities. Both wells have been online since late December 2017 and production tubing is expected to be set in the near term. These two successful horizontal wells will generate production and net cash flow for the Company and are expected to payout within 30 months. As of December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $1,501,377 cost for our shares of interest.\nOverview\nFoothills Exploration is an independent oil and gas exploration company engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties, mainly through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Foothills Petroleum, Inc. ( FPI\u201d). FPI is focused on acquiring producing and developmental properties in the Rockies. FPI seeks to acquire non-core, dislocated and underdeveloped oil and gas assets and maximize those assets to create shareholder value (the Business\u201d).\nOn December 31, 2015, FPI acquired the rights to 38,120 acres of oil and gas property in the state of Wyoming, through Foothills Exploration, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary acquired by FPI upon its organization in December 2015.\nThe Company's principal obligations include:\n \u25cf A debenture in the amount of $1,250,000, plus interest accruing at a rate of 9% per annum issued to Berwin Trading Limited ( Berwin\u201d) with principal and interest due upon maturity on May 6, 2017. On May 5, 2017, the Company and Berwin agreed to extend the maturity date of the debenture to June 20, 2017, in return for an annual interest rate increase from 9% to 13.5% per annum for the life of the debenture. On November 3, 2017, Berwin agreed to defer repayment of this note to a later date, and acknowledged that the Company is not in default regarding this Debenture. Berwin also reaffirmed its belief that the Company will either extend or repay the obligation to their satisfaction. As partial consideration for the deferment, the Company agreed to issue Berwin 100,000 shares of its restricted common stock, valued at $48,000. The issuance of the shares in exchange for the maturity extension was treated as a modification of existing debt pursuant to the guidance of ASC 470-50 Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d ( ASC 470-50\u201d). On February 28, 2018, Berwin and the Company agreed to extend the maturity date of the debenture to June 30, 2018, and as consideration for the extension, the Company agreed to compensate Berwin with 250,000 shares of restricted common stock. In addition, the parties agreed that if payment of said principal and interest due and payable is made late, then a penalty payment of $125,000 shall become due and payable to Berwin by the Company. \u25cf A second debenture in the amount of $1,000,000, plus interest accruing at a rate of 9% issued to Full Wealth Investment Hong Kong Limited ( Full Wealth\u201d) with principal and interest due upon maturity on or before May 5, 2017. On May 18, 2017, Full Wealth sold this note to Gold Class Limited, with accrued interest increased from 9% to 13.5% per annum for the life of the debenture. On June 1, 2017, Full Wealth acquired this note back from Gold Class and the Company issued a new debenture with a 60-day term and 10% interest per annum to Full Wealth. On August 14, 2017, we repaid $1,000,000 in principal and $20,000 in accrued interest and recorded remaining accrued interest in amount of $30,000 as gain on debt forgiveness. \u25cf A promissory note in the amount of $6,000,000 to Total Belief Limited ( TBL\u201d), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of New Times Energy Corporation Limited, issued in connection with the assets acquired on December 30, 2016, with a maturity date of June 30, 2018. This promissory note recites that it accrues no interest during its term and is due and payable in full on or before its maturity date. Foothills recorded $342,804 imputed interest as debt discount. This amount of $342,804 was determined using the present value method based on the following assumptions: (i) adjusted interest rate 4% (ii) expected life of 1.5 years. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we amortized $228,536 debt discount into interest expense. The Company has reduced the value of its oil and gas properties in the proportion of the debt discount allocated to the Note. \u25cf A convertible promissory note in amount of $50,000 was issued to an unrelated party on May 10, 2017, bearing an annual percentage rate of 10% with a term of 12 months, which is due on May 10, 2018. This note may, at the option of the lender, be converted at any time prior to September 7, 2017, into fully-paid, restricted and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company at a price equal to 100% of the selling price of such common stock in a private placement to institutional and/or accredited investors initiated by the Company during the term of this note. On October 19, 2017, the Company agreed to extend the allowable conversion period provided under this convertible note until May 10, 2018. On November 7, 2017, the Company issued 50,000 warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a strike price of $1.00 per share expiring on May 7, 2019. If the Company fails to pay the principal and accrued unpaid interest due and payable to Lender on or before the due date of the convertible note, then the Lender shall be provided the right to convert at either $0.665 per share or upon the same terms offered in FirstFire Opportunity Fund, LLC Note's conversion options. The relative fair value of warrant was determined to be $3,381 on November 7, 2017, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: (i) volatility rate of 77%, (ii) discount rate of 0%, (iii) zero expected dividend yield, and (iv) expected life of 1.5 years. At December 31, 2017, $50,000 of principal was outstanding under the Note. The issuance of the warrants in exchange for the maturity extension was treated as a modification of existing debt pursuant to the guidance of ASC 470-50 Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d ( ASC 470-50\u201d). \u25cf A promissory note to Profit Well Limited, a Hong Kong limited liability company, issued on August 9, 2017, in the amount of $1,050,000. The promissory note bears an annual interest rate of 13.5% and was initially payable on September 8, 2017. The Company received the funds under the foregoing note on August 10, 2017. The funds received pursuant to the Note principally have been used to repay the Full Wealth debenture, dated June 1, 2017. On November 3, 2017, Profit Well Limited agreed to defer repayment of this note to a later date, and acknowledged that the Company is not in default regarding this Debenture. Profit Well Limited also reaffirmed its belief that the Company will either extend or repay the obligation to their satisfaction. As partial consideration for the deferment, the Company agreed to issue Profit Well Limited 100,000 shares of its restricted common stock, valued at $48,000. The issuance of the shares in exchange for the maturity extension was treated as a modification of existing debt pursuant to the guidance of ASC 470-50 Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d ( ASC 470-50\u201d). On February 28, 2018, Profit Well and the Company agreed to extend the maturity date of the debenture to June 30, 2018, and as consideration for the extension, the Company agreed to compensate Profit Well with 200,000 shares of restricted common stock. In addition, the parties agreed that if payment of said principal and interest due and payable is made late, then a penalty payment of $100,000 shall become due and payable to Profit Well by the Company. \u25cf A promissory note and three tranches of warrants issued on September 29, 2017, to an unaffiliated investor for an aggregate consideration of $250,000. This promissory note recites that it accrues no interest if paid when due and is due and payable on January 2, 2018. The obligations under the promissory note were personally guaranteed by Kevin J. Sylla, Executive Chairman of the Company. If principal is not paid on or before January 2, 2018, interest will accrue at the rate of 15% per year until paid. On November 6, 2017, the Company agreed to compensate the investor 75,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock in connection with a more favorable term of a note entered with FirstFire Opportunity Fund, LLC. On December 30, 2017, the Company and the investor agreed to extend the maturity date of this Note to January 23, 2018, in return for a payment at maturity of the principal, accrued interest as provided in the Note, plus 30,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock. Because the fair value of the shares was greater than 10% of the present value of the remaining cash flows under the Note, the issuance of the shares in connection with a more favorable term of a note entered with FirstFire Opportunity Fund, LLC. was treated as a debt extinguishment and reissuance of a new debt instrument pursuant to the guidance of ASC 470-50 Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d ( ASC 470-50\u201d). Since January 23, 2018, the Company and the investor have been in ongoing discussions to extend the term of this Note. On March 28, 2018, the investor acknowledged that the Company is not in default regarding this Note and reaffirmed its belief that the Company will either extend the Note's due date or repay its obligation on terms that are mutually satisfactory. \n 24 \n \nThe warrants have the following terms:\n \u25cf 375,000 warrants to purchase 375,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a strike price of $0.665 per share expiring on September 29, 2019, \u25cf 375,000 warrants to purchase 375,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a strike price of $1.25 per share expiring on September 29, 2020, \u25cf 185,000 warrants to purchase 185,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a strike price of $2.00 per share expiring on September 29, 2020. \nThe aggregate relative fair value of three tranches of warrants was determined to be $105,000 on September 29, 2017, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: (i) volatility rate of 94%, (ii) discount rate of 0%, (iii) zero expected dividend yield, and (iv) expected life of 2-3 years. $2,536 imputed interest was recorded as debt discount. $2,536 was determined using the present value method based on the following assumptions: (i) adjusted interest rate 4% (ii) expected life of 0.26 year. The aggregate value of the warrants and imputed interest of $107,536 was considered as debt discount upon issuance and will be amortized as interest over the term of the Note or in full upon the conversion of the Note. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company amortized $105,272 of such discount to interest expense, and the unamortized discount as of December 31, 2017 was $2,264. At December 31, 2017, $250,000 of principal was outstanding under the Note.\nEach tranche of warrants is subject to down round adjustment provisions if the Company during the term of that tranche issues additional securities for consideration per share, after giving effect to fees, commission and expenses, that is less, or which on conversion or exercise of the underlying security is less, than $0.665 per share (as adjusted for any change resulting from forward or reverse splits, stock dividends and similar events).\nTo satisfy most favored nation provisions in previously entered securities purchase agreements that are triggered by the transaction described above, Company issued 136,015 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 136,015 shares of common stock, in the aggregate, to certain investors who purchased units from the Company, at a $1.00 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share and one warrant. See the Company's Current Report on the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 5, 2017. Of this amount, 100,752 shares and warrants to purchase 100,752 shares of common stock will be issued to Wilshire Energy Partners LLC, an entity controlled by Kevin J. Sylla. The exercise price of these investor warrants was adjusted to $0.665 per share. We measured the value of the effect of the down round feature as the difference between the fair value of the financial instrument at an original exercise price of $1.50 and an adjusted exercise price of $0.665 and, as a result, $59,801 was recorded as down round feature as interest expense under ASC 260-10-30-1. Foothills determined the amount of $59,801 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: (i) volatility rate of 94%, (ii) discount rate of 0%, (iii) zero expected dividend yield, and (iv) expected life of 3 years.\n \u25cf A convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $267,500, with net proceeds of $250,000 before giving effect to certain transactional costs including legal fees, was issued to FirstFire Opportunity Fund, LLC, on November 17, 2017. As part of this transaction the Company also issued: \n\n The convertible note accrues interest of 8% per annum and is due and payable on August 17, 2018. The warrants are subject to adjustment in certain events such as forward or reverse stock splits or if subsequent financings are at terms that are more favorable to persons in subsequent issuances of securities. The convertible note agreements give the lender the right to convert the loan amounts due into common stock at a conversion price of $0.665 per share, subject to adjustment under certain events, and the Company has the option but not the obligation to repay the outstanding principal of the convertible note, in whole or in part, within six months from the closing date, by paying 115% of the principal amount then owing, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to avoid conversion under the convertible agreements. The convertible note may not be prepaid from 180 days after closing until maturity and is secured by a personal guaranty from the Company's Executive Chairman, Kevin Sylla. The net proceeds of the convertible note will be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. No broker-dealer or placement agent was retained or involved in this transaction. See 8-K report filed with the SEC on November 17, 2017 for more information. \u25cf A promissory note was issued on November 1, 2017, to the Law Offices of Aaron A. Grunfeld or its successors or assigns (the Holder\u201d), the Company's outside general counsel, for a principal amount of $120,628.95 in exchange of legal services rendered, bearing an interest rate of 12% per annum and with a maturity date of June 30, 2018. \nFrom its inception in December 2015 through December 31, 2017, Foothills generated $101,998 in revenue from its principal business operations and is currently still an exploration stage company. Prior to January 2016, Foothills' operations were focused mainly on administrative activities connected to the identification and evaluation of potential oil and gas prospects and other potential leasehold acquisitions in our geographical areas of interest.\n 25 \n \nOn December 30, 2016, the Company acquired various oil and gas assets in Utah from a subsidiary of New Times Energy Corporation Limited ( New Times\u201d). These assets included certain oil and gas wells throughout the Uinta Basin in Utah, on acreage with over 30 proven undeveloped drilling locations, additional non-operating interest in other leases, and access to approximately 6,000 acres in the Uinta Basin with proven and probable reserves and existing infrastructure in place. This purchase provides the Company with an entry point into the Uinta Basin and a basis from which to seek other bolt-on acquisition opportunities in the Rockies. The transaction delivers to the Company a licensed and bonded operator in Utah having bonds in place with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), State of Utah and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).\nThrough this acquisition from New Times, the Company also obtained six shut-in wells in the Natural Buttes Field, Utah. After the acquisition, these wells were worked over and brought back online with production averaging around 183 barrels per month in Q2 2017. The Company plans to work over the remaining three wells in the coming months.\nThe transaction provided the Company with the rights to an agreement to acquire up to 6,000+ acres and up to 16 shut-in oil and gas wells with proved and proved undeveloped reserves on Ute Tribal lands in the Uinta Basin. These properties provide in-field drilling potential, the ability to bring online shut-in wells and behind pipe development. Five shut-in wells located on fee lands in the Altamont-Bluebell Field that are undergoing title curative have the potential to achieve near term production with stimulation and the addition of surface equipment.\nFurthermore, this acquisition delivered to the Company an additional 40% working interest in the Ladysmith Prospect, covering 3,060 acres in the Greater Green River Basin, Wyoming, increasing the Company's pre-acquisition working interest of 35% up to a total of 75%.\nLastly, through this acquisition, the Company also acquired 13,166,667 shares of common stock, constituting 55.63% of the outstanding shares of Grey Hawk Exploration, Inc. ( Grey Hawk\u201d), a British Columbia, Canada company. Grey Hawk owns a non-operated working interest in two wells in the southern portion of the Greater Natural Buttes Field in Utah. These two wells are not currently producing.\nTo acquire these assets, the Company paid a total consideration of $10.75 million in a combination of cash, stock and promissory note consisting of:\n \u25cf $750,000 cash; \u25cf 2,083,334 shares of the Company's restricted common stock valued by the parties at $4,000,000 at an agreed upon price per share of $1.92; and a \u25cf Promissory note in the principal amount of $6,000,000 due and payable in full 18 months from December 30, 2016 and accruing no interest during its term. \nFor financial accounting purposes the 2,083,334 shares were valued at the closing market price on the day of the transaction, which was $1.83, accordingly the shares were presented at a value of $3,812,501 on the Company's financial statements on December 30, 2016.\nOur financial statements reflect that our current liabilities exceed our current assets and it is possible that the historical value of the assets that we record on our books may not be attained on a sale or other disposition for cash. We require substantial additional operating capital to maintain current operations and to implement even a portion of our identified acquisitions and workovers. Additional capital, if available at all, will likely be on onerous terms that are also dilutive to our shareholders. No assurance can be given that we will obtain any additional capital. As a consequence, an investment in our shares or other securities is extremely speculative and may result in a complete loss of your investment.\nMarket Environment\nThe U.S. energy markets continued to see improved fundamentals for both crude oil and natural gas markets during 3Q17, as prices remained in a tight range for both products and volatility at the low end of the range relative to historic averages. Looking ahead at the remainder of the year and into 2018, we believe the U.S. energy markets are poised for a major price move for both crude oil and natural gas prices as well as a significant uptick in price volatility. Our bias remains moderately bullish for both WTI and natural gas prices going forward and we are looking for a breakout above the current trading ranges that has dominated year-to-date.\nOil - As disclosed in our previous Form 10-Q Quarterly Report for period ended June 30, 2017, OPEC and Non-OPEC producing nations' production cuts announced earlier in the year have reportedly begun to reduce global oil supplies. We are now seeing that in the global pricing structure as Brent crude oil price is now trading at roughly a $6 premium to the WTI crude oil price. We believe that the catalyst for the widening spread is twofold: 1) U.S. shale production continued to grow reportedly reaching 9.2 million barrels per day, its highest level since November 2015 and 2) global oil supplies reportedly are falling, highlighted by a 14.2 million barrel drop in August 2017. We believe that when Brent trades at a $4 premium or greater to WTI, U.S. oil becomes a more attractive export, resulting in greater U.S. oil exports in 2017. We expect that this trend likely may continue in 2018. In short, robust U.S. oil exports coupled with strong U.S. demand for refined products, should accelerate in our view the decline rate for U.S. oil supplies and be supportive of oil prices moving forward.\n 26 \n \nGlobal demand for crude oil continues to grow at a steady pace. The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its most recent monthly oil market report for October 2017 forecasted global demand for crude oil growing by 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and by 1.4 million bpd in 2018. The IEA also estimates that global oil demand will reach 100.0 million barrels per day in Q4 2018, which would set a record that in our view will become a key psychological level for the oil markets. In the U.S., the IEA forecasts gasoline demand will average 9.3 million barrels per day in 2017, and 9.4 million barrels per day in 2018, an annual increase of 1%. Reported global demand for oil and refined products are at or near record levels, which is alleviating the supply overhang and in our view supporting a bullish outlook heading into the end of the year and into 2018.\nNatural Gas - After being in a bear market for nearly a decade, we believe that commodity fundamentals have significantly improved over the course of 2017 to date. With LNG exports and exports to Mexico reportedly at record levels, the U.S. appears slated to become a net exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1957. We expect U.S. dry gas production to be roughly 71 BCF per day in 2017, while demand and export growth should average about 76 BCF per day. Given this, the natural gas storage glut has been significantly reduced with current storage levels now at the trailing 5-year average as we head into the heating/withdrawal season. A stronger-than-expected heating season driven by colder than average temperatures in key heating regions could send natural gas prices above $4.00 MMBtu.\nOur Strategy\nFoothills' strategic objective is to build a portfolio of producing properties that have relatively low operating costs, long lived reserves and upside development potential. The Company's goal is to build a land bank of over 200,000 acres of proven, probable and prospective reserves during this period of relatively low commodity pricing. Foothills intends to accomplish this by acquiring oil and gas properties with attractive valuation metrics and attractive geological risk/reward profiles that are well positioned to benefit from an improvement in commodity prices. No assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve this objective.\nThe Company's primary focus is the Rocky Mountain region, where its consultants and technical staff have conducted oil and gas operations and collectively have in our view developed significantly material operating experience. Management believes that the Company's tight geographical focus and regional experience, coupled with our strategic industry relationships may advantageously position Foothills to acquire high quality oil and gas assets at attractive valuations in the current environment.\nThe Company's acquisitions and roll up strategy is based on identifying undercapitalized, yet attractive oil and gas assets selling at what we anticipate to be a discount to intrinsic value. Foothills focuses on acquiring oil and gas assets that have existing production, with existing infrastructure in place and future developmental potential. Once we acquire oil and gas assets, management expects to target adjacent oil and gas properties with similar characteristics for bolt on acquisitions to increase our geographical acreage position. By consolidating and exploiting additional acreage as part of its rollup strategy, management intends to achieve operating efficiencies to maximize shareholder value.\nWyoming Properties\nThe principal Wyoming assets owned by the Company currently consist of non-producing, yet prospective mineral leases in the Ladysmith project.\nLadysmith Project\nFoothills owns a 75% working interest in the Ladysmith Anticline prospect that is located in Fremont County, Wyoming. Total acreage position is 3,061 acres located between the Great Divide/Greater Green River Basin and the Wind River Basin. The primary target zones are the variable Phosphoria and Tensleep sandstone with secondary considerations in the Madison limestone and Flathead sandstone. The prospect generation was based on licensed 2-D seismic comprising of two seismic lines covering the Chevron/Echo - Greater Green River Basin. Foothills' has conducted two BLM onsite inspections to date and work continues on a surface access use agreement, completion of drilling unit outline and a schedule for BLM area and depth meeting in the near term. Spring conditions will soon enable Foothills to gain access to prospect area and commence Right of Way (ROW) application, surveying and archeology study. Additional BLM acreage acquisition and federal unit formation are continued processes, with detailed development plans for surface use being formulated.\nSprings Project\nDuring Q4 2017, the Company allowed the BLM leases for the Springs project to expire without paying additional delay rental payments. The primary terms on these leases were due to expire in Q4 2018 and management did not feel it was in the best interest of the Company stakeholders to continue its exploratory efforts on a speculative, wildcat play. As such, Management made a business decision to reduce the Company's portfolio of exploration plays and instead continue seeking lower-risk acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties rather than take additional wildcat drilling risk on this prospect. As such, the Company no longer owns the mineral rights for this project. As the result, the Company recognized impairment of oil and gas property in amount of $150,593, during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n 27 \n \nPaw Paw Project\nThe Paw Paw project is a 3-D seismic defined prospect, which covers 4,467 acres and is a direct analog to the highly productive Tensleep Formation Enigma\u201d Field (EUR 3.7 million barrels of oil) located only two miles to the south. The Tensleep Formation has a history of prolific area production with two nearby analogues. The Paw Paw project has potential from primary and secondary recovery of up to 2 million barrels of oil. On December 11, 2016, the Company completed drilling operations on the Paw Paw Federal #1 test well. The Big Horn County Wyoming test well reached total depth in the Madison Formation and the Company successfully logged and acquired valid data to further evaluate the project's potential. The Company's technical team and consulting geological firm, Geopinion\u00ae Inc., is continuing to evaluate test well results and further interpret and analyze 3D seismic data in order to identify favorable potential future locations for possible commercial wells. The test well has been temporarily abandoned while the parties continue to analyze results during the evaluation stage.\nThe Paw Paw Federal #1 test well reached total depth in the Madison Formation after drilling an anticipated stratigraphic section and thrust fault. Oil shows were found in the Muddy, Phosphoria, and Madison formations. The Phosphoria is a regionally productive formation and could end up being the secondary zone in sidetrack operations should that type of operation be deemed commercially economic. Upon evaluation of the test well's seismic structural position and analysis of modern well log data, the technical team has determined that a successful sidetrack operation is likely to yield commercial oil reserves from the Tensleep and any other sands with oil shows and concurred that the test well, which is temporarily abandoned, should be considered for re-entry. The Company intends to sidetrack this well with the objective of eventually completing this well to produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons from the target formation. We encountered a fault while drilling the well, which required additional geological and engineering work. The Company has since mapped out the issue and intends to continue drilling operations. The Company has deferred recommencing drilling operations because certain lease title issues were encountered during the period of geological discovery, which the Company is currently working to mend. The Company intends to recommence continuous operations with the objective of sidetracking this well to produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons from the target formation during Q3 2018, once certain wildlife stipulations affecting oil and gas operations on the BLM lands surrounding this well come to an end. No assurance can be given that these precise efforts by our experienced technical team and our further development efforts of the prospect, including further drilling activity, will yield a commercially successful well.\nIronwood Project\nThe Company had intended to drill a test well on the Ironwood prospect during the first half of 2017 but was unable to do so within the agreement term and as such, the Company failed to earn into this prospect to hold the acreage from current production and no longer has any rights to this project. During the second half of 2017 Management decided to focus its full attention on acquiring and developing properties with existing reserves and infield development opportunities rather than take additional wildcat drilling risk on any prospect.\nUtah Properties\nTiger Energy Operating, LLC\nTiger Energy Operating, LLC, ( TEO\u201d) is a licensed and bonded oil and gas operator in the state of Utah. TEO is the operator of record for a total of six oil and gas wells situated on 280 acres in the Duck Creek area of the Altamont Bluebell field. In late 2015 and early 2016 these wells were shut-in due to financial issues with the previous owner. During the calendar year 2017, the Company sold a total of approximately 2,137 barrels of oil, which were produced from three of its Duck Creek wells. The Company has developed a Duck Creek optimization program and needs to raise approximately $900,000 to complete workover operations on these wells, which are expected to increase total production to approximately 210 barrels of oil per day. Management anticipates obtaining the necessary capital enabling the Company to implement this workover program during the current fiscal year. TEO has cash and surety bonds in place with the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Utah Department of Natural Resources Division of Oil, Gas and Mining that are valued at about $295,000.\nTiger Energy Partners International, LLC\nTiger Energy Partners International, LLC, ( TEPI\u201d) owns all rights and interests pertaining to the Global Settlement Agreement ( GSA\u201d) for the Uintah and Ouray Reservation between Mountain Oil & Gas, Inc. and the MOG Entities (Craig Phillips) and the Ute Indian Tribe (the Tribe\u201d) of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, dated December 22, 2014. TEPI also owns all rights and interests acquired in the Purchase and Sale Agreements between TEPI and Mountain Oil & Gas, Inc. dated April 16, 2012, and December 18, 2012. TEPI expects to move forward with this transaction in 2018 via a revised Global Settlement Agreement with the parties to said agreement. The Company is bound by confidentiality provisions in the GSA and as such is prohibited from disclosing any additional details.\n 28 \n \nTiger Energy Mineral Leasing, LLC\nTiger Energy Mineral Leasing, LLC ( TEML\u201d) owns certain non-operating working interests, which were previously operated by Rig II, LLC. In 2017, Rig II, LLC, sold its operating rights in said leases to Crescent Point Energy Corp. (NYSE: CPG), who is the current operator of record for these leases. The Company realized approximately $4,532 in total net revenues during 2017 from this non-operated working interest. In addition, TEML also owns a 40% working interest, in the Ladysmith prospect, which increases the Company's total working interest in this prospect to 75%. TEML also owns all rights and interests pertaining to the Rio Capital Acquisition dated September 25, 2014, pertaining to oil and gas leases in the Altamont-Bluebell field located in Duchesne and Uintah Counties, Utah.\nGulf Coast Properties\nOn December 15, 2016, the Company announced a Participation Agreement with Magna Operating, LLC, in relation to the Labokay prospect, covering 240 acres in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana.\nLabokay Prospect\nLabokay is an amplitude versus offset\u201d ( AVO\u201d) oil play in Southwestern Louisiana targeting the Frio Nododaria Blanpiedi Sand. On February 14, 2017, the Company announced that it had reached total depth in its Labokay Prospect well located in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. The well was drilled to a total measured depth of 8,795 feet where hydrocarbon shows were present, but not in commercial quantities to warrant completion. The well has been plugged and abandoned as required. The Company estimates well costs incurred or to be incurred for the Labokay at approximately $1.3 million, including plugging and abandonment liability.\nThe Company has no immediate plans to engage in further exploration and development activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.\nPlan of Operations\nCurrent energy prices have exposed attractive U.S. based assets that are poorly capitalized and neglected, which are now selling at discounted prices, providing multiple entry points to acquire attractive oil and gas assets. Foothills intends to acquire dislocated and non-core oil and gas assets from larger exploration and production companies.\nFoothills is focused on acquiring and rolling up smaller operators in a considerably fragmented oil and gas market and through consolidation, management believes Foothills can effectively scale its production and acreage position and collectively unlock value in the acquired oil and gas assets to create shareholder value. No assurance can be given that the Company will acquire adequate cash or other resources to be able to attain any of these objectives.\nAcquiring additional assets and companies in the Rockies\nThe Company is targeting acquisitions in a tightly defined geographical area of interest, which meet certain metrics and future development potential. The Company anticipates that these acquisitions will be funded through the sale of common stock, debt and cash generated from the Company's financing activities, including public, private and possible institutional offerings in capital market transactions and future reserve based lending activities. Subject to the securing of additional capital, the Company anticipates making additional bolt-on acquisitions of producing properties, which can potentially be leveraged and optimized by applying its technical capabilities and improving operational efficiencies. Although the Company is currently evaluating several prospective acquisitions, which meet its criteria, no assurance can be given that it will be successful in any of these endeavors.\nRetain Operational Control and Significant Working Interest\nIn its principal acquisition and development targets, the Company aims to preserve operational control of its development and drilling activities. As the operator for its projects, the Company retains more control over the timing, selection and process of drilling prospects and completion design, which enhances its ability to maximize the return on invested capital and gives greater control over the timing, allocation and amounts of capital expenditures.\nLeasing of Prospective Acreage\nIn the course of our day-to-day business, the Company regularly identifies drilling and development opportunities on additional acreage in its areas of interest that have not yet been leased. Subject to securing additional capital, the Company may take the initiative to lease prospective acreage in our areas of interest and may sell all or any portion of our leased acreage to other companies seeking to participate in the drilling and development of the prospect acreage.\n 29 \n \nGovernment Regulations\nGovernmental Regulation and Environmental Consideration\nThe oil and gas business in the United States is subject to regulation by both federal and state authorities, particularly with respect to pricing, allowable rates of production, marketing and environmental matters. The production of crude oil and gas has, in recent years, been the subject of increasing state and federal controls. No assurance can be given that newly imposed or changed federal laws will not adversely affect the economic viability of any oil and gas properties we currently own and/or may acquire in the future. Federal income and windfall profit\u201d taxes have in the past affected the economic viability of such properties. The following discussion provides a brief overview of potential state and federal regulations. Because Foothills to date has acquired specific properties, and because of the wider range of activities in which the Company expects to participate, management believes that it is not practical currently to set forth in detail the potential impact federal and state regulations may have on our operations.\nThe Department of Energy\nThe Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. No. 95-91) became effective October 1, 1977. Under this Act various agencies, including the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) and the Federal Power Commission (FPC), have been consolidated to constitute the cabinet-level Department of Energy (DOE). The Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA), a semi-independent administration within the DOE, now administers most of the regulatory programs formerly managed by the FEA, including oil pricing and allocation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), an independent agency within the DOE, has assumed the FPC's responsibility for natural gas regulation.\nCrude Oil and Natural Gas Liquids Price and Allocation Regulation\nPursuant to Executive Order Number 12287, issued January 28, 1981, President Reagan lifted all existing federal price and allocation controls over the sale and distribution of crude oil and natural gas liquids. Executive Order Number 12287 was made effective as of January 28, 1981, and consequently, sales of crude oil and natural gas liquids after January 27, 1981 are free from federal regulation. The price for such sales and the supplier-purchaser relationship will be determined by private contract and prevailing market conditions. Because of this action, oil that may be sold by us will be sold at deregulated or free market prices. At various times, certain groups have advocated the reestablishment of regulations and control on the sale of domestic oil and gas.\nState Regulations\nFoothills' production of oil and gas, if any, will be subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we may produce oil and gas. In general, these regulatory authorities are empowered to make and enforce regulations to prevent waste of oil and gas and to protect correlative rights and opportunities to produce oil and gas as between owners of a common reservoir. Some regulatory authorities may also regulate the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production.\nEnvironmental Laws\nOil and gas exploration and development are specifically subject to existing federal and state laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing, or producing oil and gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation.\nAll of our operations involving the exploration for or the production of any minerals are subject to existing laws and regulations relating to exploration procedures, safety precautions, employee health and safety, air quality standards, pollution of streams and fresh water sources, odor, noise, dust, and other environmental protection controls adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as the right of adjoining property owners. We may be required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of minerals may have upon the environment. All requirements imposed by any such authorities may be costly, time consuming, and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations.\nIt may be anticipated that future legislation will significantly emphasize the protection of the environment, and that, as a consequence, our activities may be more closely regulated to further the cause of environmental protection. Such legislation, as well as future interpretation of existing laws, may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs to us and delays, interruptions, or a termination of operations, the extent to which cannot now be predicted.\n 30 \n \nTitle to Properties\nFoothills owns the interest in its properties and also at times relies on contracts with the owner or operator of the property, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company has the right to have its interest placed of record. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we anticipate that a preliminary title examination will be conducted at the time unproved properties or interests are acquired by us. Prior to commencement of drilling operations on such acreage and prior to the acquisition of proved properties, Foothills will conduct a title examination and attempt to cure materially significant defects before proceeding with operations or the acquisition of proved properties, as it may deem appropriate. Foothills properties are subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other interests customary in the industry, liens incident to agreements, current taxes and other burdens, minor encumbrances, easements and restrictions. Foothills' Utah properties acquired from Total Belief Limited on December 30, 2016, are subject to a certain Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA\u201d) Administrative Appeal and a Ute Indian Tribe Global Settlement Agreement, each of which does or may affect title to some, all or none of the properties acquired. Foothills is currently attempting to cure title on these properties, subject to the outcome of the BIA Administrative Appeal, which is still ongoing as of November 14, 2017. To the extent that such defects or disputes exist and cannot be cured, Foothills would suffer title failures, which could result in property valuation impairments and other material adverse consequences to the operations of the Company.\nCorporate Headquarters\nWe are headquartered in Denver, Colorado, where we have 4,295 square feet of corporate office space. Effective May 1, 2017, we signed a 39-month lease for our Denver corporate office. Total rent is approximately $10,051 per month and the Company deems it to be adequate for our current operations.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nWe had revenue of $101,998 for the year ended December 31, 2017, and no revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. We can provide no assurance that we will continue drilling and revenue producing operations or that such drilling and revenue operations, if continued, will be successful.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our management and personnel, and professional fees, such as accounting, consulting and legal. During the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred $3,898,553 and $1,913,265 in selling, general and administrative expenses, $73,979 and $0 in depreciation, depletion and amortization and $1,479,230 and $0 in impairment of oil and gas properties related to abandonment of Labokay, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to the increase of development of newly acquired wells on December 30, 2016.\nChange in Derivative\nLoss on change in derivative for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were $237,387 and $0, respectively. The increase in change in derivative is primarily attributed to new convertible note entered into for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Expenses\nInterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were $874,627 and $27,873, respectively. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributed to new notes entered into for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Income\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were $5,727 and $0, respectively. The increase in other income is primarily attributed to a credit provided by the landlord for an unused allowance for tenant improvements which was contractually allowed to offset monthly rental payments for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDebt forgiveness\nGain on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $48,407 and $0, respectively. The increase in gain on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributed to a legal settlement and accrued interest forgiven under a note which was paid off during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n 31 \n \nNet Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a net loss of $6,407,644 and $1,941,138, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs shown in the accompanying financial statements, we incurred an accumulated loss of $8,382,238 through December 31, 2017, and have a working capital deficit of $13,037,291 at December 31, 2017. The Company is subject to those risks associated with exploration stage companies. The Company has sustained losses since inception and additional debt and equity financing will be required by the Company to fund its development activities and to monetize economically recoverable oil and gas reserves. As such, without additional financing, no assurances can be made that the Company will meet its current obligations in a timely manner, including daily expenses for general and administration costs.\nOn September 30, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to sell 3,007,519 shares of our common stock to a single investor for proceeds totaling $2,000,000.\nOn May 10, 2017, we entered into a convertible note agreement with an unrelated party, pursuant to which we borrowed $50,000 at an annual percentage rate of 10% with a term of 12 months. This note may, at the option of the Lender, be converted at any time prior to September 7, 2017, into fully-paid, restricted and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company at a price equal to 100% of the selling price of such common stock in a private placement to institutional and/or accredited investors initiated by the Company during the term of this note. On October 19, 2017, the Company agreed to extend the allowable conversion period provided under this convertible note until May 10, 2018. On November 7, 2017, the", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Report. The discussions of results, causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that these results or trends will necessarily occur. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve assumptions, and describe our future plans, strategies, and expectations. Such statements are generally identifiable by use of the words may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d plan,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d intend,\u201d or project\u201d or the negative of these words of other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These statements are expressed in good faith and based upon a reasonable basis when made, but there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved or accomplished.\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions that may not materialize or that may not be accurate. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such factors include, among others: changes in oil or natural gas prices, the success of our drilling program, the timing of planned capital expenditures, availability of acquisitions, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as our ability to access them, the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities, uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business, and the other factors discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus and in other documents that we file with or furnish to the SEC, all of which are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements may include statements about:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our business strategy; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our reserves or reserves that we may expect to develop; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our cash flows and liquidity; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our financial strategy, budget, projections and operating results; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>oil and natural gas prices that we may realize; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the timing and amount of future production of oil and natural gas; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the availability of drilling and production equipment; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the availability of oil field labor; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the amount, nature and timing of capital expenditures, including future exploration and development costs; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the availability and terms of capital; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our drilling of wells; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>government regulation and taxation of the oil and natural gas industry; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our marketing of oil and natural gas; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our exploitation projects or our ability to make property acquisitions on terms that meet our acquisition criteria; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our costs of exploiting and developing our properties and conducting other operations; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>general economic conditions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 22 \n \n \u25cf competition in the oil and natural gas industry; \u25cf the effectiveness of our risk management and possible future hedging activities; \u25cf environmental liabilities; \u25cf our future operating results; \u25cf estimated future reserves and the present value thereof; and \u25cf our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions contained in this report that are not historical. \nAlthough we believe that the expectations conveyed by the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information available to us on the date such forward-looking statements were made, no assurances can be given as to future results, levels of activity, achievements or financial condition.\nYou should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should recognize that these statements are predictions of future results, which may not occur as anticipated. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements and from historical results, due to the risks and uncertainties described above, as well as others not now anticipated. The impact of any one factor on a particular forward-looking statement is not determinable with certainty as such factors are interdependent upon other factors. The foregoing statements are not exclusive and further information concerning us, including factors that potentially could materially affect our financial results, may emerge from time to time. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements, except as required by law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nUnless otherwise noted, the terms the Company\u201d, Foothills Exploration\u201d, Foothills\u201d, we\u201d, or our\u201d refer to the ongoing business operations of Foothills Exploration, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Foothills Petroleum, Inc., as well as, the past operations of Foothills Petroleum, Inc. The terms Key Link Assets Corp.\u201d or Key Link\u201d refer to the operations of Key Link Assets Corp. prior to May 27, 2016.\nHistory\nFoothills Exploration, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 13, 2010, under the name Key Link Assets Corp.\u201d for the purpose of acquiring a portfolio of heavily discounted real estate properties in the Chicago metropolitan area. The Company changed its focus and planned to acquire small and medium sized grocery stores in non-urban locales that are not directly served by large national supermarket chains.\nOn May 2, 2016, Foothills Petroleum Inc., a Nevada corporation ( FPI\u201d) acquired approximately 14.1 million pre-split (56.4 million post-split) shares of the Company's common stock constituting approximately 96% of our then issued and outstanding shares ( FPI Acquired Shares\u201d). As of May 16, 2016, we effected a 4:1 forward split of our shares of common stock.\nOn May 27, 2016, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with shareholders of FPI whereby we acquired all of the outstanding shares of FPI in exchange for 4,500,000 shares of our common stock and also issued 1,503,759 shares of our common stock on automatic conversion of debt (please see discussion below under Overview) for an aggregate of 6,003,759 shares of our common stock (the Share Exchange\u201d). As a result of the Share Exchange, FPI became our wholly owned subsidiary and the FPI Acquired Shares were returned to treasury and deemed cancelled. For accounting purposes, this transaction is being accounted for as a reverse acquisition and has been treated as a recapitalization of the Company with FPI considered the accounting acquirer, and the financial statements of the accounting acquirer became the financial statements of the registrant. The completion of the Share Exchange resulted in a change of control. The FPI Shareholders obtained approximately 96% of voting control on the date of Share Exchange. FPI was the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Company was the acquired company. The consolidated financial statements after the acquisition include the balance sheets of both companies at historical cost, the historical results of FPI and the results of the Company from the acquisition date. All share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been retroactively restated to reflect the recapitalization.\nPrior to the Share Exchange, we had minimal assets and recognized no revenues from operations, and were accordingly classified as a shell company. On June 24, 2016, we filed an amendment to our Current Report on Form 8-K originally filed on June 10, 2016, indicating that we were no longer a shell company as defined by Rule12b-2 of the Exchange Act. In light of closing of the Share Exchange transaction with FPI, the Company became actively engaged in oil and gas operations through its wholly owned subsidiary.\nOn June 30, 2016, we completed a sale of 3,007,519 shares of our common stock to a single investor for proceeds totaling $2,000,000. For a more complete description of this transaction please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 7, 2016.\nOn August 4, 2016, we were advised that the Financial Industry Regulatory Association had approved (i) our name change from Key Link Assets Corp. to Foothills Exploration, Inc., and (ii) a change of trading symbol from KYLK to FTXP. Please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 9, 2016.\n 23 \n \nOn October 5, 2016, the Company launched its Exploration Division and opened a new office in Houston to support the division's staff. The Company's Exploration Division consists of geologists and petroleum engineers engaged in the exploration and development of hydrocarbons and tasked with building a portfolio of high impact exploration projects in the Gulf Coast region.\nOn December 12, 2016, the Company entered into a participation agreement with Magna Operating, LLC, a privately held Houston-based independent exploration and production company ( Magna Operating\u201d), in relation to the Labokay prospect, covering approximately 240 acres in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. As consideration for an assignment of interest in and to the leases and the prospect, Foothills Petroleum Operating, Inc., a Nevada corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( FPOI\u201d), tendered to Magna Operating the purchase price in the amount of $144,000. This amount covered FPOI's share of the land, lease, and administrative costs that Magna Operating incurred in generating and assembling the Labokay prospect as of November 15, 2016. As further consideration for an assignment of working interest in and to the leases, FPOI agreed to participate in the cost, risk, and expense of drilling the Labokay test well. The well was plugged and abandoned in February 2017. The Company has no immediate plans to engage in further exploration and development activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.\nOn December 30, 2016, the Company acquired various oil and gas assets in Utah from Total Belief Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of New Times Energy Corporation Limited. These assets included certain oil and gas wells throughout the Uinta Basin in Utah on acreage with over 30 proven undeveloped drilling locations, additional non-operating interest in other leases, and access to approximately 6,000 acres in the Uinta Basin with proven and probable reserves and existing infrastructure in place. Through the acquisition, Foothills also obtained six shut-in wells in the Natural Buttes Field, Utah. The transaction provides Foothills with the rights to an agreement to acquire up to 6,000+ acres and up to 16 shut-in oil and gas wells with proved and proved undeveloped reserves on Tribal lands in the Uinta Basin. This acquisition delivers to the Company an additional 40% working interest in the Ladysmith Prospect covering 3,060 acres in the Greater Green River Basin, Wyoming, bringing the Company's total working interest in the prospect from 35% (pre-acquisition) up to 75%.\nBy this agreement, the Company acquired 13,166,667 shares, constituting 55.63% of the outstanding shares of Grey Hawk Exploration, Inc. ( Grey Hawk\u201d), a British Columbia, Canada company. Grey Hawk owns a non-operated working interest in two non-producing wells in the southern portion of the Natural Buttes Field.\nOn December 30, 2016, the Company also acquired the remaining 25% membership interest in Tiger Energy Partners International, LLC ( TEPI\u201d) from Green Stone Capital Partners Limited, a Cayman Islands limited liability company, in exchange for assumption of Greenstone's proportionate share of TEPI obligations and liabilities.\nOn May 10, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement (PSA), with an undisclosed seller, to acquire 67,330 gross acres (49,600 net acres) held by production in Utah and Colorado. This acquisition was anticipated to close by or before June 30, 2017, such closing being subject to traditional representations, warranties, covenants and adjustments including, but not limited to lien releases, cures of any defective title matters, satisfaction of leases and amendments thereto. In August 2017, the parties by mutual agreement terminated the PSA.\nOn October 19, 2017, the Company announced the acquisition of 21% working interest in two horizontal gas wells in the Uinta Basin from an undisclosed party. Both wells are operated by EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EOG). We expect total cost for our 21% working interest in both wells will be $3.2 million. These wells align with the Company's overall growth strategy for the Basin and provides us with the ability to gain insight from a world-class operator. In February 2018, the Company announced the successful drilling, completion and flow testing of the Stagecoach 111-20H and Stagecoach 117-20H horizontal wells, both of which are now producing natural gas in commercial quantities. Both wells have been online since late December 2017 and production tubing is expected to be set in the near term. These two successful horizontal wells will generate production and net cash flow for the Company and are expected to payout within 30 months. As of December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $1,501,377 cost for our shares of interest.\nOverview\nFoothills Exploration is an independent oil and gas exploration company engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties, mainly through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Foothills Petroleum, Inc. ( FPI\u201d). FPI is focused on acquiring producing and developmental properties in the Rockies. FPI seeks to acquire non-core, dislocated and underdeveloped oil and gas assets and maximize those assets to create shareholder value (the Business\u201d).\nOn December 31, 2015, FPI acquired the rights to 38,120 acres of oil and gas property in the state of Wyoming, through Foothills Exploration, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary acquired by FPI upon its organization in December 2015.\nThe Company's principal obligations include:\n \u25cf A debenture in the amount of $1,250,000, plus interest accruing at a rate of 9% per annum issued to Berwin Trading Limited ( Berwin\u201d) with principal and interest due upon maturity on May 6, 2017. On May 5, 2017, the Company and Berwin agreed to extend the maturity date of the debenture to June 20, 2017, in return for an annual interest rate increase from 9% to 13.5% per annum for the life of the debenture. On November 3, 2017, Berwin agreed to defer repayment of this note to a later date, and acknowledged that the Company is not in default regarding this Debenture. Berwin also reaffirmed its belief that the Company will either extend or repay the obligation to their satisfaction. As partial consideration for the deferment, the Company agreed to issue Berwin 100,000 shares of its restricted common stock, valued at $48,000. The issuance of the shares in exchange for the maturity extension was treated as a modification of existing debt pursuant to the guidance of ASC 470-50 Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d ( ASC 470-50\u201d). On February 28, 2018, Berwin and the Company agreed to extend the maturity date of the debenture to June 30, 2018, and as consideration for the extension, the Company agreed to compensate Berwin with 250,000 shares of restricted common stock. In addition, the parties agreed that if payment of said principal and interest due and payable is made late, then a penalty payment of $125,000 shall become due and payable to Berwin by the Company. \u25cf A second debenture in the amount of $1,000,000, plus interest accruing at a rate of 9% issued to Full Wealth Investment Hong Kong Limited ( Full Wealth\u201d) with principal and interest due upon maturity on or before May 5, 2017. On May 18, 2017, Full Wealth sold this note to Gold Class Limited, with accrued interest increased from 9% to 13.5% per annum for the life of the debenture. On June 1, 2017, Full Wealth acquired this note back from Gold Class and the Company issued a new debenture with a 60-day term and 10% interest per annum to Full Wealth. On August 14, 2017, we repaid $1,000,000 in principal and $20,000 in accrued interest and recorded remaining accrued interest in amount of $30,000 as gain on debt forgiveness. \u25cf A promissory note in the amount of $6,000,000 to Total Belief Limited ( TBL\u201d), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of New Times Energy Corporation Limited, issued in connection with the assets acquired on December 30, 2016, with a maturity date of June 30, 2018. This promissory note recites that it accrues no interest during its term and is due and payable in full on or before its maturity date. Foothills recorded $342,804 imputed interest as debt discount. This amount of $342,804 was determined using the present value method based on the following assumptions: (i) adjusted interest rate 4% (ii) expected life of 1.5 years. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we amortized $228,536 debt discount into interest expense. The Company has reduced the value of its oil and gas properties in the proportion of the debt discount allocated to the Note. \u25cf A convertible promissory note in amount of $50,000 was issued to an unrelated party on May 10, 2017, bearing an annual percentage rate of 10% with a term of 12 months, which is due on May 10, 2018. This note may, at the option of the lender, be converted at any time prior to September 7, 2017, into fully-paid, restricted and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company at a price equal to 100% of the selling price of such common stock in a private placement to institutional and/or accredited investors initiated by the Company during the term of this note. On October 19, 2017, the Company agreed to extend the allowable conversion period provided under this convertible note until May 10, 2018. On November 7, 2017, the Company issued 50,000 warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a strike price of $1.00 per share expiring on May 7, 2019. If the Company fails to pay the principal and accrued unpaid interest due and payable to Lender on or before the due date of the convertible note, then the Lender shall be provided the right to convert at either $0.665 per share or upon the same terms offered in FirstFire Opportunity Fund, LLC Note's conversion options. The relative fair value of warrant was determined to be $3,381 on November 7, 2017, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: (i) volatility rate of 77%, (ii) discount rate of 0%, (iii) zero expected dividend yield, and (iv) expected life of 1.5 years. At December 31, 2017, $50,000 of principal was outstanding under the Note. The issuance of the warrants in exchange for the maturity extension was treated as a modification of existing debt pursuant to the guidance of ASC 470-50 Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d ( ASC 470-50\u201d). \u25cf A promissory note to Profit Well Limited, a Hong Kong limited liability company, issued on August 9, 2017, in the amount of $1,050,000. The promissory note bears an annual interest rate of 13.5% and was initially payable on September 8, 2017. The Company received the funds under the foregoing note on August 10, 2017. The funds received pursuant to the Note principally have been used to repay the Full Wealth debenture, dated June 1, 2017. On November 3, 2017, Profit Well Limited agreed to defer repayment of this note to a later date, and acknowledged that the Company is not in default regarding this Debenture. Profit Well Limited also reaffirmed its belief that the Company will either extend or repay the obligation to their satisfaction. As partial consideration for the deferment, the Company agreed to issue Profit Well Limited 100,000 shares of its restricted common stock, valued at $48,000. The issuance of the shares in exchange for the maturity extension was treated as a modification of existing debt pursuant to the guidance of ASC 470-50 Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d ( ASC 470-50\u201d). On February 28, 2018, Profit Well and the Company agreed to extend the maturity date of the debenture to June 30, 2018, and as consideration for the extension, the Company agreed to compensate Profit Well with 200,000 shares of restricted common stock. In addition, the parties agreed that if payment of said principal and interest due and payable is made late, then a penalty payment of $100,000 shall become due and payable to Profit Well by the Company. \u25cf A promissory note and three tranches of warrants issued on September 29, 2017, to an unaffiliated investor for an aggregate consideration of $250,000. This promissory note recites that it accrues no interest if paid when due and is due and payable on January 2, 2018. The obligations under the promissory note were personally guaranteed by Kevin J. Sylla, Executive Chairman of the Company. If principal is not paid on or before January 2, 2018, interest will accrue at the rate of 15% per year until paid. On November 6, 2017, the Company agreed to compensate the investor 75,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock in connection with a more favorable term of a note entered with FirstFire Opportunity Fund, LLC. On December 30, 2017, the Company and the investor agreed to extend the maturity date of this Note to January 23, 2018, in return for a payment at maturity of the principal, accrued interest as provided in the Note, plus 30,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock. Because the fair value of the shares was greater than 10% of the present value of the remaining cash flows under the Note, the issuance of the shares in connection with a more favorable term of a note entered with FirstFire Opportunity Fund, LLC. was treated as a debt extinguishment and reissuance of a new debt instrument pursuant to the guidance of ASC 470-50 Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments\u201d ( ASC 470-50\u201d). Since January 23, 2018, the Company and the investor have been in ongoing discussions to extend the term of this Note. On March 28, 2018, the investor acknowledged that the Company is not in default regarding this Note and reaffirmed its belief that the Company will either extend the Note's due date or repay its obligation on terms that are mutually satisfactory. \n 24 \n \nThe warrants have the following terms:\n \u25cf 375,000 warrants to purchase 375,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a strike price of $0.665 per share expiring on September 29, 2019, \u25cf 375,000 warrants to purchase 375,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a strike price of $1.25 per share expiring on September 29, 2020, \u25cf 185,000 warrants to purchase 185,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a strike price of $2.00 per share expiring on September 29, 2020. \nThe aggregate relative fair value of three tranches of warrants was determined to be $105,000 on September 29, 2017, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: (i) volatility rate of 94%, (ii) discount rate of 0%, (iii) zero expected dividend yield, and (iv) expected life of 2-3 years. $2,536 imputed interest was recorded as debt discount. $2,536 was determined using the present value method based on the following assumptions: (i) adjusted interest rate 4% (ii) expected life of 0.26 year. The aggregate value of the warrants and imputed interest of $107,536 was considered as debt discount upon issuance and will be amortized as interest over the term of the Note or in full upon the conversion of the Note. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company amortized $105,272 of such discount to interest expense, and the unamortized discount as of December 31, 2017 was $2,264. At December 31, 2017, $250,000 of principal was outstanding under the Note.\nEach tranche of warrants is subject to down round adjustment provisions if the Company during the term of that tranche issues additional securities for consideration per share, after giving effect to fees, commission and expenses, that is less, or which on conversion or exercise of the underlying security is less, than $0.665 per share (as adjusted for any change resulting from forward or reverse splits, stock dividends and similar events).\nTo satisfy most favored nation provisions in previously entered securities purchase agreements that are triggered by the transaction described above, Company issued 136,015 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 136,015 shares of common stock, in the aggregate, to certain investors who purchased units from the Company, at a $1.00 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share and one warrant. See the Company's Current Report on the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 5, 2017. Of this amount, 100,752 shares and warrants to purchase 100,752 shares of common stock will be issued to Wilshire Energy Partners LLC, an entity controlled by Kevin J. Sylla. The exercise price of these investor warrants was adjusted to $0.665 per share. We measured the value of the effect of the down round feature as the difference between the fair value of the financial instrument at an original exercise price of $1.50 and an adjusted exercise price of $0.665 and, as a result, $59,801 was recorded as down round feature as interest expense under ASC 260-10-30-1. Foothills determined the amount of $59,801 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: (i) volatility rate of 94%, (ii) discount rate of 0%, (iii) zero expected dividend yield, and (iv) expected life of 3 years.\n \u25cf A convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $267,500, with net proceeds of $250,000 before giving effect to certain transactional costs including legal fees, was issued to FirstFire Opportunity Fund, LLC, on November 17, 2017. As part of this transaction the Company also issued: \nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>warrants having an 18-month term, to purchase 267,500 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>60,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock. </td> </tr>\n</table>\n The convertible note accrues interest of 8% per annum and is due and payable on August 17, 2018. The warrants are subject to adjustment in certain events such as forward or reverse stock splits or if subsequent financings are at terms that are more favorable to persons in subsequent issuances of securities. The convertible note agreements give the lender the right to convert the loan amounts due into common stock at a conversion price of $0.665 per share, subject to adjustment under certain events, and the Company has the option but not the obligation to repay the outstanding principal of the convertible note, in whole or in part, within six months from the closing date, by paying 115% of the principal amount then owing, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to avoid conversion under the convertible agreements. The convertible note may not be prepaid from 180 days after closing until maturity and is secured by a personal guaranty from the Company's Executive Chairman, Kevin Sylla. The net proceeds of the convertible note will be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. No broker-dealer or placement agent was retained or involved in this transaction. See 8-K report filed with the SEC on November 17, 2017 for more information. \u25cf A promissory note was issued on November 1, 2017, to the Law Offices of Aaron A. Grunfeld or its successors or assigns (the Holder\u201d), the Company's outside general counsel, for a principal amount of $120,628.95 in exchange of legal services rendered, bearing an interest rate of 12% per annum and with a maturity date of June 30, 2018. \nFrom its inception in December 2015 through December 31, 2017, Foothills generated $101,998 in revenue from its principal business operations and is currently still an exploration stage company. Prior to January 2016, Foothills' operations were focused mainly on administrative activities connected to the identification and evaluation of potential oil and gas prospects and other potential leasehold acquisitions in our geographical areas of interest.\n 25 \n \nOn December 30, 2016, the Company acquired various oil and gas assets in Utah from a subsidiary of New Times Energy Corporation Limited ( New Times\u201d). These assets included certain oil and gas wells throughout the Uinta Basin in Utah, on acreage with over 30 proven undeveloped drilling locations, additional non-operating interest in other leases, and access to approximately 6,000 acres in the Uinta Basin with proven and probable reserves and existing infrastructure in place. This purchase provides the Company with an entry point into the Uinta Basin and a basis from which to seek other bolt-on acquisition opportunities in the Rockies. The transaction delivers to the Company a licensed and bonded operator in Utah having bonds in place with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), State of Utah and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).\nThrough this acquisition from New Times, the Company also obtained six shut-in wells in the Natural Buttes Field, Utah. After the acquisition, these wells were worked over and brought back online with production averaging around 183 barrels per month in Q2 2017. The Company plans to work over the remaining three wells in the coming months.\nThe transaction provided the Company with the rights to an agreement to acquire up to 6,000+ acres and up to 16 shut-in oil and gas wells with proved and proved undeveloped reserves on Ute Tribal lands in the Uinta Basin. These properties provide in-field drilling potential, the ability to bring online shut-in wells and behind pipe development. Five shut-in wells located on fee lands in the Altamont-Bluebell Field that are undergoing title curative have the potential to achieve near term production with stimulation and the addition of surface equipment.\nFurthermore, this acquisition delivered to the Company an additional 40% working interest in the Ladysmith Prospect, covering 3,060 acres in the Greater Green River Basin, Wyoming, increasing the Company's pre-acquisition working interest of 35% up to a total of 75%.\nLastly, through this acquisition, the Company also acquired 13,166,667 shares of common stock, constituting 55.63% of the outstanding shares of Grey Hawk Exploration, Inc. ( Grey Hawk\u201d), a British Columbia, Canada company. Grey Hawk owns a non-operated working interest in two wells in the southern portion of the Greater Natural Buttes Field in Utah. These two wells are not currently producing.\nTo acquire these assets, the Company paid a total consideration of $10.75 million in a combination of cash, stock and promissory note consisting of:\n \u25cf $750,000 cash; \u25cf 2,083,334 shares of the Company's restricted common stock valued by the parties at $4,000,000 at an agreed upon price per share of $1.92; and a \u25cf Promissory note in the principal amount of $6,000,000 due and payable in full 18 months from December 30, 2016 and accruing no interest during its term. \nFor financial accounting purposes the 2,083,334 shares were valued at the closing market price on the day of the transaction, which was $1.83, accordingly the shares were presented at a value of $3,812,501 on the Company's financial statements on December 30, 2016.\nOur financial statements reflect that our current liabilities exceed our current assets and it is possible that the historical value of the assets that we record on our books may not be attained on a sale or other disposition for cash. We require substantial additional operating capital to maintain current operations and to implement even a portion of our identified acquisitions and workovers. Additional capital, if available at all, will likely be on onerous terms that are also dilutive to our shareholders. No assurance can be given that we will obtain any additional capital. As a consequence, an investment in our shares or other securities is extremely speculative and may result in a complete loss of your investment.\nMarket Environment\nThe U.S. energy markets continued to see improved fundamentals for both crude oil and natural gas markets during 3Q17, as prices remained in a tight range for both products and volatility at the low end of the range relative to historic averages. Looking ahead at the remainder of the year and into 2018, we believe the U.S. energy markets are poised for a major price move for both crude oil and natural gas prices as well as a significant uptick in price volatility. Our bias remains moderately bullish for both WTI and natural gas prices going forward and we are looking for a breakout above the current trading ranges that has dominated year-to-date.\nOil - As disclosed in our previous Form 10-Q Quarterly Report for period ended June 30, 2017, OPEC and Non-OPEC producing nations' production cuts announced earlier in the year have reportedly begun to reduce global oil supplies. We are now seeing that in the global pricing structure as Brent crude oil price is now trading at roughly a $6 premium to the WTI crude oil price. We believe that the catalyst for the widening spread is twofold: 1) U.S. shale production continued to grow reportedly reaching 9.2 million barrels per day, its highest level since November 2015 and 2) global oil supplies reportedly are falling, highlighted by a 14.2 million barrel drop in August 2017. We believe that when Brent trades at a $4 premium or greater to WTI, U.S. oil becomes a more attractive export, resulting in greater U.S. oil exports in 2017. We expect that this trend likely may continue in 2018. In short, robust U.S. oil exports coupled with strong U.S. demand for refined products, should accelerate in our view the decline rate for U.S. oil supplies and be supportive of oil prices moving forward.\n 26 \n \nGlobal demand for crude oil continues to grow at a steady pace. The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its most recent monthly oil market report for October 2017 forecasted global demand for crude oil growing by 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and by 1.4 million bpd in 2018. The IEA also estimates that global oil demand will reach 100.0 million barrels per day in Q4 2018, which would set a record that in our view will become a key psychological level for the oil markets. In the U.S., the IEA forecasts gasoline demand will average 9.3 million barrels per day in 2017, and 9.4 million barrels per day in 2018, an annual increase of 1%. Reported global demand for oil and refined products are at or near record levels, which is alleviating the supply overhang and in our view supporting a bullish outlook heading into the end of the year and into 2018.\nNatural Gas - After being in a bear market for nearly a decade, we believe that commodity fundamentals have significantly improved over the course of 2017 to date. With LNG exports and exports to Mexico reportedly at record levels, the U.S. appears slated to become a net exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1957. We expect U.S. dry gas production to be roughly 71 BCF per day in 2017, while demand and export growth should average about 76 BCF per day. Given this, the natural gas storage glut has been significantly reduced with current storage levels now at the trailing 5-year average as we head into the heating/withdrawal season. A stronger-than-expected heating season driven by colder than average temperatures in key heating regions could send natural gas prices above $4.00 MMBtu.\nOur Strategy\nFoothills' strategic objective is to build a portfolio of producing properties that have relatively low operating costs, long lived reserves and upside development potential. The Company's goal is to build a land bank of over 200,000 acres of proven, probable and prospective reserves during this period of relatively low commodity pricing. Foothills intends to accomplish this by acquiring oil and gas properties with attractive valuation metrics and attractive geological risk/reward profiles that are well positioned to benefit from an improvement in commodity prices. No assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve this objective.\nThe Company's primary focus is the Rocky Mountain region, where its consultants and technical staff have conducted oil and gas operations and collectively have in our view developed significantly material operating experience. Management believes that the Company's tight geographical focus and regional experience, coupled with our strategic industry relationships may advantageously position Foothills to acquire high quality oil and gas assets at attractive valuations in the current environment.\nThe Company's acquisitions and roll up strategy is based on identifying undercapitalized, yet attractive oil and gas assets selling at what we anticipate to be a discount to intrinsic value. Foothills focuses on acquiring oil and gas assets that have existing production, with existing infrastructure in place and future developmental potential. Once we acquire oil and gas assets, management expects to target adjacent oil and gas properties with similar characteristics for bolt on acquisitions to increase our geographical acreage position. By consolidating and exploiting additional acreage as part of its rollup strategy, management intends to achieve operating efficiencies to maximize shareholder value.\nWyoming Properties\nThe principal Wyoming assets owned by the Company currently consist of non-producing, yet prospective mineral leases in the Ladysmith project.\nLadysmith Project\nFoothills owns a 75% working interest in the Ladysmith Anticline prospect that is located in Fremont County, Wyoming. Total acreage position is 3,061 acres located between the Great Divide/Greater Green River Basin and the Wind River Basin. The primary target zones are the variable Phosphoria and Tensleep sandstone with secondary considerations in the Madison limestone and Flathead sandstone. The prospect generation was based on licensed 2-D seismic comprising of two seismic lines covering the Chevron/Echo - Greater Green River Basin. Foothills' has conducted two BLM onsite inspections to date and work continues on a surface access use agreement, completion of drilling unit outline and a schedule for BLM area and depth meeting in the near term. Spring conditions will soon enable Foothills to gain access to prospect area and commence Right of Way (ROW) application, surveying and archeology study. Additional BLM acreage acquisition and federal unit formation are continued processes, with detailed development plans for surface use being formulated.\nSprings Project\nDuring Q4 2017, the Company allowed the BLM leases for the Springs project to expire without paying additional delay rental payments. The primary terms on these leases were due to expire in Q4 2018 and management did not feel it was in the best interest of the Company stakeholders to continue its exploratory efforts on a speculative, wildcat play. As such, Management made a business decision to reduce the Company's portfolio of exploration plays and instead continue seeking lower-risk acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties rather than take additional wildcat drilling risk on this prospect. As such, the Company no longer owns the mineral rights for this project. As the result, the Company recognized impairment of oil and gas property in amount of $150,593, during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n 27 \n \nPaw Paw Project\nThe Paw Paw project is a 3-D seismic defined prospect, which covers 4,467 acres and is a direct analog to the highly productive Tensleep Formation Enigma\u201d Field (EUR 3.7 million barrels of oil) located only two miles to the south. The Tensleep Formation has a history of prolific area production with two nearby analogues. The Paw Paw project has potential from primary and secondary recovery of up to 2 million barrels of oil. On December 11, 2016, the Company completed drilling operations on the Paw Paw Federal #1 test well. The Big Horn County Wyoming test well reached total depth in the Madison Formation and the Company successfully logged and acquired valid data to further evaluate the project's potential. The Company's technical team and consulting geological firm, Geopinion\u00ae Inc., is continuing to evaluate test well results and further interpret and analyze 3D seismic data in order to identify favorable potential future locations for possible commercial wells. The test well has been temporarily abandoned while the parties continue to analyze results during the evaluation stage.\nThe Paw Paw Federal #1 test well reached total depth in the Madison Formation after drilling an anticipated stratigraphic section and thrust fault. Oil shows were found in the Muddy, Phosphoria, and Madison formations. The Phosphoria is a regionally productive formation and could end up being the secondary zone in sidetrack operations should that type of operation be deemed commercially economic. Upon evaluation of the test well's seismic structural position and analysis of modern well log data, the technical team has determined that a successful sidetrack operation is likely to yield commercial oil reserves from the Tensleep and any other sands with oil shows and concurred that the test well, which is temporarily abandoned, should be considered for re-entry. The Company intends to sidetrack this well with the objective of eventually completing this well to produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons from the target formation. We encountered a fault while drilling the well, which required additional geological and engineering work. The Company has since mapped out the issue and intends to continue drilling operations. The Company has deferred recommencing drilling operations because certain lease title issues were encountered during the period of geological discovery, which the Company is currently working to mend. The Company intends to recommence continuous operations with the objective of sidetracking this well to produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons from the target formation during Q3 2018, once certain wildlife stipulations affecting oil and gas operations on the BLM lands surrounding this well come to an end. No assurance can be given that these precise efforts by our experienced technical team and our further development efforts of the prospect, including further drilling activity, will yield a commercially successful well.\nIronwood Project\nThe Company had intended to drill a test well on the Ironwood prospect during the first half of 2017 but was unable to do so within the agreement term and as such, the Company failed to earn into this prospect to hold the acreage from current production and no longer has any rights to this project. During the second half of 2017 Management decided to focus its full attention on acquiring and developing properties with existing reserves and infield development opportunities rather than take additional wildcat drilling risk on any prospect.\nUtah Properties\nTiger Energy Operating, LLC\nTiger Energy Operating, LLC, ( TEO\u201d) is a licensed and bonded oil and gas operator in the state of Utah. TEO is the operator of record for a total of six oil and gas wells situated on 280 acres in the Duck Creek area of the Altamont Bluebell field. In late 2015 and early 2016 these wells were shut-in due to financial issues with the previous owner. During the calendar year 2017, the Company sold a total of approximately 2,137 barrels of oil, which were produced from three of its Duck Creek wells. The Company has developed a Duck Creek optimization program and needs to raise approximately $900,000 to complete workover operations on these wells, which are expected to increase total production to approximately 210 barrels of oil per day. Management anticipates obtaining the necessary capital enabling the Company to implement this workover program during the current fiscal year. TEO has cash and surety bonds in place with the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Utah Department of Natural Resources Division of Oil, Gas and Mining that are valued at about $295,000.\nTiger Energy Partners International, LLC\nTiger Energy Partners International, LLC, ( TEPI\u201d) owns all rights and interests pertaining to the Global Settlement Agreement ( GSA\u201d) for the Uintah and Ouray Reservation between Mountain Oil & Gas, Inc. and the MOG Entities (Craig Phillips) and the Ute Indian Tribe (the Tribe\u201d) of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, dated December 22, 2014. TEPI also owns all rights and interests acquired in the Purchase and Sale Agreements between TEPI and Mountain Oil & Gas, Inc. dated April 16, 2012, and December 18, 2012. TEPI expects to move forward with this transaction in 2018 via a revised Global Settlement Agreement with the parties to said agreement. The Company is bound by confidentiality provisions in the GSA and as such is prohibited from disclosing any additional details.\n 28 \n \nTiger Energy Mineral Leasing, LLC\nTiger Energy Mineral Leasing, LLC ( TEML\u201d) owns certain non-operating working interests, which were previously operated by Rig II, LLC. In 2017, Rig II, LLC, sold its operating rights in said leases to Crescent Point Energy Corp. (NYSE: CPG), who is the current operator of record for these leases. The Company realized approximately $4,532 in total net revenues during 2017 from this non-operated working interest. In addition, TEML also owns a 40% working interest, in the Ladysmith prospect, which increases the Company's total working interest in this prospect to 75%. TEML also owns all rights and interests pertaining to the Rio Capital Acquisition dated September 25, 2014, pertaining to oil and gas leases in the Altamont-Bluebell field located in Duchesne and Uintah Counties, Utah.\nGulf Coast Properties\nOn December 15, 2016, the Company announced a Participation Agreement with Magna Operating, LLC, in relation to the Labokay prospect, covering 240 acres in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana.\nLabokay Prospect\nLabokay is an amplitude versus offset\u201d ( AVO\u201d) oil play in Southwestern Louisiana targeting the Frio Nododaria Blanpiedi Sand. On February 14, 2017, the Company announced that it had reached total depth in its Labokay Prospect well located in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. The well was drilled to a total measured depth of 8,795 feet where hydrocarbon shows were present, but not in commercial quantities to warrant completion. The well has been plugged and abandoned as required. The Company estimates well costs incurred or to be incurred for the Labokay at approximately $1.3 million, including plugging and abandonment liability.\nThe Company has no immediate plans to engage in further exploration and development activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.\nPlan of Operations\nCurrent energy prices have exposed attractive U.S. based assets that are poorly capitalized and neglected, which are now selling at discounted prices, providing multiple entry points to acquire attractive oil and gas assets. Foothills intends to acquire dislocated and non-core oil and gas assets from larger exploration and production companies.\nFoothills is focused on acquiring and rolling up smaller operators in a considerably fragmented oil and gas market and through consolidation, management believes Foothills can effectively scale its production and acreage position and collectively unlock value in the acquired oil and gas assets to create shareholder value. No assurance can be given that the Company will acquire adequate cash or other resources to be able to attain any of these objectives.\nAcquiring additional assets and companies in the Rockies\nThe Company is targeting acquisitions in a tightly defined geographical area of interest, which meet certain metrics and future development potential. The Company anticipates that these acquisitions will be funded through the sale of common stock, debt and cash generated from the Company's financing activities, including public, private and possible institutional offerings in capital market transactions and future reserve based lending activities. Subject to the securing of additional capital, the Company anticipates making additional bolt-on acquisitions of producing properties, which can potentially be leveraged and optimized by applying its technical capabilities and improving operational efficiencies. Although the Company is currently evaluating several prospective acquisitions, which meet its criteria, no assurance can be given that it will be successful in any of these endeavors.\nRetain Operational Control and Significant Working Interest\nIn its principal acquisition and development targets, the Company aims to preserve operational control of its development and drilling activities. As the operator for its projects, the Company retains more control over the timing, selection and process of drilling prospects and completion design, which enhances its ability to maximize the return on invested capital and gives greater control over the timing, allocation and amounts of capital expenditures.\nLeasing of Prospective Acreage\nIn the course of our day-to-day business, the Company regularly identifies drilling and development opportunities on additional acreage in its areas of interest that have not yet been leased. Subject to securing additional capital, the Company may take the initiative to lease prospective acreage in our areas of interest and may sell all or any portion of our leased acreage to other companies seeking to participate in the drilling and development of the prospect acreage.\n 29 \n \nGovernment Regulations\nGovernmental Regulation and Environmental Consideration\nThe oil and gas business in the United States is subject to regulation by both federal and state authorities, particularly with respect to pricing, allowable rates of production, marketing and environmental matters. The production of crude oil and gas has, in recent years, been the subject of increasing state and federal controls. No assurance can be given that newly imposed or changed federal laws will not adversely affect the economic viability of any oil and gas properties we currently own and/or may acquire in the future. Federal income and windfall profit\u201d taxes have in the past affected the economic viability of such properties. The following discussion provides a brief overview of potential state and federal regulations. Because Foothills to date has acquired specific properties, and because of the wider range of activities in which the Company expects to participate, management believes that it is not practical currently to set forth in detail the potential impact federal and state regulations may have on our operations.\nThe Department of Energy\nThe Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. No. 95-91) became effective October 1, 1977. Under this Act various agencies, including the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) and the Federal Power Commission (FPC), have been consolidated to constitute the cabinet-level Department of Energy (DOE). The Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA), a semi-independent administration within the DOE, now administers most of the regulatory programs formerly managed by the FEA, including oil pricing and allocation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), an independent agency within the DOE, has assumed the FPC's responsibility for natural gas regulation.\nCrude Oil and Natural Gas Liquids Price and Allocation Regulation\nPursuant to Executive Order Number 12287, issued January 28, 1981, President Reagan lifted all existing federal price and allocation controls over the sale and distribution of crude oil and natural gas liquids. Executive Order Number 12287 was made effective as of January 28, 1981, and consequently, sales of crude oil and natural gas liquids after January 27, 1981 are free from federal regulation. The price for such sales and the supplier-purchaser relationship will be determined by private contract and prevailing market conditions. Because of this action, oil that may be sold by us will be sold at deregulated or free market prices. At various times, certain groups have advocated the reestablishment of regulations and control on the sale of domestic oil and gas.\nState Regulations\nFoothills' production of oil and gas, if any, will be subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we may produce oil and gas. In general, these regulatory authorities are empowered to make and enforce regulations to prevent waste of oil and gas and to protect correlative rights and opportunities to produce oil and gas as between owners of a common reservoir. Some regulatory authorities may also regulate the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production.\nEnvironmental Laws\nOil and gas exploration and development are specifically subject to existing federal and state laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing, or producing oil and gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation.\nAll of our operations involving the exploration for or the production of any minerals are subject to existing laws and regulations relating to exploration procedures, safety precautions, employee health and safety, air quality standards, pollution of streams and fresh water sources, odor, noise, dust, and other environmental protection controls adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as the right of adjoining property owners. We may be required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of minerals may have upon the environment. All requirements imposed by any such authorities may be costly, time consuming, and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations.\nIt may be anticipated that future legislation will significantly emphasize the protection of the environment, and that, as a consequence, our activities may be more closely regulated to further the cause of environmental protection. Such legislation, as well as future interpretation of existing laws, may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs to us and delays, interruptions, or a termination of operations, the extent to which cannot now be predicted.\n 30 \n \nTitle to Properties\nFoothills owns the interest in its properties and also at times relies on contracts with the owner or operator of the property, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company has the right to have its interest placed of record. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we anticipate that a preliminary title examination will be conducted at the time unproved properties or interests are acquired by us. Prior to commencement of drilling operations on such acreage and prior to the acquisition of proved properties, Foothills will conduct a title examination and attempt to cure materially significant defects before proceeding with operations or the acquisition of proved properties, as it may deem appropriate. Foothills properties are subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other interests customary in the industry, liens incident to agreements, current taxes and other burdens, minor encumbrances, easements and restrictions. Foothills' Utah properties acquired from Total Belief Limited on December 30, 2016, are subject to a certain Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA\u201d) Administrative Appeal and a Ute Indian Tribe Global Settlement Agreement, each of which does or may affect title to some, all or none of the properties acquired. Foothills is currently attempting to cure title on these properties, subject to the outcome of the BIA Administrative Appeal, which is still ongoing as of November 14, 2017. To the extent that such defects or disputes exist and cannot be cured, Foothills would suffer title failures, which could result in property valuation impairments and other material adverse consequences to the operations of the Company.\nCorporate Headquarters\nWe are headquartered in Denver, Colorado, where we have 4,295 square feet of corporate office space. Effective May 1, 2017, we signed a 39-month lease for our Denver corporate office. Total rent is approximately $10,051 per month and the Company deems it to be adequate for our current operations.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nWe had revenue of $101,998 for the year ended December 31, 2017, and no revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. We can provide no assurance that we will continue drilling and revenue producing operations or that such drilling and revenue operations, if continued, will be successful.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our management and personnel, and professional fees, such as accounting, consulting and legal.
