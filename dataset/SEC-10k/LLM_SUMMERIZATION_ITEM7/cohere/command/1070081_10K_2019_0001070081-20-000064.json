Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nWe are a science-driven global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically-differentiated medicines that provide benefits to patients with rare disorders. Our ability to commercialize products is the foundation that drives our continued investment in a robust diversified pipeline of transformative medicines and our mission to provide access to best-in-class treatments for patients who have an unmet medical need. Our strategy is to bring best-in-class therapies with differentiated clinical benefit to patients affected by rare disorders and to leverage our global commercial infrastructure to maximize value for our patients and other stakeholders. We have a portfolio pipeline that includes commercial products as well as product candidates in various stages of development, including clinical, pre-clinical and research and discovery stages, focused on the development of new treatments for multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases and oncology.\nWe have two products, Translarna\u2122 (ataluren) and Emflaza\u2122 (deflazacort), for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, a rare, life threatening disorder. Translarna has marketing authorization in the European Economic Area, or EEA, for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or nmDMD, in ambulatory patients aged two years and older and in Brazil for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $190.0 million in sales of Translarna. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to Translarna for all indications in all territories. Emflaza is approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD in patients two years and older. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Emflaza achieved net sales of $101.0 million.\nOur marketing authorization for Translarna in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment. In July 2019, the European Commission renewed our marketing authorization, making it effective, unless extended, through August 5, 2020. In February 2020, we submitted a marketing authorization renewal request to the EMA. This marketing authorization is further subject to a specific obligation to conduct and submit the results of a18-month, placebo-controlled trial, followed by an 18-month open-label extension, which we refer to together as Study 041. The final report on the trial and open-label extension is to be submitted by us to the EMA by the end of the third quarter of 2022.\nEach country, including each member state of the EEA, has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations. In order to commence commercial sale of product pursuant to our Translarna marketing authorization in any particular country in the EEA, we must finalize pricing and reimbursement negotiations with the applicable government body in such country. As a result, our commercial launch will continue to be on a country-by-country basis. We also have made, and expect to continue to make, product available under early access programs, or EAP programs, both in countries in the EEA and other territories. Our ability to negotiate, secure and maintain reimbursement for product under commercial and EAP programs can be subject to challenge in any particular country and can also be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments in such country.\nThere is substantial risk that if we are unable to renew our EEA marketing authorization during any annual renewal cycle, or if our product label is materially restricted, or if Study 041 does not provide the data necessary to maintain our marketing authorization, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna in the EEA and other territories.\nTranslarna is an investigational new drug in the United States. During the first quarter of 2017, we filed a New Drug Application, or NDA, for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD over protest with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In October 2017, the Office of Drug Evaluation I of the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the NDA, stating that it was unable to approve the application in its current form. In response, we filed a formal dispute resolution request with the Office of New Drugs of the FDA. In February 2018, the Office of New Drugs of the FDA denied our appeal of the Complete Response Letter. In its response, the Office of New Drugs recommended a possible path forward for the ataluren NDA submission based on the accelerated approval pathway. This would involve a re-submission of an NDA containing the current data on effectiveness of ataluren with new data to be generated on dystrophin production in nmDMD patients' muscles. We intend to follow the FDA's recommendation and will collect, using newer technologies via procedures and methods that we designed, such dystrophin data in a new study, Study 045, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect that a potential re-submission of an NDA could occur in mid-year 2020. Additionally, should a re-submission of an NDA receive accelerated approval, the Office of New Drugs stated that Study 041, which is currently enrolling, could serve as the confirmatory post-approval trial required in connection with the accelerated approval framework.\nThere is substantial risk that Study 045, or any other studies we may use to collect the dystrophin data, will not provide the necessary data to support a marketing approval for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the U.S.\nWe hold the rights for the commercialization of Tegsedi\u2122 (inotersen) and Waylivra\u2122 (volanesorsen) for the treatment of rare diseases in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean pursuant to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Akcea Therapeutics, Inc., or Akcea. Tegsedi has received marketing authorization in the United States, EU and Brazil for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis. Waylivra has received marketing authorization in the European Union, or EU, for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS. We anticipate filing for marketing authorization with ANVISA in the second half of 2020.\nWe have a pipeline of gene therapy product candidates for rare monogenic diseases that affect the central nervous system, or CNS, including PTC-AADC for the treatment of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase, or AADC, deficiency, or AADC deficiency, a rare CNS disorder arising from reductions in the enzyme AADC that result from mutations in the dopa decarboxylase gene. We are preparing a biologics license application, or BLA, for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States, which we anticipate submitting to the FDA in the second quarter of 2020. In January 2020, we submitted a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the EEA to the EMA and we expect an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, by the end of 2020.\nWe also have a spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, collaboration with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffman-La Roche Inc., which we refer to collectively as Roche, and the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation, or SMA Foundation. The lead compound in the SMA program is risdiplam (RG7916, RO7034067). Roche submitted an NDA for risdiplam to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date for a decision by the FDA is May 24, 2020. Risdiplam is expected to be indicated in the United States for SMA type 1, 2 and 3 patients, if approved. Roche anticipates submitting an MAA for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA in the EEA in mid-year 2020.\nIn 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of BioElectron Technology Corporation, or BioElectron, including certain compounds that we have begun to develop as part of our Bio-e platform. In 2020, we plan to initiate three trials in this platform with two unique compounds that regulate inflammation and oxidative stress.\nIn addition, we have a pipeline of product candidates and discovery programs that are in early clinical, pre-clinical and research and development stages focused on the development of new treatments for multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases and oncology.\nOverview-Funding\nThe success of our products and any other product candidates we may develop, depends largely on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement from governments and third-party insurers. During 2019, our revenues were generated from sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in countries where we were able to obtain acceptable commercial pricing and reimbursement terms and in select countries where we are permitted to distribute Translarna under our EAP programs, and from sales of Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States.\nSee Item 1. Business-Commercial Matters-Market Access Considerations\u201d for additional information and Item 1A. Risk Factors-Commercialization of Translarna has been in, and is expected to continue to take place in, countries that tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues. Failure to obtain and maintain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and other countries where Translarna is available would delay or prevent us from marketing our product in such regions, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\u201d\nOn April 20, 2017, we completed our acquisition of all rights to Emflaza, or the Transaction, for total upfront consideration comprised of $75.0 million in cash, funded through cash on hand, and 6,683,598 shares of our common stock, which was determined by dividing $65.0 million by the volume weighted average price per share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq for the 15 trading-day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the closing.\nOn May 5, 2017, we entered into a credit and security agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with MidCap Financial Trust, or MidCap Financial, as administrative agent and MidCap Financial and other certain institutions as lenders thereto, that provides for a senior secured term loan facility of $60 million, of which $40 million was drawn by us on May 5, 2017. Our ability to draw on the remaining $20.0 million under the senior secured term loan facility expired on December 31, 2018. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is May 1, 2021, unless terminated earlier.\nIn April 2018, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. We issued and sold an aggregate of 4,600,000 shares of common stock under the registration statement at a public offering price of $27.04 per share, including 600,000 shares issued upon exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase\nadditional shares. We received net proceeds of approximately $117.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nOn August 23, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Agilis Biotherapeutics, Inc., or Agilis, for total upfront consideration comprised of $49.2 million in cash and 3,500,907 shares of our common stock, which was determined by dividing $150.0 million by the volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock on Nasdaq for the 10 consecutive trading-day period ending on the second trading-day immediately preceding the closing.\nIn January 2019, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. We issued and sold an aggregate of 7,563,725 shares of common stock under the registration statement at a public offering price of $30.20 per share, including 843,725 shares issued upon exercise by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional shares in February 2019. We received net proceeds of approximately $224.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn August 2019, we entered into an At the Market Offering Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, or together, the Sales Agents, pursuant to which, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $125.0 million from time to time through the Sales Agents by any method that is deemed to be an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued and sold an aggregate of 63,926 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement at a weighted average public offering price of $46.60 per share. We received net proceeds of $2.6 million after deducting agent discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn September 2019, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. We issued and sold an aggregate of 2,475,248 shares of common stock under the registration statement at a public offering price of $40.40 per share. The offering included an option to purchase up to an additional 371,287 shares for a period of 30 days following the offering. This option was not exercised by the underwriter. We received net proceeds of $97.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn September 2019, we issued $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due September 15, 2026, or the 2026 Convertible Notes, which included an option to purchase up to an additional $37.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes, which was exercised in full by the initial purchasers. The 2026 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 1.50% per year, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. The 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on September 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. We received net proceeds of $279.3 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.\nOn October 25, 2019, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of BioElectron for total upfront consideration of $10.0 million in cash less (i) transaction expenses incurred by BioElectron, (ii) the amount of outstanding indebtedness of BioElectron including a $4.0 million loan advance to BioElectron plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (iii) $1.5 million held in an escrow account to secure potential indemnification obligations owed to us.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through our offering of 3.00% convertible senior notes due August 15, 2022, or the 2022 Convertible Notes offering, our offering of 1.50% convertible senior notes due September 15, 2026, or the 2026 Convertible Notes, and, together with the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes, our public offerings of common stock in February 2014, in October 2014, in April 2018, in January 2019, and in September 2019, the common stock issued in our at the marketing offering\u201d, our initial public offering of common stock in June 2013, private placements of our preferred stock, collaborations, bank debt and convertible debt financings, the Credit Agreement and grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates. Since 2014, we have also relied on revenue generated from net sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States, and since May 2017, we have generated revenue from net sales of Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,190.5 million. We had a net loss of $251.6 million and $128.1 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe anticipate that our expenses will continue to increase in connection with our commercialization efforts in the United States, the EEA, Latin America and other territories, including the expansion of our infrastructure and corresponding sales and marketing, legal and regulatory, distribution and manufacturing, including expanding our direct manufacturing capabilities at our new biologics manufacturing facility and administrative and employee-based expenses. In addition to the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur ongoing research and development expenses for our products and product candidates, including our gene therapy, splicing, Bio-e and oncology programs as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, including Study\n041, label extensions and additional indications. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in connection with our efforts to advance our regulatory submissions. We continue to seek marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories that we do not currently have marketing authorization in and we may also seek marketing authorization for Translarna for other indications. We submitted an MAA to the EMA for the treatment of AADC deficiency with PTC-AADC in the EEA and we are preparing a BLA for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States, which we anticipate submitting to the FDA in the second quarter of 2020. We also anticipate filing for marketing authorization for Waylivra with ANVISA in the second half of 2020. These efforts may significantly impact the timing and extent of our commercialization expenses.\nWe may seek to expand and diversify our product pipeline through opportunistically in-licensing or acquiring the rights to products, product candidates or technologies and we may incur expenses, including with respect to transaction costs, subsequent development costs or any upfront, milestone or other payments or other financial obligations associated with any such transaction, which would increase our future capital requirements.\nWith respect to our outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes, cash interest payments are payable on a semi-annual basis in arrears, which require total funding of $4.5 million annually. With respect to our outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes, cash interest payments are payable on a semi-annual basis in arrears, which will require total funding of $4.3 million annually. Additionally, under the terms of our Credit Agreement cash interest payments are payable monthly in arrears. We are also required to pay $40.0 million in development milestone payments upon the passing of the second anniversary of the closing of the Agilis acquisition, August 23, 2020, regardless of whether the applicable milestones have been achieved. In addition, Akcea is eligible to receive from us an additional milestone payment of $4.0 million upon receipt of regulatory approval for Waylivra from ANVISA. Furthermore, since we are a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as such including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. See also, The price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock and lawsuits against us and our officers and directors\u201d under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Common Stock.\nWe will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and sustain profitability, and we may never do so. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nFinancial operations overview\nTo date, our net product revenues have consisted primarily of sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States and sales of Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States. Our process for recognizing revenue is described below under Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates-Revenue recognition\u201d.\nRoche and the SMA Foundation Collaboration. In November 2011, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or licensing agreement, with Roche and the SMA Foundation pursuant to which we are collaborating with Roche and the SMA Foundation to further develop and commercialize compounds identified under our spinal muscular atrophy program with the SMA Foundation. The research component of this agreement terminated effective December 31, 2014. The licensing agreement included a $30 million upfront payment made in 2011 which was recognized on a deferred basis over the research term, and the potential for up to $460 million in milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\nIn August 2013, we announced the selection of a development candidate, RG7800. The achievement of this milestone triggered a $10.0 million payment to us from Roche, which we recorded as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIn January 2014, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical program for RG7800, which triggered a $7.5 million milestone payment to us from Roche which we recorded as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn November 2014, we announced that our joint development program in SMA with Roche and the SMA Foundation, or SMAF has started a Phase 2 study for RG7800 in adult and pediatric patients. The achievement of this milestone triggered a $10.0 million payment to us from Roche which we recorded as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn October 2017, we announced that the joint development program in SMA with Roche and SMAF had transitioned into the pivotal second part of its study evaluating the efficacy and safety of RG7916 in pediatric and adult Type 2/3 SMA patients. The achievement of this milestone triggered a $20.0 million payment to us from Roche which we recorded as collaboration revenue at time of achievement.\nIn November 2019, we announced that the FDA accepted the filing of and granted priority review for the NDA for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA. The filing acceptance by the FDA triggered a $15.0 million payment to us from Roche which we recorded as collaboration revenue at time of achievement.\nThe remaining potential research and development event milestones that can be received as of December 31, 2019 is $72.5 million. The remaining potential sales milestones as of December 31, 2019 is $325.0 million upon achievement of certain sales events. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive up to double digit royalties on worldwide annual net sales of a commercial product.\nGrant revenue. From time to time, we receive grant funding from various institutions and governmental bodies. The grants are typically for early discovery research, and generally such grant programs last from two to five years.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expenses consist of the costs associated with our research activities, as well as the costs associated with our drug discovery efforts, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings. Our research and development expenses consist of:\nTable 355: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third-party contract research organizations and investigative sites, third-party manufacturing organizations and consultants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 356: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>employee-related expenses, which include salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation, for the personnel involved in our drug discovery and development activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 357: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment, and laboratory and other supplies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects, including our drug development programs. We track expenses related to our clinical programs and certain preclinical programs on a per project basis.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to fluctuate in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly in connection with Study 041 and other studies for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, our activities under our gene therapy, splicing, Bio-e and oncology programs, our studies of Translarna for additional indications, and performance of our FDA post-marketing requirements with respect to Emflaza in the United States. The timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the outcome of our ongoing clinical trials and the costs associated with our planned clinical trials. The timing and amount of these expenses will also depend on the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our products or product candidates and the related expansion of our research and development organization, regulatory requirements, advancement of our preclinical programs, and product and product candidate manufacturing costs.\nThe following table provides research and development expense for our most advanced principal product development programs, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 358: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Translarna (nmDMD, aniridia and Dravet)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bio-e\n</td> <td>10,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gene therapy\n</td> <td>62,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oncology\n</td> <td>21,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Next generation nonsense readthrough\n</td> <td>4,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Emflaza\n</td> <td>22,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Akcea\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other research and preclinical\n</td> <td>42,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe successful development of our product and product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 359: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the scope, rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 360: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the potential benefits of our product and product candidates over other therapies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 361: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for our product or any of our product candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future, including our ability to negotiate pricing and reimbursement terms acceptable to us;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 362: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>clinical trial results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 363: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the terms and timing of regulatory approvals; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 364: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our products or product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidates. For example, if the EMA or FDA or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of any of our products or product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel, including share-based compensation expenses, in our executive, legal, business development, finance, accounting, information technology and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expense; advertising and promotional expenses; costs associated with industry and trade shows; and professional fees for legal services, including patent-related expenses, accounting services and miscellaneous selling costs.\nWe expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods in connection with our continued efforts to commercialize our products, including increased payroll, expanded infrastructure, commercial operations, increased consulting, legal, accounting and investor relations expenses.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest income earned on investments and interest expense from the Convertible Notes outstanding and interest expense from the Credit Agreement.\nCritical accounting policies\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOf our policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and complex judgment, involving critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements:\n\u2022Revenue recognition\n\u2022Convertible notes offering\n\u2022Income taxes\n\u2022Business combinations and asset acquisitions\n\u2022Indefinite-lived intangible assets\nRevenue recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d. ASU No. 2014-9 eliminated transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Subtopic 605-15, Revenue Recognition-Products (Topic 605) and replaced it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASC Topic 606 requires\nentities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606 using the modified retrospective approach, a practical expedient permitted under Topic 606, and applied this approach only to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. We calculated a one-time transition adjustment of $3.3 million, which was recorded on January 1, 2018 to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, related to the product sales of Emflaza. The ASC 606 transition adjustment recorded for Emflaza resulted in sales being recognized earlier than under Topic 605, as the deferred revenue recognition model (sell-through) is not allowed under Topic 606. The one-time adjustment consisted of $3.9 million in deferred revenue offset by $0.6 million of variable consideration. The information presented for the periods prior to January 1, 2018 has not been adjusted and is reported under Topic 605.\nPeriods prior to January 1, 2018\nWe recognize revenue when amounts are realized or realizable and earned. Revenue is considered realizable and earned when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection of the amounts due are reasonably assured.\nNet product sales\nPrior to the second quarter of 2017, our net product sales have consisted primarily of sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the U.S. We recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Subtopic 605-15, Revenue Recognition-Products.\nWe have recorded revenue on sales where Translarna is available either on a commercial basis or through a reimbursed EAP program. Orders for Translarna are generally received from hospital and retail pharmacies and our third-party partner distributors. Our third-party distributors act as intermediaries between us and end users and do not typically stock significant quantities of Translarna. The ultimate payor for Translarna is typically a government authority or institution or a third-party health insurer.\nIn May 2017, we began the commercialization of Emflaza in the U.S. We recorded product revenue related to the sales of Emflaza in the U.S. in accordance with ASC 605-15, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title of the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer has been reasonably assured. Due to the early stage of the product launch, we determined that we were not able to reliably make certain estimates, including returns, necessary to recognize product revenue upon shipment to distributors. As a result, we recorded net product revenue for Emflaza using a deferred revenue recognition model (sell-through). Under the deferred revenue model, we did not recognize revenue until Emflaza was shipped to the specialty pharmacy. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we evaluated and determined that we had sufficient volume of historical activity and visibility into the distribution channel to reasonably make all estimates required under ASC 605 to recognize revenue upon shipment to its specialty pharmacy. The change from the sell-through model to recognizing revenue upon shipment to specialty pharmacies during the fourth quarter of 2017 was immaterial to the financial statements.\nWe record revenue net of estimated third-party discounts and rebates. Allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time revenues from product sales are recognized. Allowances for government and other third-party rebates and discounts are established or estimated at the time of delivery. These allowances are adjusted to reflect known changes in factors and may impact such allowances in the quarter those changes are known. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized Translarna net sales of $145.2 million and Emflaza net sales of $28.8 million.\nWe expect that net product sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD will fluctuate quarter-over-quarter. In some countries, including those in Latin America, orders for named patient sales or by governmental buyers may be for multiple months of therapy which can lead to an unevenness in orders. In addition, net product sales may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter as a result of government actions, economic pressures and political unrest. Net product sales may be significantly impacted by multiple factors, including, among other things, decisions by regulatory authorities, in particular the FDA, the EMA and ANVISA, with respect to our submissions for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and our ability to successfully negotiate favorable pricing and reimbursement processes on a timely basis in the countries in which we have or may obtain regulatory approval, including the United States, EEA and other territories.\nPeriods commencing January 1, 2018\nOur net product revenue primarily consists of sales of Translarna in territories outside of the U.S. and sales of Emflaza in the U.S., both for the treatment of DMD.\nNet Product Revenue\nWe recognize revenue when performance obligations with customers have been satisfied. Our performance obligations are to provide products based on customer orders from distributors, hospitals, specialty pharmacies or retail pharmacies. The performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time when our customer obtains control of the product, which is typically upon delivery. We invoice customers after the products have been delivered and invoice payments are generally due within 30 to 90 days of invoice date. We determine the transaction price based on fixed consideration in its contractual agreements. Contract liabilities arise in certain circumstances when consideration is due for goods not yet provided. As we have identified only one distinct performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated entirely to the product sale. In determining the transaction price, a significant financing component does not exist since the timing from when we deliver product to when the customers pay for the product is typically less than one year. Customers in certain countries pay in advance of product delivery. In those instances, payment and delivery typically occur in the same month.\nWe record product sales net of any variable consideration, which includes discounts, allowances, rebates related to Medicaid and other government pricing programs, and distribution fees. and distribution fees. We use the expected value or most likely amount method when estimating variable consideration, unless discount or rebate terms are specified within contracts. The identified variable consideration is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time revenues from product sales are recognized. These estimates for variable consideration are adjusted to reflect known changes in factors and may impact such estimates in the quarter those changes are known. Revenue recognized does not include amounts of variable consideration that are constrained. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net product sales outside of the United States were $190.3 million and $171.0 million respectively, and net product sales in the United States were $101.0 million and $92.0 million respectively.\nIn relation to customer contracts, we incur costs to fulfill a contract but do not incur costs to obtain a contract. These costs to fulfill a contract do not meet the criteria for capitalization and are expensed as incurred.\nUpon adoption of ASC Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, we have elected the following practical expedients:\nTable 365: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Portfolio Approach - We applied the Portfolio Approach to contract reviews within identified revenue streams that have similar characteristics and we believe this approach would not differ materially than if applying ASC Topic 606 to each individual contract.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 366: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant Financing Component - We expect the period between when an we transfer a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for the good or service to be one year or less.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 367: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Immaterial Performance Obligations - We disregard promises deemed to be immaterial in the context of the contract.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 368: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Shipping and Handling Activities - We consider any shipping and handling costs that are incurred after the customer has obtained control of the product as a cost to fulfill a promise.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Shipping and handling costs associated with finished goods delivered to customers are recorded as a selling expense.\nConvertible Notes Offerings\nIn September 2019, we issued $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes, which included an option to purchase up to an additional $37.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes, which was exercised in full by the initial purchasers. The 2026 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 1.50% per year, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. The 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on September 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The net proceeds to us from the offering were $279.3 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.\nThe 2026 Convertible Notes are governed by an indenture, or the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture, with U.S Bank National Association as trustee, or the 2026 Convertible Notes Trustee.\nIn August 2015, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 3.00% per year, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2016. The 2022 Convertible Notes will mature on August 15, 2022, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The net proceeds to us from the offering were $145.4 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes are governed by an indenture, or the 2022 Convertible Notes Indenture, with U.S Bank National Association as trustee, or the 2022 Convertible Notes Trustee.\nAs the Convertible Notes contained embedded conversion features, we separated the Convertible Notes into liability and equity components, in accordance with the guidance in ASC 815. The carrying amount for each of the liability components was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying\namount of each of the equity components representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the respective liability component from the par value of the Convertible Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of each of the liability components over its respective carrying amount, referred to as the debt discount, is amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of each of the Convertible Notes in accordance with ASC 835. The equity component is not re-measured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The equity components recorded at each issuance was recorded in additional paid-in capital.\nIn accounting for the transaction costs related to the issuance of each of the Convertible Notes, we allocated the total costs incurred to the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes based on their relative values in accordance with ASC 470. Transaction costs attributable to each of the liability components are amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of each of the Convertible Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component are netted with the equity components in stockholders' equity. Additionally, we initially recorded net deferred tax liabilities in connection with each of the Convertible Notes.\nIncome taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of approximately $267.1 million and $180.5 million, respectively. The change in the valuation allowance during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $86.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively. A valuation allowance has been recorded since, in the judgment of management, these assets are not more likely than not to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences and carryforwards become deductible or are utilized. As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately $433.3 million, $224.4 million, and $8.4 million of federal, state, and ex-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, respectively. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, we no longer exclude tax benefits that arose directly from equity compensation in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting in its U.S. federal and U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards.\nDuring 2018, we acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, as part of the acquisition of Agilis. This asset is currently considered an indefinite-lived intangible with no related book amortization and tested for impairment, annually. As the IPR&D has no tax basis and is an indefinite-lived intangible, the deferred tax liability created at the time of acquisition is not considered positive evidence of future income and is presented as a deferred tax liability in the balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2019, research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes are approximately $14.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively. In addition, the Orphan Drug Credit Carryover available as of December 31, 2019 is approximately $85.2 million. As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation, federal net operating losses, or NOLs, generated in 2018 carryforward indefinitely, however, we have federal net operating losses that pre-date U.S. tax reform legislation which begin to expire in 2021 and federal credit carryforwards that begin to expire in 2019. State net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2030, and the state credit carryforwards began to expire in 2016. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 subject the future utilization of net operating losses and certain other tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, to an annual limitation in the event of certain ownership changes, as defined. We have undergone an ownership change and have determined that a change in ownership\u201d as defined by IRC Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, did occur in June of 2013. Accordingly, about $231.5 million of our NOL carryforwards are limited and we can only use $16.7 million for the first five years from the ownership change and $5.7 million per year going forward. Therefore, $169.2 million of the NOLs will be freed up over the next 20 years and $62.3 million are expected to expire unused which are not included in the deferred tax assets listed above. In summary, including the NOLs expected to expire, there are $495.7 million of NOLs available, out of which $231.5 million are limited by IRC Section 382. At December 31, 2019, there is $333.2 million available for immediate use and an additional $5.7 million will free up in 2020.\nBusiness combinations and asset acquisitions\nWe evaluate acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the screen is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen is not met, further determination is required as to whether or not we have acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs, which would meet the requirements of a business. If determined to be a business combination, we account for the transaction under the acquisition method of accounting as indicated in ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations\u201d, which requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement point. Accordingly, we recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business\ncombinations, including contingent assets and liabilities, and non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on the fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition. In accordance with ASC 805, we recognize and measure goodwill as of the acquisition date, as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired.\nThe consideration for our business acquisitions may include future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event or events. The obligations for such contingent consideration payments are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. The contingent consideration obligations are then evaluated each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, other than changes due to payments, are recognized as a gain or loss and recorded within the change in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIf determined to be an asset acquisition, we account for the transaction under ASC 805-50, which requires the acquiring entity in an asset acquisition to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the cost to the acquiring entity on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to consideration given. No gain or loss is recognized as of the date of acquisition unless the fair value of noncash assets given as consideration differs from the assets' carrying amounts on the acquiring entity's books. Consideration transferred that is noncash will be measured based on either the cost (which shall be measured based on the fair value of the consideration given) or the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever is more reliably measurable. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition and any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to the identifiable assets based on relative fair values.\nContingent consideration payments in asset acquisitions are recognized when the contingency is resolved and the consideration is paid or becomes payable (unless the contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative, in which case the amount becomes part of the basis in the asset acquired). Upon recognition of the contingent consideration payment, the amount is included in the cost of the acquired asset or group of assets.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of IPR&D. IPR&D acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination is capitalized if the projects will be further developed or have an alternative future use; otherwise they are expensed. The fair values of IPR&D projects acquired in business combinations are capitalized. Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of the IPR&D acquired in a business combination. We utilize the \"income method\u201d, and use estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These projections are based on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection, and expected pricing and industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. These assets are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the projects, at which time the assets are amortized over the remaining useful life or written off, as appropriate. Intangible assets with indefinite lives, including IPR&D, are tested for impairment if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum, annually. However, an entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if the entity determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. Otherwise, no further impairment testing is required. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test consists of a one-step analysis that compares the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We consider many factors in evaluating whether the value of its intangible assets with indefinite lives may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to, expected growth rates, the cost of equity and debt capital, general economic conditions, our outlook and market performance of our industry and recent and forecasted financial performance. We performed our annual test for its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2019 and concluded that no impairment exists as of December 31, 2019.\nFor a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table summarizes revenues and selected expense and other income data for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Table 369: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n2019 vs. 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net product revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration and grant revenue\n</td> <td>15,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset\n</td> <td>12,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(535\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangible asset\n</td> <td>27,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expense\n</td> <td>257,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>202,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration\n</td> <td>48,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(12,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>13,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>(11,650\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,679\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet product revenue. Net product revenue was $291.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $28.3 million, or 11%, from net product revenue of $263.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net product revenue was primarily due to the increase in net product sales in existing markets where Translarna is available as well as continued geographic expansion into new territories, in addition to an increase in net product sales of Emflaza.\nCollaboration and grant revenue. Collaboration and grant revenue was $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $13.9 million, over 100%, from collaboration and grant revenue of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in collaboration and grant revenue was primarily due to the $15.0 million milestone achieved during the fourth quarter of 2019 from Roche, which was triggered in November 2019 upon the FDA's acceptance of the filing of the NDA for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA.\nCost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset. Cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset, was $12.1 million for the year end December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 4%, from $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of product sales consist primarily of royalty payments associated with Emflaza and Translarna net product sales, excluding contingent payments to Marathon Pharmaceuticals, LLC (now known as Complete Pharma Holdings, LLC), or Marathon, and costs associated with product sold during the period. The decrease year over year is primarily due to a $1.8 million inventory write down for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to inventory labeling changes.\nAmortization of acquired intangible asset. Amortization of acquired intangible asset was $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $4.8 million, or 21%, from $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. These amounts are related to the acquisition of all rights to Emflaza acquired in May 2017, Marathon contingent payments, and our Waylivra and Tegsedi intangible assets. The increase is primarily related to additional Marathon contingent payments. The amount allocated to the Emflaza intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of approximately seven years from the date of the completion of the acquisition of all rights to Emflaza, the period of estimated future cash flows. The Marathon contingent payments are amortized prospectively as incurred, straight-line, over the remaining useful life of the Emflaza intangible asset. The Waylivra and Tegsedi assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of approximately ten years, respectively.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense was $257.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $85.5 million, or 50%, compared to $172.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase reflects costs associated with advancing the gene therapy platform and increased investment in research programs, such as our acquisition of PTC743 from BioElectron, which represents $10.1 million of the increase, as well as advancement of the clinical pipeline.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense was $202.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $49.0 million, or 32%, from $153.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The\nincrease was primarily due to continued investment to support our commercial activities including our expanding commercial portfolio.\nChange in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration. Change in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration was $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $29.0 million, or 150%, from $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change is related to the fair valuation of the potential future consideration to be paid to former equity holders of Agilis, as a result of our merger with Agilis which closed in August 2018. Changes in the fair value were due to the re-calculation of discounted cash flows for the passage of time and changes to certain other estimated assumptions.\nInterest expense, net. Net interest expense was $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1%, from net interest expense of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to increased interest income from investments, which partially offset current year interest expense recorded from the 2022 and 2026 Convertible Notes and the Credit Agreement.\nOther income, net. Other income, net was $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $13.6 million, over 100%, from other income, net of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in other income, net resulted primarily from a foreign exchange gain from the remeasurement of our intercompany loan and an unrealized gain on our equity investment in ClearPoint Neuro, Inc. (formerly MRI Interventions, Inc.), or our Equity Investment, of $2.2 million, partially offset by exchange rate changes in the current period.\nIncome tax (expense) benefit. Income tax expense was $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a change of $11.7 million, over 100%, from income tax benefit of $0.03 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We incurred income tax expense in various ex-U.S. jurisdictions, and our ex-U.S. tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of pre-tax earnings among these different jurisdictions. We are paying minimum income taxes in the United States because of incurred losses in the various state jurisdictions.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table summarizes revenues and selected expense and other income data for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 370: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n2018 vs. 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net product revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration and grant revenue\n</td> <td>1,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,597\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset\n</td> <td>12,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangible asset\n</td> <td>22,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expense\n</td> <td>171,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>153,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration\n</td> <td>19,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(12,554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,094\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,279\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,335\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet product revenue. Net product revenue was $263.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $88.9 million, or 51%, from net product revenue of $174.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net product revenue was primarily due to the increase in net product sales of $25.8 million in existing markets where Translarna is available as well as continued geographic expansion into new territories, in addition to an increase in $63.2 million in net product sales of Emflaza, which launched domestically in May 2017.\nCollaboration and grant revenue. Collaboration and grant revenue was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $18.6 million, or 91%, from collaboration and grant revenue of $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in collaboration and grant revenue was primarily due to the $20.0 million milestone achieved during the fourth quarter of 2017 from Roche. In October 2017, we announced that Sunfish, a two-part clinical trial in pediatric and adult type 2 and type 3 spinal muscular atrophy initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016, had transitioned into the pivotal second part of its study which triggered the milestone payment.\nCost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset. Cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset, was $12.7 million for the year end December 31, 2018, an increase of $8.1 million, or 177%, from $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of product sales consist primarily of royalty payments associated with Emflaza and Translarna net product sales and costs associated with Emflaza and Translarna product sold during the period. For Translarna sold in 2017, the majority of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed prior to January 1, 2017 as research and development expenses.\nAmortization of acquired intangible asset. Amortization of acquired intangible asset was $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $7.5 million, or 49%, from $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is related to the acquisition of all rights to Emflaza, acquired in May 2017 and Marathon contingent payments . The amount allocated to the Emflaza intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of approximately seven years from the date of the completion of the acquisition of all rights to Emflaza, the period of estimated future cash flows. The Marathon contingent payments are amortized prospectively as incurred, straight-line, over the remaining useful life of the Emflaza intangible asset.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense was $172.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $54.5 million, or 46%, compared to $117.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase reflects costs associated with advancing the gene therapy platform and increased investment in research programs as well as advancement of the clinical pipeline.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense was $153.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $32.3 million or 27% from $121.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to continued investment in commercial activities for Emflaza and Translarna.\nChange in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration. Change in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration was $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change is related to the fair valuation of the potential future consideration to be paid to former Agilis' equity holders as a result of the Merger, which closed in August 2018. Changes in the fair value were due to the re-calculation of discounted cash flows for the passage of time and changes to certain other estimated assumptions.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net was $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.5 million, or 4%, from interest expense, net of $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to current year interest expense recorded from the Convertible Notes and the Credit Agreement partially offset by interest income from investments.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income, net was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.4 million, or 110%, from other expense, net of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in other income (expense), net resulted primarily from exchange rate changes in the current period.\nIncome tax benefit (expense). Income tax benefit was $0.03 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an change of $1.4 million, or 102%, from income tax expense of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We incurred income tax expense in various foreign jurisdictions, and our ex-U.S. tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of pre-tax earnings among these different jurisdictions. We are paying minimum income taxes in the United States because of incurred losses in the various state jurisdictions. The ex-U.S. tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily driven by the Akcea upfront licensing fee.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nSources of liquidity\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses.\nAs a growing commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, we are engaging in significant commercialization efforts for our products while also devoting a substantial portion of our efforts on research and development related to our products, product candidates and other programs. To date, almost all of our product revenue has been attributable to sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States and from Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States. Our ongoing ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is dependent upon our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in Brazil and in the EEA and secure market access through commercial programs following the conclusion of pricing and reimbursement terms at sustainable levels in the member states of the EEA or through EAP programs in the EEA and other territories. The marketing authorization requires annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization and is subject to the specific obligation to\nconduct Study 041. Our ability to generate product revenue from Emflaza will largely depend on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors.\nOn August 23, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Agilis for total upfront consideration comprised of $49.2 million in cash and 3,500,907 shares of our common stock, which was determined by dividing $150.0 million by the volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock on Nasdaq for the 10 consecutive trading-day period ending on the second trading-day immediately preceding the closing. Agilis equityholders may become entitled to receive contingent payments from us based on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and net sales milestones as well as based upon a percentage of net sales of certain products. Under the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 19, 2018, or the Merger Agreement, by and among us, Agility Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned, indirect subsidiary, Agilis and, solely in its capacity as the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of the equityholders of Agilis, Shareholder Representative Services LLC, we are required to pay $40.0 million of the development milestone payments upon the passing of the second anniversary of the closing of the Merger, August 23, 2020, regardless of whether the applicable milestones have been achieved.\nWe have historically financed our operations primarily through the issuance and sale of our common stock in public offerings, our at the market offering\u201d of our common stock, the private placements of our preferred stock, collaborations, bank debt, convertible debt financings, the Credit Agreement and grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.\nIn February 2014, we closed a public offering of 5,163,265 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $24.50 per share, including 673,469 shares pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of an overallotment option. We received net proceeds from the public offering of approximately $118.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn October 2014, we closed a public offering of 3,450,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $36.25 per share, including 450,000 shares pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds from the public offering of approximately $117.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn August 2015, we closed a private offering of $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, including the exercise by the initial purchasers of an option to purchase an additional $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes bear cash interest payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2016. The 2022 Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of ours and will mature on August 15, 2022, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $145.4 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.\nHolders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15, 2022 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing on or after September 30, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period\u201d) in which the trading price (as defined in the 2022 Convertible Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) during any period after we have issued notice of redemption until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the relevant redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 15, 2022, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be converted and deliver shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes being converted.\nThe conversion rate for the 2022 Convertible Notes was initially, and remains, 17.7487 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $56.34 per share of our common stock.\nWe were not permitted to redeem the 2022 Convertible Notes prior to August 20, 2018. As of August 20, 2018, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2022 Convertible Notes, at our option, on or after August 20, 2018 if the last reported\nsale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect on the last trading day of, and for at least 19 other trading days (whether or not consecutive) during, any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2022 Convertible Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire the 2022 Convertible Notes periodically. There have been no redemptions to date.\nIf we undergo a fundamental change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their 2022 Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes represent senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated, effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries. The 2022 Convertible Notes Indenture contains customary events of default with respect to the 2022 Convertible Notes, including that upon certain events of default (including our failure to make any payment of principal or interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes when due and payable) occurring and continuing, the 2022 Convertible Notes Trustee by notice to us, or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes by notice to us and the 2022 Convertible Notes Trustee, may, and the 2022 Convertible Notes Trustee at the request of such holders (subject to the provisions of the 2022 Convertible Notes Indenture) shall, declare 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the 2022 Convertible Notes to be due and payable. In case of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, involving us or a significant subsidiary, 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes will automatically become due and payable. Upon such a declaration of acceleration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately.\nOn May 5, 2017, we entered into the Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial which provides for a senior secured term loan facility of $60.0 million, of which $40.0 million was drawn by us on May 5, 2017. Our ability to draw on the remaining $20.0 million under the senior secured term loan facility expired on December 31, 2018. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is May 1, 2021, unless terminated earlier. The facility is structured to require only monthly interest payments for the initial two years with principal amortization beginning in years three and four. The facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, (with a LIBOR floor rate of 1.00%) plus 6.15%, as well as additional upfront and administrative fees and expenses.\nIn April 2018, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. We issued and sold an aggregate of 4,600,000 shares of common stock under the registration statement at a public offering price of $27.04 per share, including 600,000 shares issued upon exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds of approximately $117.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn January 2019, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. We issued and sold an aggregate of 7,563,725 shares of common stock under the registration statement at a public offering price of $30.20 per share, including 843,725 shares issued upon exercise by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional shares in February 2019. We received net proceeds of approximately $224.2 million after deducting agent discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn August 2019, we entered into the Sales Agreement with the Sales Agents, pursuant to which, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $125.0 million from time to time through the Sales Agents by any method that is deemed to be an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued and sold an aggregate of 63,926 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement at a weighted average public offering price of $46.60 per share. We received net proceeds of $2.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn September 2019, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. We issued and sold an aggregate of 2,475,248 shares of common stock under the registration statement at a public offering price of $40.40 per share. The offering included an option to purchase up to an additional 371,287 shares for a period of 30 days following the offering. This option was not exercised by the underwriter. We received net proceeds of $97.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn September 2019, we issued $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes, which included an option to purchase up to an additional $37.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes, which was exercised in full by the initial purchasers. The 2026 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 1.50% per year, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. The 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on September 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. We received net proceeds of $279.3 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.\nHolders may convert their 2026 Convertible Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2026 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing on or after December 31, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price (as defined in the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) during any period after we have issued notice of redemption until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the relevant redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after March 15, 2026, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2026 Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or any combination thereof at our election.\nThe conversion rate for the 2026 Convertible Notes was initially, and remains, 19.0404 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $52.52 per share of our common stock. The conversion rate may be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.\nWe are not permitted to redeem the 2026 Convertible Notes prior to September 20, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2026 Convertible Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of its common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect on the last trading day of, and for at least 19 other trading days (whether or not consecutive) during, any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2026 Convertible Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire the 2026 Convertible Notes periodically.\nIf we undergo a fundamental change\u201d (as defined in the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their 2026 Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe 2026 Convertible Notes represent senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated, effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries. The 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture contains customary events of default with respect to the 2026 Convertible Notes, including that upon certain events of default (including our failure to make any payment of principal or interest on the 2026 Convertible Notes when due and payable) occurring and continuing, the 2026 Convertible Notes Trustee by notice to us, or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes by notice to us and the Convertible Notes Trustee, may, and the 2026 Convertible Notes Trustee at the request of such holders (subject to the provisions of the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture) shall, declare 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the 2026 Convertible Notes to be due and payable. In case of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, involving us or a significant subsidiary, 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on the 2026 Convertible Notes will automatically become due and payable. Upon such a declaration of acceleration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately.\nCash flows\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $686.6 million.\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows and our capital expenditures for the periods indicated.

The cash used in operating activities primarily related to supporting clinical development, including the manufacture of drug product, commercial launch activities for Emflaza and Translarna, and costs associated with the expansion of our international infrastructure for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $387.2 million and $42.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to purchases of marketable securities, the acquisition of product rights, purchases of fixed assets, and our Equity Investment, partially offset by net sales and redemptions of marketable securities. The cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to the business acquisition of Agilis, purchases of fixed assets, and the acquisition of product rights partially offset by net sales and redemptions of marketable securities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and was primarily related to net sales and redemptions of marketable securities, partially offset by the cash used in the acquisition of Emflaza.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to net proceeds received from our public stock offerings, net proceeds received from our at the market offering\u201d of our common stock, net proceeds received from our convertible notes offering, the exercise of options, and issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, partially offset by repayment on our senior secured term loan. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to net proceeds received from our public stock offering, the exercise of options, and issuance of stock under the ESPP. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the exercise of options and issuance of stock under the ESPP.\nFunding requirements\nWe anticipate that our expenses will continue to increase in connection with our commercialization efforts in the United States, the EEA, Latin America and other territories, including the expansion of our infrastructure and corresponding sales and marketing, legal and regulatory, distribution and manufacturing and administrative and employee-based expenses.

With respect to our outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes, cash interest payments are payable on a semi-annual basis in arrears, which will require total funding of $4.3 million annually. Additionally, under the terms of our Credit Agreement cash interest payments are payable monthly in arrears. Furthermore, since we are a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as such. These costs include significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.\nWe will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and sustain profitability, and we may never do so. We may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs primarily through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product and product candidates and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed or on attractive terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 404: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations, not yet commenced (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations, including interest (3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>481,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum royalty (4)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit agreement, including interest (5)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred consideration payable (6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments (7)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>673,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 405: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Obligations stem from lease agreement entered into with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in August 2019 relating to the lease of approximately 185,000 square feet of office, manufacturing and laboratory space at a facility located in Hopewell Township, New Jersey.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nWe are a science-driven global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically-differentiated medicines that provide benefits to patients with rare disorders. Our ability to commercialize products is the foundation that drives our continued investment in a robust diversified pipeline of transformative medicines and our mission to provide access to best-in-class treatments for patients who have an unmet medical need. Our strategy is to bring best-in-class therapies with differentiated clinical benefit to patients affected by rare disorders and to leverage our global commercial infrastructure to maximize value for our patients and other stakeholders. We have a portfolio pipeline that includes commercial products as well as product candidates in various stages of development, including clinical, pre-clinical and research and discovery stages, focused on the development of new treatments for multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases and oncology.\nWe have two products, Translarna\u2122 (ataluren) and Emflaza\u2122 (deflazacort), for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, a rare, life threatening disorder. Translarna has marketing authorization in the European Economic Area, or EEA, for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or nmDMD, in ambulatory patients aged two years and older and in Brazil for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $190.0 million in sales of Translarna. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to Translarna for all indications in all territories. Emflaza is approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD in patients two years and older. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Emflaza achieved net sales of $101.0 million.\nOur marketing authorization for Translarna in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment. In July 2019, the European Commission renewed our marketing authorization, making it effective, unless extended, through August 5, 2020. In February 2020, we submitted a marketing authorization renewal request to the EMA. This marketing authorization is further subject to a specific obligation to conduct and submit the results of a18-month, placebo-controlled trial, followed by an 18-month open-label extension, which we refer to together as Study 041. The final report on the trial and open-label extension is to be submitted by us to the EMA by the end of the third quarter of 2022.\nEach country, including each member state of the EEA, has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations. In order to commence commercial sale of product pursuant to our Translarna marketing authorization in any particular country in the EEA, we must finalize pricing and reimbursement negotiations with the applicable government body in such country. As a result, our commercial launch will continue to be on a country-by-country basis. We also have made, and expect to continue to make, product available under early access programs, or EAP programs, both in countries in the EEA and other territories. Our ability to negotiate, secure and maintain reimbursement for product under commercial and EAP programs can be subject to challenge in any particular country and can also be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments in such country.\nThere is substantial risk that if we are unable to renew our EEA marketing authorization during any annual renewal cycle, or if our product label is materially restricted, or if Study 041 does not provide the data necessary to maintain our marketing authorization, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna in the EEA and other territories.\nTranslarna is an investigational new drug in the United States. During the first quarter of 2017, we filed a New Drug Application, or NDA, for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD over protest with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In October 2017, the Office of Drug Evaluation I of the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the NDA, stating that it was unable to approve the application in its current form. In response, we filed a formal dispute resolution request with the Office of New Drugs of the FDA. In February 2018, the Office of New Drugs of the FDA denied our appeal of the Complete Response Letter. In its response, the Office of New Drugs recommended a possible path forward for the ataluren NDA submission based on the accelerated approval pathway. This would involve a re-submission of an NDA containing the current data on effectiveness of ataluren with new data to be generated on dystrophin production in nmDMD patients' muscles. We intend to follow the FDA's recommendation and will collect, using newer technologies via procedures and methods that we designed, such dystrophin data in a new study, Study 045, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect that a potential re-submission of an NDA could occur in mid-year 2020. Additionally, should a re-submission of an NDA receive accelerated approval, the Office of New Drugs stated that Study 041, which is currently enrolling, could serve as the confirmatory post-approval trial required in connection with the accelerated approval framework.\nThere is substantial risk that Study 045, or any other studies we may use to collect the dystrophin data, will not provide the necessary data to support a marketing approval for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the U.S.\nWe hold the rights for the commercialization of Tegsedi\u2122 (inotersen) and Waylivra\u2122 (volanesorsen) for the treatment of rare diseases in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean pursuant to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Akcea Therapeutics, Inc., or Akcea. Tegsedi has received marketing authorization in the United States, EU and Brazil for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis. Waylivra has received marketing authorization in the European Union, or EU, for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS. We anticipate filing for marketing authorization with ANVISA in the second half of 2020.\nWe have a pipeline of gene therapy product candidates for rare monogenic diseases that affect the central nervous system, or CNS, including PTC-AADC for the treatment of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase, or AADC, deficiency, or AADC deficiency, a rare CNS disorder arising from reductions in the enzyme AADC that result from mutations in the dopa decarboxylase gene. We are preparing a biologics license application, or BLA, for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States, which we anticipate submitting to the FDA in the second quarter of 2020. In January 2020, we submitted a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the EEA to the EMA and we expect an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, by the end of 2020.\nWe also have a spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, collaboration with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffman-La Roche Inc., which we refer to collectively as Roche, and the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation, or SMA Foundation. The lead compound in the SMA program is risdiplam (RG7916, RO7034067). Roche submitted an NDA for risdiplam to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date for a decision by the FDA is May 24, 2020. Risdiplam is expected to be indicated in the United States for SMA type 1, 2 and 3 patients, if approved. Roche anticipates submitting an MAA for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA in the EEA in mid-year 2020.\nIn 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of BioElectron Technology Corporation, or BioElectron, including certain compounds that we have begun to develop as part of our Bio-e platform. In 2020, we plan to initiate three trials in this platform with two unique compounds that regulate inflammation and oxidative stress.\nIn addition, we have a pipeline of product candidates and discovery programs that are in early clinical, pre-clinical and research and development stages focused on the development of new treatments for multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases and oncology.\nOverview-Funding\nThe success of our products and any other product candidates we may develop, depends largely on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement from governments and third-party insurers. During 2019, our revenues were generated from sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in countries where we were able to obtain acceptable commercial pricing and reimbursement terms and in select countries where we are permitted to distribute Translarna under our EAP programs, and from sales of Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States.\nSee Item 1. Business-Commercial Matters-Market Access Considerations\u201d for additional information and Item 1A. Risk Factors-Commercialization of Translarna has been in, and is expected to continue to take place in, countries that tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues. Failure to obtain and maintain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and other countries where Translarna is available would delay or prevent us from marketing our product in such regions, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\u201d\nOn April 20, 2017, we completed our acquisition of all rights to Emflaza, or the Transaction, for total upfront consideration comprised of $75.0 million in cash, funded through cash on hand, and 6,683,598 shares of our common stock, which was determined by dividing $65.0 million by the volume weighted average price per share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq for the 15 trading-day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the closing.\nOn May 5, 2017, we entered into a credit and security agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with MidCap Financial Trust, or MidCap Financial, as administrative agent and MidCap Financial and other certain institutions as lenders thereto, that provides for a senior secured term loan facility of $60 million, of which $40 million was drawn by us on May 5, 2017. Our ability to draw on the remaining $20.0 million under the senior secured term loan facility expired on December 31, 2018. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is May 1, 2021, unless terminated earlier.\nIn April 2018, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. We issued and sold an aggregate of 4,600,000 shares of common stock under the registration statement at a public offering price of $27.04 per share, including 600,000 shares issued upon exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase\nadditional shares. We received net proceeds of approximately $117.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nOn August 23, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Agilis Biotherapeutics, Inc., or Agilis, for total upfront consideration comprised of $49.2 million in cash and 3,500,907 shares of our common stock, which was determined by dividing $150.0 million by the volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock on Nasdaq for the 10 consecutive trading-day period ending on the second trading-day immediately preceding the closing.\nIn January 2019, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. We issued and sold an aggregate of 7,563,725 shares of common stock under the registration statement at a public offering price of $30.20 per share, including 843,725 shares issued upon exercise by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional shares in February 2019. We received net proceeds of approximately $224.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn August 2019, we entered into an At the Market Offering Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, or together, the Sales Agents, pursuant to which, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $125.0 million from time to time through the Sales Agents by any method that is deemed to be an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued and sold an aggregate of 63,926 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement at a weighted average public offering price of $46.60 per share. We received net proceeds of $2.6 million after deducting agent discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn September 2019, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. We issued and sold an aggregate of 2,475,248 shares of common stock under the registration statement at a public offering price of $40.40 per share. The offering included an option to purchase up to an additional 371,287 shares for a period of 30 days following the offering. This option was not exercised by the underwriter. We received net proceeds of $97.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn September 2019, we issued $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due September 15, 2026, or the 2026 Convertible Notes, which included an option to purchase up to an additional $37.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes, which was exercised in full by the initial purchasers. The 2026 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 1.50% per year, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. The 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on September 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. We received net proceeds of $279.3 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.\nOn October 25, 2019, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of BioElectron for total upfront consideration of $10.0 million in cash less (i) transaction expenses incurred by BioElectron, (ii) the amount of outstanding indebtedness of BioElectron including a $4.0 million loan advance to BioElectron plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (iii) $1.5 million held in an escrow account to secure potential indemnification obligations owed to us.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through our offering of 3.00% convertible senior notes due August 15, 2022, or the 2022 Convertible Notes offering, our offering of 1.50% convertible senior notes due September 15, 2026, or the 2026 Convertible Notes, and, together with the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes, our public offerings of common stock in February 2014, in October 2014, in April 2018, in January 2019, and in September 2019, the common stock issued in our at the marketing offering\u201d, our initial public offering of common stock in June 2013, private placements of our preferred stock, collaborations, bank debt and convertible debt financings, the Credit Agreement and grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates. Since 2014, we have also relied on revenue generated from net sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States, and since May 2017, we have generated revenue from net sales of Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,190.5 million. We had a net loss of $251.6 million and $128.1 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe anticipate that our expenses will continue to increase in connection with our commercialization efforts in the United States, the EEA, Latin America and other territories, including the expansion of our infrastructure and corresponding sales and marketing, legal and regulatory, distribution and manufacturing, including expanding our direct manufacturing capabilities at our new biologics manufacturing facility and administrative and employee-based expenses. In addition to the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur ongoing research and development expenses for our products and product candidates, including our gene therapy, splicing, Bio-e and oncology programs as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, including Study\n041, label extensions and additional indications. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in connection with our efforts to advance our regulatory submissions. We continue to seek marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories that we do not currently have marketing authorization in and we may also seek marketing authorization for Translarna for other indications. We submitted an MAA to the EMA for the treatment of AADC deficiency with PTC-AADC in the EEA and we are preparing a BLA for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States, which we anticipate submitting to the FDA in the second quarter of 2020. We also anticipate filing for marketing authorization for Waylivra with ANVISA in the second half of 2020. These efforts may significantly impact the timing and extent of our commercialization expenses.\nWe may seek to expand and diversify our product pipeline through opportunistically in-licensing or acquiring the rights to products, product candidates or technologies and we may incur expenses, including with respect to transaction costs, subsequent development costs or any upfront, milestone or other payments or other financial obligations associated with any such transaction, which would increase our future capital requirements.\nWith respect to our outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes, cash interest payments are payable on a semi-annual basis in arrears, which require total funding of $4.5 million annually. With respect to our outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes, cash interest payments are payable on a semi-annual basis in arrears, which will require total funding of $4.3 million annually. Additionally, under the terms of our Credit Agreement cash interest payments are payable monthly in arrears. We are also required to pay $40.0 million in development milestone payments upon the passing of the second anniversary of the closing of the Agilis acquisition, August 23, 2020, regardless of whether the applicable milestones have been achieved. In addition, Akcea is eligible to receive from us an additional milestone payment of $4.0 million upon receipt of regulatory approval for Waylivra from ANVISA. Furthermore, since we are a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as such including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. See also, The price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock and lawsuits against us and our officers and directors\u201d under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Common Stock.\nWe will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and sustain profitability, and we may never do so. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nFinancial operations overview\nTo date, our net product revenues have consisted primarily of sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States and sales of Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States. Our process for recognizing revenue is described below under Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates-Revenue recognition\u201d.\nRoche and the SMA Foundation Collaboration. In November 2011, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or licensing agreement, with Roche and the SMA Foundation pursuant to which we are collaborating with Roche and the SMA Foundation to further develop and commercialize compounds identified under our spinal muscular atrophy program with the SMA Foundation. The research component of this agreement terminated effective December 31, 2014. The licensing agreement included a $30 million upfront payment made in 2011 which was recognized on a deferred basis over the research term, and the potential for up to $460 million in milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\nIn August 2013, we announced the selection of a development candidate, RG7800. The achievement of this milestone triggered a $10.0 million payment to us from Roche, which we recorded as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIn January 2014, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical program for RG7800, which triggered a $7.5 million milestone payment to us from Roche which we recorded as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn November 2014, we announced that our joint development program in SMA with Roche and the SMA Foundation, or SMAF has started a Phase 2 study for RG7800 in adult and pediatric patients. The achievement of this milestone triggered a $10.0 million payment to us from Roche which we recorded as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn October 2017, we announced that the joint development program in SMA with Roche and SMAF had transitioned into the pivotal second part of its study evaluating the efficacy and safety of RG7916 in pediatric and adult Type 2/3 SMA patients. The achievement of this milestone triggered a $20.0 million payment to us from Roche which we recorded as collaboration revenue at time of achievement.\nIn November 2019, we announced that the FDA accepted the filing of and granted priority review for the NDA for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA. The filing acceptance by the FDA triggered a $15.0 million payment to us from Roche which we recorded as collaboration revenue at time of achievement.\nThe remaining potential research and development event milestones that can be received as of December 31, 2019 is $72.5 million. The remaining potential sales milestones as of December 31, 2019 is $325.0 million upon achievement of certain sales events. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive up to double digit royalties on worldwide annual net sales of a commercial product.\nGrant revenue. From time to time, we receive grant funding from various institutions and governmental bodies. The grants are typically for early discovery research, and generally such grant programs last from two to five years.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expenses consist of the costs associated with our research activities, as well as the costs associated with our drug discovery efforts, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings. Our research and development expenses consist of:\n \u2022 external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third-party contract research organizations and investigative sites, third-party manufacturing organizations and consultants; \n \u2022 employee-related expenses, which include salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation, for the personnel involved in our drug discovery and development activities; and \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment, and laboratory and other supplies.  We use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects, including our drug development programs. We track expenses related to our clinical programs and certain preclinical programs on a per project basis.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to fluctuate in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly in connection with Study 041 and other studies for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, our activities under our gene therapy, splicing, Bio-e and oncology programs, our studies of Translarna for additional indications, and performance of our FDA post-marketing requirements with respect to Emflaza in the United States. The timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the outcome of our ongoing clinical trials and the costs associated with our planned clinical trials. The timing and amount of these expenses will also depend on the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our products or product candidates and the related expansion of our research and development organization, regulatory requirements, advancement of our preclinical programs, and product and product candidate manufacturing costs.\nThe following table provides research and development expense for our most advanced principal product development programs, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\n\nThe successful development of our product and product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities; \n \u2022 the potential benefits of our product and product candidates over other therapies; \n \u2022 our ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for our product or any of our product candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future, including our ability to negotiate pricing and reimbursement terms acceptable to us; \n \u2022 clinical trial results; \n \u2022 the terms and timing of regulatory approvals; and \n \u2022 the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights.  A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our products or product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidates. For example, if the EMA or FDA or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of any of our products or product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel, including share-based compensation expenses, in our executive, legal, business development, finance, accounting, information technology and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expense; advertising and promotional expenses; costs associated with industry and trade shows; and professional fees for legal services, including patent-related expenses, accounting services and miscellaneous selling costs.\nWe expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods in connection with our continued efforts to commercialize our products, including increased payroll, expanded infrastructure, commercial operations, increased consulting, legal, accounting and investor relations expenses.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest income earned on investments and interest expense from the Convertible Notes outstanding and interest expense from the Credit Agreement.\nCritical accounting policies\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOf our policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and complex judgment, involving critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements:\n\u2022Revenue recognition\n\u2022Convertible notes offering\n\u2022Income taxes\n\u2022Business combinations and asset acquisitions\n\u2022Indefinite-lived intangible assets\nRevenue recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d. ASU No. 2014-9 eliminated transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Subtopic 605-15, Revenue Recognition-Products (Topic 605) and replaced it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASC Topic 606 requires\nentities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606 using the modified retrospective approach, a practical expedient permitted under Topic 606, and applied this approach only to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. We calculated a one-time transition adjustment of $3.3 million, which was recorded on January 1, 2018 to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, related to the product sales of Emflaza. The ASC 606 transition adjustment recorded for Emflaza resulted in sales being recognized earlier than under Topic 605, as the deferred revenue recognition model (sell-through) is not allowed under Topic 606. The one-time adjustment consisted of $3.9 million in deferred revenue offset by $0.6 million of variable consideration. The information presented for the periods prior to January 1, 2018 has not been adjusted and is reported under Topic 605.\nPeriods prior to January 1, 2018\nWe recognize revenue when amounts are realized or realizable and earned. Revenue is considered realizable and earned when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection of the amounts due are reasonably assured.\nNet product sales\nPrior to the second quarter of 2017, our net product sales have consisted primarily of sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the U.S. We recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Subtopic 605-15, Revenue Recognition-Products.\nWe have recorded revenue on sales where Translarna is available either on a commercial basis or through a reimbursed EAP program. Orders for Translarna are generally received from hospital and retail pharmacies and our third-party partner distributors. Our third-party distributors act as intermediaries between us and end users and do not typically stock significant quantities of Translarna. The ultimate payor for Translarna is typically a government authority or institution or a third-party health insurer.\nIn May 2017, we began the commercialization of Emflaza in the U.S. We recorded product revenue related to the sales of Emflaza in the U.S. in accordance with ASC 605-15, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title of the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer has been reasonably assured. Due to the early stage of the product launch, we determined that we were not able to reliably make certain estimates, including returns, necessary to recognize product revenue upon shipment to distributors. As a result, we recorded net product revenue for Emflaza using a deferred revenue recognition model (sell-through). Under the deferred revenue model, we did not recognize revenue until Emflaza was shipped to the specialty pharmacy. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we evaluated and determined that we had sufficient volume of historical activity and visibility into the distribution channel to reasonably make all estimates required under ASC 605 to recognize revenue upon shipment to its specialty pharmacy. The change from the sell-through model to recognizing revenue upon shipment to specialty pharmacies during the fourth quarter of 2017 was immaterial to the financial statements.\nWe record revenue net of estimated third-party discounts and rebates. Allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time revenues from product sales are recognized. Allowances for government and other third-party rebates and discounts are established or estimated at the time of delivery. These allowances are adjusted to reflect known changes in factors and may impact such allowances in the quarter those changes are known. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized Translarna net sales of $145.2 million and Emflaza net sales of $28.8 million.\nWe expect that net product sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD will fluctuate quarter-over-quarter. In some countries, including those in Latin America, orders for named patient sales or by governmental buyers may be for multiple months of therapy which can lead to an unevenness in orders. In addition, net product sales may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter as a result of government actions, economic pressures and political unrest. Net product sales may be significantly impacted by multiple factors, including, among other things, decisions by regulatory authorities, in particular the FDA, the EMA and ANVISA, with respect to our submissions for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and our ability to successfully negotiate favorable pricing and reimbursement processes on a timely basis in the countries in which we have or may obtain regulatory approval, including the United States, EEA and other territories.\nPeriods commencing January 1, 2018\nOur net product revenue primarily consists of sales of Translarna in territories outside of the U.S. and sales of Emflaza in the U.S., both for the treatment of DMD.\nNet Product Revenue\nWe recognize revenue when performance obligations with customers have been satisfied. Our performance obligations are to provide products based on customer orders from distributors, hospitals, specialty pharmacies or retail pharmacies. The performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time when our customer obtains control of the product, which is typically upon delivery. We invoice customers after the products have been delivered and invoice payments are generally due within 30 to 90 days of invoice date. We determine the transaction price based on fixed consideration in its contractual agreements. Contract liabilities arise in certain circumstances when consideration is due for goods not yet provided. As we have identified only one distinct performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated entirely to the product sale. In determining the transaction price, a significant financing component does not exist since the timing from when we deliver product to when the customers pay for the product is typically less than one year. Customers in certain countries pay in advance of product delivery. In those instances, payment and delivery typically occur in the same month.\nWe record product sales net of any variable consideration, which includes discounts, allowances, rebates related to Medicaid and other government pricing programs, and distribution fees. and distribution fees. We use the expected value or most likely amount method when estimating variable consideration, unless discount or rebate terms are specified within contracts. The identified variable consideration is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time revenues from product sales are recognized. These estimates for variable consideration are adjusted to reflect known changes in factors and may impact such estimates in the quarter those changes are known. Revenue recognized does not include amounts of variable consideration that are constrained. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net product sales outside of the United States were $190.3 million and $171.0 million respectively, and net product sales in the United States were $101.0 million and $92.0 million respectively.\nIn relation to customer contracts, we incur costs to fulfill a contract but do not incur costs to obtain a contract. These costs to fulfill a contract do not meet the criteria for capitalization and are expensed as incurred.\nUpon adoption of ASC Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, we have elected the following practical expedients:\n \u2022 Portfolio Approach - We applied the Portfolio Approach to contract reviews within identified revenue streams that have similar characteristics and we believe this approach would not differ materially than if applying ASC Topic 606 to each individual contract. \n \u2022 Significant Financing Component - We expect the period between when an we transfer a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for the good or service to be one year or less. \n \u2022 Immaterial Performance Obligations - We disregard promises deemed to be immaterial in the context of the contract. \n \u2022 Shipping and Handling Activities - We consider any shipping and handling costs that are incurred after the customer has obtained control of the product as a cost to fulfill a promise.  Shipping and handling costs associated with finished goods delivered to customers are recorded as a selling expense.\nConvertible Notes Offerings\nIn September 2019, we issued $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes, which included an option to purchase up to an additional $37.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes, which was exercised in full by the initial purchasers. The 2026 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 1.50% per year, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. The 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on September 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The net proceeds to us from the offering were $279.3 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.\nThe 2026 Convertible Notes are governed by an indenture, or the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture, with U.S Bank National Association as trustee, or the 2026 Convertible Notes Trustee.\nIn August 2015, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 3.00% per year, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2016. The 2022 Convertible Notes will mature on August 15, 2022, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The net proceeds to us from the offering were $145.4 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes are governed by an indenture, or the 2022 Convertible Notes Indenture, with U.S Bank National Association as trustee, or the 2022 Convertible Notes Trustee.\nAs the Convertible Notes contained embedded conversion features, we separated the Convertible Notes into liability and equity components, in accordance with the guidance in ASC 815. The carrying amount for each of the liability components was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying\namount of each of the equity components representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the respective liability component from the par value of the Convertible Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of each of the liability components over its respective carrying amount, referred to as the debt discount, is amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of each of the Convertible Notes in accordance with ASC 835. The equity component is not re-measured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The equity components recorded at each issuance was recorded in additional paid-in capital.\nIn accounting for the transaction costs related to the issuance of each of the Convertible Notes, we allocated the total costs incurred to the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes based on their relative values in accordance with ASC 470. Transaction costs attributable to each of the liability components are amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of each of the Convertible Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component are netted with the equity components in stockholders' equity. Additionally, we initially recorded net deferred tax liabilities in connection with each of the Convertible Notes.\nIncome taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of approximately $267.1 million and $180.5 million, respectively. The change in the valuation allowance during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $86.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively. A valuation allowance has been recorded since, in the judgment of management, these assets are not more likely than not to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences and carryforwards become deductible or are utilized. As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately $433.3 million, $224.4 million, and $8.4 million of federal, state, and ex-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, respectively. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, we no longer exclude tax benefits that arose directly from equity compensation in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting in its U.S. federal and U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards.\nDuring 2018, we acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, as part of the acquisition of Agilis. This asset is currently considered an indefinite-lived intangible with no related book amortization and tested for impairment, annually. As the IPR&D has no tax basis and is an indefinite-lived intangible, the deferred tax liability created at the time of acquisition is not considered positive evidence of future income and is presented as a deferred tax liability in the balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2019, research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes are approximately $14.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively. In addition, the Orphan Drug Credit Carryover available as of December 31, 2019 is approximately $85.2 million. As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation, federal net operating losses, or NOLs, generated in 2018 carryforward indefinitely, however, we have federal net operating losses that pre-date U.S. tax reform legislation which begin to expire in 2021 and federal credit carryforwards that begin to expire in 2019. State net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2030, and the state credit carryforwards began to expire in 2016. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 subject the future utilization of net operating losses and certain other tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, to an annual limitation in the event of certain ownership changes, as defined. We have undergone an ownership change and have determined that a change in ownership\u201d as defined by IRC Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, did occur in June of 2013. Accordingly, about $231.5 million of our NOL carryforwards are limited and we can only use $16.7 million for the first five years from the ownership change and $5.7 million per year going forward. Therefore, $169.2 million of the NOLs will be freed up over the next 20 years and $62.3 million are expected to expire unused which are not included in the deferred tax assets listed above. In summary, including the NOLs expected to expire, there are $495.7 million of NOLs available, out of which $231.5 million are limited by IRC Section 382. At December 31, 2019, there is $333.2 million available for immediate use and an additional $5.7 million will free up in 2020.\nBusiness combinations and asset acquisitions\nWe evaluate acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the screen is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen is not met, further determination is required as to whether or not we have acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs, which would meet the requirements of a business. If determined to be a business combination, we account for the transaction under the acquisition method of accounting as indicated in ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations\u201d, which requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement point. Accordingly, we recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business\ncombinations, including contingent assets and liabilities, and non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on the fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition. In accordance with ASC 805, we recognize and measure goodwill as of the acquisition date, as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired.\nThe consideration for our business acquisitions may include future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event or events. The obligations for such contingent consideration payments are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. The contingent consideration obligations are then evaluated each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, other than changes due to payments, are recognized as a gain or loss and recorded within the change in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIf determined to be an asset acquisition, we account for the transaction under ASC 805-50, which requires the acquiring entity in an asset acquisition to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the cost to the acquiring entity on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to consideration given. No gain or loss is recognized as of the date of acquisition unless the fair value of noncash assets given as consideration differs from the assets' carrying amounts on the acquiring entity's books. Consideration transferred that is noncash will be measured based on either the cost (which shall be measured based on the fair value of the consideration given) or the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever is more reliably measurable. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition and any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to the identifiable assets based on relative fair values.\nContingent consideration payments in asset acquisitions are recognized when the contingency is resolved and the consideration is paid or becomes payable (unless the contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative, in which case the amount becomes part of the basis in the asset acquired). Upon recognition of the contingent consideration payment, the amount is included in the cost of the acquired asset or group of assets.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of IPR&D. IPR&D acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination is capitalized if the projects will be further developed or have an alternative future use; otherwise they are expensed. The fair values of IPR&D projects acquired in business combinations are capitalized. Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of the IPR&D acquired in a business combination. We utilize the \"income method\u201d, and use estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These projections are based on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection, and expected pricing and industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. These assets are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the projects, at which time the assets are amortized over the remaining useful life or written off, as appropriate. Intangible assets with indefinite lives, including IPR&D, are tested for impairment if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum, annually. However, an entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if the entity determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. Otherwise, no further impairment testing is required. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test consists of a one-step analysis that compares the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We consider many factors in evaluating whether the value of its intangible assets with indefinite lives may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to, expected growth rates, the cost of equity and debt capital, general economic conditions, our outlook and market performance of our industry and recent and forecasted financial performance. We performed our annual test for its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2019 and concluded that no impairment exists as of December 31, 2019.\nFor a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table summarizes revenues and selected expense and other income data for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: \nNet product revenue. Net product revenue was $291.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $28.3 million, or 11%, from net product revenue of $263.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net product revenue was primarily due to the increase in net product sales in existing markets where Translarna is available as well as continued geographic expansion into new territories, in addition to an increase in net product sales of Emflaza.\nCollaboration and grant revenue. Collaboration and grant revenue was $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $13.9 million, over 100%, from collaboration and grant revenue of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in collaboration and grant revenue was primarily due to the $15.0 million milestone achieved during the fourth quarter of 2019 from Roche, which was triggered in November 2019 upon the FDA's acceptance of the filing of the NDA for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA.\nCost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset. Cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset, was $12.1 million for the year end December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 4%, from $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of product sales consist primarily of royalty payments associated with Emflaza and Translarna net product sales, excluding contingent payments to Marathon Pharmaceuticals, LLC (now known as Complete Pharma Holdings, LLC), or Marathon, and costs associated with product sold during the period. The decrease year over year is primarily due to a $1.8 million inventory write down for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to inventory labeling changes.\nAmortization of acquired intangible asset. Amortization of acquired intangible asset was $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $4.8 million, or 21%, from $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. These amounts are related to the acquisition of all rights to Emflaza acquired in May 2017, Marathon contingent payments, and our Waylivra and Tegsedi intangible assets. The increase is primarily related to additional Marathon contingent payments. The amount allocated to the Emflaza intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of approximately seven years from the date of the completion of the acquisition of all rights to Emflaza, the period of estimated future cash flows. The Marathon contingent payments are amortized prospectively as incurred, straight-line, over the remaining useful life of the Emflaza intangible asset. The Waylivra and Tegsedi assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of approximately ten years, respectively.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense was $257.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $85.5 million, or 50%, compared to $172.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase reflects costs associated with advancing the gene therapy platform and increased investment in research programs, such as our acquisition of PTC743 from BioElectron, which represents $10.1 million of the increase, as well as advancement of the clinical pipeline.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense was $202.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $49.0 million, or 32%, from $153.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The\nincrease was primarily due to continued investment to support our commercial activities including our expanding commercial portfolio.\nChange in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration. Change in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration was $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $29.0 million, or 150%, from $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change is related to the fair valuation of the potential future consideration to be paid to former equity holders of Agilis, as a result of our merger with Agilis which closed in August 2018. Changes in the fair value were due to the re-calculation of discounted cash flows for the passage of time and changes to certain other estimated assumptions.\nInterest expense, net. Net interest expense was $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1%, from net interest expense of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to increased interest income from investments, which partially offset current year interest expense recorded from the 2022 and 2026 Convertible Notes and the Credit Agreement.\nOther income, net. Other income, net was $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $13.6 million, over 100%, from other income, net of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in other income, net resulted primarily from a foreign exchange gain from the remeasurement of our intercompany loan and an unrealized gain on our equity investment in ClearPoint Neuro, Inc. (formerly MRI Interventions, Inc.), or our Equity Investment, of $2.2 million, partially offset by exchange rate changes in the current period.\nIncome tax (expense) benefit. Income tax expense was $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a change of $11.7 million, over 100%, from income tax benefit of $0.03 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We incurred income tax expense in various ex-U.S. jurisdictions, and our ex-U.S. tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of pre-tax earnings among these different jurisdictions. We are paying minimum income taxes in the United States because of incurred losses in the various state jurisdictions.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table summarizes revenues and selected expense and other income data for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nNet product revenue. Net product revenue was $263.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $88.9 million, or 51%, from net product revenue of $174.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net product revenue was primarily due to the increase in net product sales of $25.8 million in existing markets where Translarna is available as well as continued geographic expansion into new territories, in addition to an increase in $63.2 million in net product sales of Emflaza, which launched domestically in May 2017.\nCollaboration and grant revenue. Collaboration and grant revenue was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $18.6 million, or 91%, from collaboration and grant revenue of $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in collaboration and grant revenue was primarily due to the $20.0 million milestone achieved during the fourth quarter of 2017 from Roche. In October 2017, we announced that Sunfish, a two-part clinical trial in pediatric and adult type 2 and type 3 spinal muscular atrophy initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016, had transitioned into the pivotal second part of its study which triggered the milestone payment.\nCost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset. Cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset, was $12.7 million for the year end December 31, 2018, an increase of $8.1 million, or 177%, from $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of product sales consist primarily of royalty payments associated with Emflaza and Translarna net product sales and costs associated with Emflaza and Translarna product sold during the period. For Translarna sold in 2017, the majority of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed prior to January 1, 2017 as research and development expenses.\nAmortization of acquired intangible asset. Amortization of acquired", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nWe are a science-driven global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically-differentiated medicines that provide benefits to patients with rare disorders. Our ability to commercialize products is the foundation that drives our continued investment in a robust diversified pipeline of transformative medicines and our mission to provide access to best-in-class treatments for patients who have an unmet medical need. Our strategy is to bring best-in-class therapies with differentiated clinical benefit to patients affected by rare disorders and to leverage our global commercial infrastructure to maximize value for our patients and other stakeholders. We have a portfolio pipeline that includes commercial products as well as product candidates in various stages of development, including clinical, pre-clinical and research and discovery stages, focused on the development of new treatments for multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases and oncology.\nWe have two products, Translarna\u2122 (ataluren) and Emflaza\u2122 (deflazacort), for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, a rare, life threatening disorder. Translarna has marketing authorization in the European Economic Area, or EEA, for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or nmDMD, in ambulatory patients aged two years and older and in Brazil for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $190.0 million in sales of Translarna. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to Translarna for all indications in all territories. Emflaza is approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD in patients two years and older. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Emflaza achieved net sales of $101.0 million.\nOur marketing authorization for Translarna in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment. In July 2019, the European Commission renewed our marketing authorization, making it effective, unless extended, through August 5, 2020. In February 2020, we submitted a marketing authorization renewal request to the EMA. This marketing authorization is further subject to a specific obligation to conduct and submit the results of a18-month, placebo-controlled trial, followed by an 18-month open-label extension, which we refer to together as Study 041. The final report on the trial and open-label extension is to be submitted by us to the EMA by the end of the third quarter of 2022.\nEach country, including each member state of the EEA, has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations. In order to commence commercial sale of product pursuant to our Translarna marketing authorization in any particular country in the EEA, we must finalize pricing and reimbursement negotiations with the applicable government body in such country. As a result, our commercial launch will continue to be on a country-by-country basis. We also have made, and expect to continue to make, product available under early access programs, or EAP programs, both in countries in the EEA and other territories. Our ability to negotiate, secure and maintain reimbursement for product under commercial and EAP programs can be subject to challenge in any particular country and can also be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments in such country.\nThere is substantial risk that if we are unable to renew our EEA marketing authorization during any annual renewal cycle, or if our product label is materially restricted, or if Study 041 does not provide the data necessary to maintain our marketing authorization, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna in the EEA and other territories.\nTranslarna is an investigational new drug in the United States. During the first quarter of 2017, we filed a New Drug Application, or NDA, for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD over protest with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In October 2017, the Office of Drug Evaluation I of the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the NDA, stating that it was unable to approve the application in its current form. In response, we filed a formal dispute resolution request with the Office of New Drugs of the FDA. In February 2018, the Office of New Drugs of the FDA denied our appeal of the Complete Response Letter. In its response, the Office of New Drugs recommended a possible path forward for the ataluren NDA submission based on the accelerated approval pathway. This would involve a re-submission of an NDA containing the current data on effectiveness of ataluren with new data to be generated on dystrophin production in nmDMD patients' muscles. We intend to follow the FDA's recommendation and will collect, using newer technologies via procedures and methods that we designed, such dystrophin data in a new study, Study 045, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect that a potential re-submission of an NDA could occur in mid-year 2020. Additionally, should a re-submission of an NDA receive accelerated approval, the Office of New Drugs stated that Study 041, which is currently enrolling, could serve as the confirmatory post-approval trial required in connection with the accelerated approval framework.\nThere is substantial risk that Study 045, or any other studies we may use to collect the dystrophin data, will not provide the necessary data to support a marketing approval for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the U.S.\nWe hold the rights for the commercialization of Tegsedi\u2122 (inotersen) and Waylivra\u2122 (volanesorsen) for the treatment of rare diseases in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean pursuant to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Akcea Therapeutics, Inc., or Akcea. Tegsedi has received marketing authorization in the United States, EU and Brazil for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis. Waylivra has received marketing authorization in the European Union, or EU, for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS. We anticipate filing for marketing authorization with ANVISA in the second half of 2020.\nWe have a pipeline of gene therapy product candidates for rare monogenic diseases that affect the central nervous system, or CNS, including PTC-AADC for the treatment of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase, or AADC, deficiency, or AADC deficiency, a rare CNS disorder arising from reductions in the enzyme AADC that result from mutations in the dopa decarboxylase gene. We are preparing a biologics license application, or BLA, for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States, which we anticipate submitting to the FDA in the second quarter of 2020. In January 2020, we submitted a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the EEA to the EMA and we expect an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, by the end of 2020.\nWe also have a spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, collaboration with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffman-La Roche Inc., which we refer to collectively as Roche, and the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation, or SMA Foundation. The lead compound in the SMA program is risdiplam (RG7916, RO7034067). Roche submitted an NDA for risdiplam to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date for a decision by the FDA is May 24, 2020. Risdiplam is expected to be indicated in the United States for SMA type 1, 2 and 3 patients, if approved. Roche anticipates submitting an MAA for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA in the EEA in mid-year 2020.\nIn 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of BioElectron Technology Corporation, or BioElectron, including certain compounds that we have begun to develop as part of our Bio-e platform. In 2020, we plan to initiate three trials in this platform with two unique compounds that regulate inflammation and oxidative stress.\nIn addition, we have a pipeline of product candidates and discovery programs that are in early clinical, pre-clinical and research and development stages focused on the development of new treatments for multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases and oncology.\nOverview-Funding\nThe success of our products and any other product candidates we may develop, depends largely on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement from governments and third-party insurers. During 2019, our revenues were generated from sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in countries where we were able to obtain acceptable commercial pricing and reimbursement terms and in select countries where we are permitted to distribute Translarna under our EAP programs, and from sales of Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States.\nSee Item 1. Business-Commercial Matters-Market Access Considerations\u201d for additional information and Item 1A. Risk Factors-Commercialization of Translarna has been in, and is expected to continue to take place in, countries that tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues. Failure to obtain and maintain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and other countries where Translarna is available would delay or prevent us from marketing our product in such regions, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\u201d\nOn April 20, 2017, we completed our acquisition of all rights to Emflaza, or the Transaction, for total upfront consideration comprised of $75.0 million in cash, funded through cash on hand, and 6,683,598 shares of our common stock, which was determined by dividing $65.0 million by the volume weighted average price per share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq for the 15 trading-day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the closing.\nOn May 5, 2017, we entered into a credit and security agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with MidCap Financial Trust, or MidCap Financial, as administrative agent and MidCap Financial and other certain institutions as lenders thereto, that provides for a senior secured term loan facility of $60 million, of which $40 million was drawn by us on May 5, 2017. Our ability to draw on the remaining $20.0 million under the senior secured term loan facility expired on December 31, 2018. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is May 1, 2021, unless terminated earlier.\nIn April 2018, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. We issued and sold an aggregate of 4,600,000 shares of common stock under the registration statement at a public offering price of $27.04 per share, including 600,000 shares issued upon exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase\nadditional shares. We received net proceeds of approximately $117.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nOn August 23, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Agilis Biotherapeutics, Inc., or Agilis, for total upfront consideration comprised of $49.2 million in cash and 3,500,907 shares of our common stock, which was determined by dividing $150.0 million by the volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock on Nasdaq for the 10 consecutive trading-day period ending on the second trading-day immediately preceding the closing.\nIn January 2019, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. We issued and sold an aggregate of 7,563,725 shares of common stock under the registration statement at a public offering price of $30.20 per share, including 843,725 shares issued upon exercise by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional shares in February 2019. We received net proceeds of approximately $224.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn August 2019, we entered into an At the Market Offering Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, or together, the Sales Agents, pursuant to which, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $125.0 million from time to time through the Sales Agents by any method that is deemed to be an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued and sold an aggregate of 63,926 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement at a weighted average public offering price of $46.60 per share. We received net proceeds of $2.6 million after deducting agent discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn September 2019, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. We issued and sold an aggregate of 2,475,248 shares of common stock under the registration statement at a public offering price of $40.40 per share. The offering included an option to purchase up to an additional 371,287 shares for a period of 30 days following the offering. This option was not exercised by the underwriter. We received net proceeds of $97.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn September 2019, we issued $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due September 15, 2026, or the 2026 Convertible Notes, which included an option to purchase up to an additional $37.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes, which was exercised in full by the initial purchasers. The 2026 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 1.50% per year, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. The 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on September 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. We received net proceeds of $279.3 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.\nOn October 25, 2019, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of BioElectron for total upfront consideration of $10.0 million in cash less (i) transaction expenses incurred by BioElectron, (ii) the amount of outstanding indebtedness of BioElectron including a $4.0 million loan advance to BioElectron plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (iii) $1.5 million held in an escrow account to secure potential indemnification obligations owed to us.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through our offering of 3.00% convertible senior notes due August 15, 2022, or the 2022 Convertible Notes offering, our offering of 1.50% convertible senior notes due September 15, 2026, or the 2026 Convertible Notes, and, together with the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes, our public offerings of common stock in February 2014, in October 2014, in April 2018, in January 2019, and in September 2019, the common stock issued in our at the marketing offering\u201d, our initial public offering of common stock in June 2013, private placements of our preferred stock, collaborations, bank debt and convertible debt financings, the Credit Agreement and grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates. Since 2014, we have also relied on revenue generated from net sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States, and since May 2017, we have generated revenue from net sales of Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,190.5 million. We had a net loss of $251.6 million and $128.1 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe anticipate that our expenses will continue to increase in connection with our commercialization efforts in the United States, the EEA, Latin America and other territories, including the expansion of our infrastructure and corresponding sales and marketing, legal and regulatory, distribution and manufacturing, including expanding our direct manufacturing capabilities at our new biologics manufacturing facility and administrative and employee-based expenses. In addition to the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur ongoing research and development expenses for our products and product candidates, including our gene therapy, splicing, Bio-e and oncology programs as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, including Study\n041, label extensions and additional indications. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in connection with our efforts to advance our regulatory submissions. We continue to seek marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories that we do not currently have marketing authorization in and we may also seek marketing authorization for Translarna for other indications. We submitted an MAA to the EMA for the treatment of AADC deficiency with PTC-AADC in the EEA and we are preparing a BLA for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States, which we anticipate submitting to the FDA in the second quarter of 2020. We also anticipate filing for marketing authorization for Waylivra with ANVISA in the second half of 2020. These efforts may significantly impact the timing and extent of our commercialization expenses.\nWe may seek to expand and diversify our product pipeline through opportunistically in-licensing or acquiring the rights to products, product candidates or technologies and we may incur expenses, including with respect to transaction costs, subsequent development costs or any upfront, milestone or other payments or other financial obligations associated with any such transaction, which would increase our future capital requirements.\nWith respect to our outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes, cash interest payments are payable on a semi-annual basis in arrears, which require total funding of $4.5 million annually. With respect to our outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes, cash interest payments are payable on a semi-annual basis in arrears, which will require total funding of $4.3 million annually. Additionally, under the terms of our Credit Agreement cash interest payments are payable monthly in arrears. We are also required to pay $40.0 million in development milestone payments upon the passing of the second anniversary of the closing of the Agilis acquisition, August 23, 2020, regardless of whether the applicable milestones have been achieved. In addition, Akcea is eligible to receive from us an additional milestone payment of $4.0 million upon receipt of regulatory approval for Waylivra from ANVISA. Furthermore, since we are a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as such including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. See also, The price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock and lawsuits against us and our officers and directors\u201d under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Common Stock.\nWe will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and sustain profitability, and we may never do so. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nFinancial operations overview\nTo date, our net product revenues have consisted primarily of sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States and sales of Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States. Our process for recognizing revenue is described below under Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates-Revenue recognition\u201d.\nRoche and the SMA Foundation Collaboration. In November 2011, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or licensing agreement, with Roche and the SMA Foundation pursuant to which we are collaborating with Roche and the SMA Foundation to further develop and commercialize compounds identified under our spinal muscular atrophy program with the SMA Foundation. The research component of this agreement terminated effective December 31, 2014. The licensing agreement included a $30 million upfront payment made in 2011 which was recognized on a deferred basis over the research term, and the potential for up to $460 million in milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\nIn August 2013, we announced the selection of a development candidate, RG7800. The achievement of this milestone triggered a $10.0 million payment to us from Roche, which we recorded as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIn January 2014, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical program for RG7800, which triggered a $7.5 million milestone payment to us from Roche which we recorded as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn November 2014, we announced that our joint development program in SMA with Roche and the SMA Foundation, or SMAF has started a Phase 2 study for RG7800 in adult and pediatric patients. The achievement of this milestone triggered a $10.0 million payment to us from Roche which we recorded as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn October 2017, we announced that the joint development program in SMA with Roche and SMAF had transitioned into the pivotal second part of its study evaluating the efficacy and safety of RG7916 in pediatric and adult Type 2/3 SMA patients. The achievement of this milestone triggered a $20.0 million payment to us from Roche which we recorded as collaboration revenue at time of achievement.\nIn November 2019, we announced that the FDA accepted the filing of and granted priority review for the NDA for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA. The filing acceptance by the FDA triggered a $15.0 million payment to us from Roche which we recorded as collaboration revenue at time of achievement.\nThe remaining potential research and development event milestones that can be received as of December 31, 2019 is $72.5 million. The remaining potential sales milestones as of December 31, 2019 is $325.0 million upon achievement of certain sales events. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive up to double digit royalties on worldwide annual net sales of a commercial product.\nGrant revenue. From time to time, we receive grant funding from various institutions and governmental bodies. The grants are typically for early discovery research, and generally such grant programs last from two to five years.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expenses consist of the costs associated with our research activities, as well as the costs associated with our drug discovery efforts, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings. Our research and development expenses consist of:\n \u2022 external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third-party contract research organizations and investigative sites, third-party manufacturing organizations and consultants; \n \u2022 employee-related expenses, which include salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation, for the personnel involved in our drug discovery and development activities; and \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment, and laboratory and other supplies.  We use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects, including our drug development programs. We track expenses related to our clinical programs and certain preclinical programs on a per project basis.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to fluctuate in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly in connection with Study 041 and other studies for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, our activities under our gene therapy, splicing, Bio-e and oncology programs, our studies of Translarna for additional indications, and performance of our FDA post-marketing requirements with respect to Emflaza in the United States. The timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the outcome of our ongoing clinical trials and the costs associated with our planned clinical trials. The timing and amount of these expenses will also depend on the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our products or product candidates and the related expansion of our research and development organization, regulatory requirements, advancement of our preclinical programs, and product and product candidate manufacturing costs.\nThe following table provides research and development expense for our most advanced principal product development programs, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 358: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Translarna (nmDMD, aniridia and Dravet)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bio-e\n</td> <td>10,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gene therapy\n</td> <td>62,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oncology\n</td> <td>21,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Next generation nonsense readthrough\n</td> <td>4,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Emflaza\n</td> <td>22,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Akcea\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other research and preclinical\n</td> <td>42,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe successful development of our product and product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities; \n \u2022 the potential benefits of our product and product candidates over other therapies; \n \u2022 our ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for our product or any of our product candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future, including our ability to negotiate pricing and reimbursement terms acceptable to us; \n \u2022 clinical trial results; \n \u2022 the terms and timing of regulatory approvals; and \n \u2022 the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights.  A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our products or product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidates. For example, if the EMA or FDA or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of any of our products or product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel, including share-based compensation expenses, in our executive, legal, business development, finance, accounting, information technology and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expense; advertising and promotional expenses; costs associated with industry and trade shows; and professional fees for legal services, including patent-related expenses, accounting services and miscellaneous selling costs.\nWe expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods in connection with our continued efforts to commercialize our products, including increased payroll, expanded infrastructure, commercial operations, increased consulting, legal, accounting and investor relations expenses.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest income earned on investments and interest expense from the Convertible Notes outstanding and interest expense from the Credit Agreement.\nCritical accounting policies\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOf our policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and complex judgment, involving critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements:\n\u2022Revenue recognition\n\u2022Convertible notes offering\n\u2022Income taxes\n\u2022Business combinations and asset acquisitions\n\u2022Indefinite-lived intangible assets\nRevenue recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d. ASU No. 2014-9 eliminated transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Subtopic 605-15, Revenue Recognition-Products (Topic 605) and replaced it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASC Topic 606 requires\nentities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606 using the modified retrospective approach, a practical expedient permitted under Topic 606, and applied this approach only to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. We calculated a one-time transition adjustment of $3.3 million, which was recorded on January 1, 2018 to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, related to the product sales of Emflaza. The ASC 606 transition adjustment recorded for Emflaza resulted in sales being recognized earlier than under Topic 605, as the deferred revenue recognition model (sell-through) is not allowed under Topic 606. The one-time adjustment consisted of $3.9 million in deferred revenue offset by $0.6 million of variable consideration. The information presented for the periods prior to January 1, 2018 has not been adjusted and is reported under Topic 605.\nPeriods prior to January 1, 2018\nWe recognize revenue when amounts are realized or realizable and earned. Revenue is considered realizable and earned when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection of the amounts due are reasonably assured.\nNet product sales\nPrior to the second quarter of 2017, our net product sales have consisted primarily of sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the U.S. We recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Subtopic 605-15, Revenue Recognition-Products.\nWe have recorded revenue on sales where Translarna is available either on a commercial basis or through a reimbursed EAP program. Orders for Translarna are generally received from hospital and retail pharmacies and our third-party partner distributors. Our third-party distributors act as intermediaries between us and end users and do not typically stock significant quantities of Translarna. The ultimate payor for Translarna is typically a government authority or institution or a third-party health insurer.\nIn May 2017, we began the commercialization of Emflaza in the U.S. We recorded product revenue related to the sales of Emflaza in the U.S. in accordance with ASC 605-15, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title of the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer has been reasonably assured. Due to the early stage of the product launch, we determined that we were not able to reliably make certain estimates, including returns, necessary to recognize product revenue upon shipment to distributors. As a result, we recorded net product revenue for Emflaza using a deferred revenue recognition model (sell-through). Under the deferred revenue model, we did not recognize revenue until Emflaza was shipped to the specialty pharmacy. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we evaluated and determined that we had sufficient volume of historical activity and visibility into the distribution channel to reasonably make all estimates required under ASC 605 to recognize revenue upon shipment to its specialty pharmacy. The change from the sell-through model to recognizing revenue upon shipment to specialty pharmacies during the fourth quarter of 2017 was immaterial to the financial statements.\nWe record revenue net of estimated third-party discounts and rebates. Allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time revenues from product sales are recognized. Allowances for government and other third-party rebates and discounts are established or estimated at the time of delivery. These allowances are adjusted to reflect known changes in factors and may impact such allowances in the quarter those changes are known. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized Translarna net sales of $145.2 million and Emflaza net sales of $28.8 million.\nWe expect that net product sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD will fluctuate quarter-over-quarter. In some countries, including those in Latin America, orders for named patient sales or by governmental buyers may be for multiple months of therapy which can lead to an unevenness in orders. In addition, net product sales may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter as a result of government actions, economic pressures and political unrest. Net product sales may be significantly impacted by multiple factors, including, among other things, decisions by regulatory authorities, in particular the FDA, the EMA and ANVISA, with respect to our submissions for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and our ability to successfully negotiate favorable pricing and reimbursement processes on a timely basis in the countries in which we have or may obtain regulatory approval, including the United States, EEA and other territories.\nPeriods commencing January 1, 2018\nOur net product revenue primarily consists of sales of Translarna in territories outside of the U.S. and sales of Emflaza in the U.S., both for the treatment of DMD.\nNet Product Revenue\nWe recognize revenue when performance obligations with customers have been satisfied. Our performance obligations are to provide products based on customer orders from distributors, hospitals, specialty pharmacies or retail pharmacies. The performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time when our customer obtains control of the product, which is typically upon delivery. We invoice customers after the products have been delivered and invoice payments are generally due within 30 to 90 days of invoice date. We determine the transaction price based on fixed consideration in its contractual agreements. Contract liabilities arise in certain circumstances when consideration is due for goods not yet provided. As we have identified only one distinct performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated entirely to the product sale. In determining the transaction price, a significant financing component does not exist since the timing from when we deliver product to when the customers pay for the product is typically less than one year. Customers in certain countries pay in advance of product delivery. In those instances, payment and delivery typically occur in the same month.\nWe record product sales net of any variable consideration, which includes discounts, allowances, rebates related to Medicaid and other government pricing programs, and distribution fees. and distribution fees. We use the expected value or most likely amount method when estimating variable consideration, unless discount or rebate terms are specified within contracts. The identified variable consideration is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time revenues from product sales are recognized. These estimates for variable consideration are adjusted to reflect known changes in factors and may impact such estimates in the quarter those changes are known. Revenue recognized does not include amounts of variable consideration that are constrained. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net product sales outside of the United States were $190.3 million and $171.0 million respectively, and net product sales in the United States were $101.0 million and $92.0 million respectively.\nIn relation to customer contracts, we incur costs to fulfill a contract but do not incur costs to obtain a contract. These costs to fulfill a contract do not meet the criteria for capitalization and are expensed as incurred.\nUpon adoption of ASC Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, we have elected the following practical expedients:\n \u2022 Portfolio Approach - We applied the Portfolio Approach to contract reviews within identified revenue streams that have similar characteristics and we believe this approach would not differ materially than if applying ASC Topic 606 to each individual contract. \n \u2022 Significant Financing Component - We expect the period between when an we transfer a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for the good or service to be one year or less. \n \u2022 Immaterial Performance Obligations - We disregard promises deemed to be immaterial in the context of the contract. \n \u2022 Shipping and Handling Activities - We consider any shipping and handling costs that are incurred after the customer has obtained control of the product as a cost to fulfill a promise.  Shipping and handling costs associated with finished goods delivered to customers are recorded as a selling expense.\nConvertible Notes Offerings\nIn September 2019, we issued $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes, which included an option to purchase up to an additional $37.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes, which was exercised in full by the initial purchasers. The 2026 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 1.50% per year, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. The 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on September 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The net proceeds to us from the offering were $279.3 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.\nThe 2026 Convertible Notes are governed by an indenture, or the 2026 Convertible Notes Indenture, with U.S Bank National Association as trustee, or the 2026 Convertible Notes Trustee.\nIn August 2015, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 3.00% per year, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2016. The 2022 Convertible Notes will mature on August 15, 2022, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The net proceeds to us from the offering were $145.4 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes are governed by an indenture, or the 2022 Convertible Notes Indenture, with U.S Bank National Association as trustee, or the 2022 Convertible Notes Trustee.\nAs the Convertible Notes contained embedded conversion features, we separated the Convertible Notes into liability and equity components, in accordance with the guidance in ASC 815. The carrying amount for each of the liability components was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying\namount of each of the equity components representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the respective liability component from the par value of the Convertible Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of each of the liability components over its respective carrying amount, referred to as the debt discount, is amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of each of the Convertible Notes in accordance with ASC 835. The equity component is not re-measured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The equity components recorded at each issuance was recorded in additional paid-in capital.\nIn accounting for the transaction costs related to the issuance of each of the Convertible Notes, we allocated the total costs incurred to the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes based on their relative values in accordance with ASC 470. Transaction costs attributable to each of the liability components are amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of each of the Convertible Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component are netted with the equity components in stockholders' equity. Additionally, we initially recorded net deferred tax liabilities in connection with each of the Convertible Notes.\nIncome taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of approximately $267.1 million and $180.5 million, respectively. The change in the valuation allowance during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $86.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively. A valuation allowance has been recorded since, in the judgment of management, these assets are not more likely than not to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences and carryforwards become deductible or are utilized. As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately $433.3 million, $224.4 million, and $8.4 million of federal, state, and ex-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, respectively. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, we no longer exclude tax benefits that arose directly from equity compensation in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting in its U.S. federal and U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards.\nDuring 2018, we acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, as part of the acquisition of Agilis. This asset is currently considered an indefinite-lived intangible with no related book amortization and tested for impairment, annually. As the IPR&D has no tax basis and is an indefinite-lived intangible, the deferred tax liability created at the time of acquisition is not considered positive evidence of future income and is presented as a deferred tax liability in the balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2019, research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes are approximately $14.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively. In addition, the Orphan Drug Credit Carryover available as of December 31, 2019 is approximately $85.2 million. As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation, federal net operating losses, or NOLs, generated in 2018 carryforward indefinitely, however, we have federal net operating losses that pre-date U.S. tax reform legislation which begin to expire in 2021 and federal credit carryforwards that begin to expire in 2019. State net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2030, and the state credit carryforwards began to expire in 2016. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 subject the future utilization of net operating losses and certain other tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, to an annual limitation in the event of certain ownership changes, as defined. We have undergone an ownership change and have determined that a change in ownership\u201d as defined by IRC Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, did occur in June of 2013. Accordingly, about $231.5 million of our NOL carryforwards are limited and we can only use $16.7 million for the first five years from the ownership change and $5.7 million per year going forward. Therefore, $169.2 million of the NOLs will be freed up over the next 20 years and $62.3 million are expected to expire unused which are not included in the deferred tax assets listed above. In summary, including the NOLs expected to expire, there are $495.7 million of NOLs available, out of which $231.5 million are limited by IRC Section 382. At December 31, 2019, there is $333.2 million available for immediate use and an additional $5.7 million will free up in 2020.\nBusiness combinations and asset acquisitions\nWe evaluate acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the screen is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen is not met, further determination is required as to whether or not we have acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs, which would meet the requirements of a business. If determined to be a business combination, we account for the transaction under the acquisition method of accounting as indicated in ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations\u201d, which requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement point. Accordingly, we recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business\ncombinations, including contingent assets and liabilities, and non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on the fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition. In accordance with ASC 805, we recognize and measure goodwill as of the acquisition date, as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired.\nThe consideration for our business acquisitions may include future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event or events. The obligations for such contingent consideration payments are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. The contingent consideration obligations are then evaluated each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, other than changes due to payments, are recognized as a gain or loss and recorded within the change in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIf determined to be an asset acquisition, we account for the transaction under ASC 805-50, which requires the acquiring entity in an asset acquisition to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the cost to the acquiring entity on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to consideration given. No gain or loss is recognized as of the date of acquisition unless the fair value of noncash assets given as consideration differs from the assets' carrying amounts on the acquiring entity's books. Consideration transferred that is noncash will be measured based on either the cost (which shall be measured based on the fair value of the consideration given) or the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever is more reliably measurable. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition and any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to the identifiable assets based on relative fair values.\nContingent consideration payments in asset acquisitions are recognized when the contingency is resolved and the consideration is paid or becomes payable (unless the contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative, in which case the amount becomes part of the basis in the asset acquired). Upon recognition of the contingent consideration payment, the amount is included in the cost of the acquired asset or group of assets.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of IPR&D. IPR&D acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination is capitalized if the projects will be further developed or have an alternative future use; otherwise they are expensed. The fair values of IPR&D projects acquired in business combinations are capitalized. Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of the IPR&D acquired in a business combination. We utilize the \"income method\u201d, and use estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These projections are based on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection, and expected pricing and industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. These assets are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the projects, at which time the assets are amortized over the remaining useful life or written off, as appropriate. Intangible assets with indefinite lives, including IPR&D, are tested for impairment if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum, annually. However, an entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if the entity determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. Otherwise, no further impairment testing is required. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test consists of a one-step analysis that compares the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We consider many factors in evaluating whether the value of its intangible assets with indefinite lives may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to, expected growth rates, the cost of equity and debt capital, general economic conditions, our outlook and market performance of our industry and recent and forecasted financial performance. We performed our annual test for its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2019 and concluded that no impairment exists as of December 31, 2019.\nFor a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table summarizes revenues and selected expense and other income data for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Table 369: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n2019 vs. 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net product revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration and grant revenue\n</td> <td>15,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset\n</td> <td>12,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(535\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangible asset\n</td> <td>27,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expense\n</td> <td>257,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>202,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration\n</td> <td>48,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(12,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>13,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>(11,650\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,679\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet product revenue. Net product revenue was $291.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $28.3 million, or 11%, from net product revenue of $263.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net product revenue was primarily due to the increase in net product sales in existing markets where Translarna is available as well as continued geographic expansion into new territories, in addition to an increase in net product sales of Emflaza.\nCollaboration and grant revenue. Collaboration and grant revenue was $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $13.9 million, over 100%, from collaboration and grant revenue of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in collaboration and grant revenue was primarily due to the $15.0 million milestone achieved during the fourth quarter of 2019 from Roche, which was triggered in November 2019 upon the FDA's acceptance of the filing of the NDA for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA.\nCost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset. Cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset, was $12.1 million for the year end December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 4%, from $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of product sales consist primarily of royalty payments associated with Emflaza and Translarna net product sales, excluding contingent payments to Marathon Pharmaceuticals, LLC (now known as Complete Pharma Holdings, LLC), or Marathon, and costs associated with product sold during the period. The decrease year over year is primarily due to a $1.8 million inventory write down for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to inventory labeling changes.\nAmortization of acquired intangible asset. Amortization of acquired intangible asset was $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $4.8 million, or 21%, from $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. These amounts are related to the acquisition of all rights to Emflaza acquired in May 2017, Marathon contingent payments, and our Waylivra and Tegsedi intangible assets. The increase is primarily related to additional Marathon contingent payments. The amount allocated to the Emflaza intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of approximately seven years from the date of the completion of the acquisition of all rights to Emflaza, the period of estimated future cash flows. The Marathon contingent payments are amortized prospectively as incurred, straight-line, over the remaining useful life of the Emflaza intangible asset. The Waylivra and Tegsedi assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of approximately ten years, respectively.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense was $257.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $85.5 million, or 50%, compared to $172.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase reflects costs associated with advancing the gene therapy platform and increased investment in research programs, such as our acquisition of PTC743 from BioElectron, which represents $10.1 million of the increase, as well as advancement of the clinical pipeline.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense was $202.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $49.0 million, or 32%, from $153.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The\nincrease was primarily due to continued investment to support our commercial activities including our expanding commercial portfolio.\nChange in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration. Change in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration was $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $29.0 million, or 150%, from $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change is related to the fair valuation of the potential future consideration to be paid to former equity holders of Agilis, as a result of our merger with Agilis which closed in August 2018. Changes in the fair value were due to the re-calculation of discounted cash flows for the passage of time and changes to certain other estimated assumptions.\nInterest expense, net. Net interest expense was $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1%, from net interest expense of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to increased interest income from investments, which partially offset current year interest expense recorded from the 2022 and 2026 Convertible Notes and the Credit Agreement.\nOther income, net. Other income, net was $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $13.6 million, over 100%, from other income, net of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in other income, net resulted primarily from a foreign exchange gain from the remeasurement of our intercompany loan and an unrealized gain on our equity investment in ClearPoint Neuro, Inc. (formerly MRI Interventions, Inc.), or our Equity Investment, of $2.2 million, partially offset by exchange rate changes in the current period.\nIncome tax (expense) benefit. Income tax expense was $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a change of $11.7 million, over 100%, from income tax benefit of $0.03 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We incurred income tax expense in various ex-U.S. jurisdictions, and our ex-U.S. tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of pre-tax earnings among these different jurisdictions. We are paying minimum income taxes in the United States because of incurred losses in the various state jurisdictions.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table summarizes revenues and selected expense and other income data for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 370: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n2018 vs. 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net product revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration and grant revenue\n</td> <td>1,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,597\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset\n</td> <td>12,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangible asset\n</td> <td>22,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expense\n</td> <td>171,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>153,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration\n</td> <td>19,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(12,554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,094\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,279\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,335\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet product revenue. Net product revenue was $263.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $88.9 million, or 51%, from net product revenue of $174.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net product revenue was primarily due to the increase in net product sales of $25.8 million in existing markets where Translarna is available as well as continued geographic expansion into new territories, in addition to an increase in $63.2 million in net product sales of Emflaza, which launched domestically in May 2017.\nCollaboration and grant revenue. Collaboration and grant revenue was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $18.6 million, or 91%, from collaboration and grant revenue of $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in collaboration and grant revenue was primarily due to the $20.0 million milestone achieved during the fourth quarter of 2017 from Roche. In October 2017, we announced that Sunfish, a two-part clinical trial in pediatric and adult type 2 and type 3 spinal muscular atrophy initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016, had transitioned into the pivotal second part of its study which triggered the milestone payment.\nCost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset. Cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset, was $12.7 million for the year end December 31, 2018, an increase of $8.1 million, or 177%, from $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of product sales consist primarily of royalty payments associated with Emflaza and Translarna net product sales and costs associated with Emflaza and Translarna product sold during the period. For Translarna sold in 2017, the majority of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed prior to January 1, 2017 as research and development expenses.\nAmortization of acquired intangible asset.
