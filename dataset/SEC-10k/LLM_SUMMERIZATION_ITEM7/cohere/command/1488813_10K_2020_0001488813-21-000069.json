Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with \"Business - Executive Summary\" and the Bancorp's consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020.\nOverview\nLike most financial institutions, Customers derives the majority of its income from interest it receives on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments. Customers' primary source of funds for making these loans and investments are its deposits and borrowings, on which it pays interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of Customers' success is the amount of its net interest income, or the difference between the income on its interest-earning assets and the expense on its interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, relative to the amount of average interest-earning assets, which is referred to as net interest margin.\nBankMobile, a division of Customers Bank, derived a majority of its revenue from interest income on installment loans, interchange and card revenue and deposit fees. On January 4, 2021, Customers Bancorp completed the divestiture of BankMobile Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Customers Bank and a component of BankMobile, through a merger with Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp. In connection with the closing of the divestiture, MFAC changed its name to BM Technologies, Inc.\u201d All of BankMobile's serviced deposits and loans including the related net interest income will remain with Customers Bank after the completion of the divestiture. Beginning in first quarter 2021, BMT's historical financial results for periods prior to the divestiture will be reflected in Customers Bancorp's results of operations as discontinued operations. Customers Bancorp's financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and the results of its operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included the assets and liabilities and financial results of BankMobile. As a result of the divestiture, Customers' interchange income, deposit account fees and subscription fees are expected to decrease. In addition, Customers' non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, technology, professional services, merger and acquisition related expenses and other non-interest expenses, including reimbursements from the white label relationship associated with BMT are expected to decrease. In connection with the divestiture, Customers has also entered into various agreements with BM Technologies, including a transition services agreement, software license agreement, deposit servicing agreement, non-competition agreement and loan agreement for periods ranging from one to ten years. Customers will continue to incur non-interest expenses associated with these agreements with BM Technologies in the future. See NOTE 26 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS to Customers Bancorp's audited financial statements for additional information.\nThere is credit risk inherent in all loans, so Customers maintains an ACL to absorb probable losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible. Customers maintains this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against its operating earnings. Customers has included a detailed discussion of this process, as well as several tables describing its ACL, in NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION and NOTE 7 - LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES to Customers' audited financial statements.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally, including the markets that Customers serves. Governmental responses during the pandemic have included orders closing businesses not deemed essential and directing individuals to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses that have led to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, material decreases in oil and gas prices and in business valuations, disrupted global supply chains, market downturns and volatility, changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears, related emergency response legislation and an expectation that Federal Reserve policy will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future.\nCustomers has taken deliberate actions to ensure that it has the necessary balance sheet strength to serve its clients and communities, including increases in liquidity and reserves supported by a strong capital position. Customers' business and consumer customers are experiencing varying degrees of financial distress, which is expected to continue in the coming months. In order to protect the health of its customers and team members, and to comply with applicable government directives, Customers has modified its business practices, including restricting team member travel, directing team members to work from home insofar as is possible and implementing its business continuity plans and protocols to the extent necessary. Customers also has made donations that have resulted in more than $1\nmillion, either directly or indirectly, to communities in its footprint for urgent basic needs and has been re-targeting existing sponsorship and grants to nonprofit organizations to support COVID-19 related activities.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. It contains substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes the SBA's PPP, a nearly $350 billion program designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans are intended to guarantee an eight-week or 24-week period of payroll and other costs to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to pay their bills. On April 16, 2020, the SBA announced that all available funds had been exhausted and applications were no longer being accepted. On April 22, 2020, an additional $310 billion of funds for the PPP was signed into law. On August 8, 2020, the SBA announced that the PPP was closed and no longer accepting PPP applications from participating lenders. However, on December 27, 2020, the CAA was signed into law, which provides $284 billion in additional funding for the SBA's PPP for small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CAA provides small businesses who received an initial PPP loan and experienced a 25% reduction in gross receipts to request a second PPP loan of up to $2.0 million. On January 11, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP program to small business and non-profit organizations that did not receive a loan through the initial PPP phase. As of December 31, 2020, Customers has helped thousands of small businesses by originating about $5.0 billion in PPP loans directly or through fintech partnerships. Customers also began accepting applications for the new round of PPP loans on January 11, 2021.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Customers has also implemented a loan modification program to provide temporary payment relief to certain of its borrowers who meet the program's qualifications. This program allows for a deferral of payments for a maximum of 90 days at a time. The deferred payments along with interest accrued during the deferral period are due and payable on the maturity date of the existing loan. As of December 31, 2020, total commercial deferments declined to $202.1 million, or 1.8% of total loans and leases, excluding PPP loans, from a peak of $1.2 billion earlier in 2020 and total consumer deferments declined to $16.4 million, or 0.1% of total loans and leases, excluding PPP loans. Excluding loans receivable, PPP from total loans and leases receivable is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers' financial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities. Please refer to the following reconciliation schedule.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans held for sale (GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value (GAAP) </td> <td>3,616,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans and leases receivable (GAAP) </td> <td>12,136,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans and leases receivable (GAAP) </td> <td>15,832,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Loans receivable, PPP </td> <td>4,561,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans and leases, excluding PPP (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,270,886 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial deferments (GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>202,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer deferments (GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial deferments to total loans and leases, excluding PPP (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer deferments to total loans and leases, excluding PPP (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe FRB has taken a range of actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. For example, on March 15, 2020, the FRB reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 0.25% and announced that it would increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowing by 150 basis points while extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve requirements have been reduced to zero as of March 26, 2020. The FRB has also established, or has taken steps to establish, a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19, including among others, Main Street Lending facilities to purchase loan participations, under specified conditions, from banks lending to small and medium U.S. businesses and the PPPLF, which was created to bolster the effectiveness of the PPP by taking loans as collateral at face value. While Customers has not participated in all of these facilities or programs to date, it may participate in some or all of these facilities or programs, including as a lender, agent, or intermediary on behalf of clients or customers at various times in the future. As of December 31, 2020, Customers had $4.4 billion in borrowing from the PPPLF.\nSignificant uncertainties as to future economic conditions exist, and Customers has taken deliberate actions in response, including higher levels of on-balance sheet liquidity and maintaining strong capital ratios. Additionally, the economic pressures, coupled with the implementation of an expected lifetime loss methodology for determining our provision for credit losses as required by CECL have contributed to an increased provision for credit losses on loans and leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures in first quarter 2020. Customers continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 closely, as well as any effects that may result from the CARES Act and the CAA; however, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact Customers' operations and financial results during 2021 is highly uncertain.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information about the impact that recently adopted, including CECL, or issued accounting guidance will have on us, refer to NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION to Customers' audited financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCustomers has adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of U.S. GAAP and that are consistent with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Customers' significant accounting policies are described in NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION to Customers' audited financial statements.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by Customers that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets. Customers considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions management makes, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of Customers' assets.\nThe critical accounting policy that is both important to the portrayal of Customers' financial condition and results of operations and require complex, subjective judgments is the ACL. This critical accounting policy and material estimate, along with the related disclosures, are reviewed by Customers' Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nCustomers' ACL at December 31, 2020 represents Customers' current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from its loan and lease portfolio and its unfunded lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. Management estimates the ACL by projecting a lifetime loss rate conditional on a forecast of economic parameters and other qualitative adjustments, for the loans and leases' expected remaining term.\nCustomers uses external sources in the creation of its forecasts, including current economic conditions and forecasts for macroeconomic variables over its reasonable and supportable forecast period (e.g., GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, BBB spread, commercial real estate and home price index). After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, which ranges from two to five years, the models revert the forecasted macroeconomic variables to their historical long-term trends, without specific predictions for the economy, over the expected life of the pool, while also incorporating prepayment assumptions into its lifetime loss rates. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. Significant loan/borrower attributes utilized in the models include property type, initial loan to value, assigned risk ratings, delinquency status, origination date, maturity date, initial FICO scores, and borrower state.\nThe ACL may be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that Customers considers to reflect its current judgement of various events and risks that are not measured in our statistical procedures, including uncertainty related to the economic forecasts used in the modeled credit loss estimates, nature and volume of the loan and lease portfolio, credit underwriting policy exceptions, peer comparison, industry data, and model and data limitations. The qualitative allowance for economic forecast risk is further informed by multiple alternative scenarios to arrive at a composite scenario supporting the period-end ACL balance. The evaluation process is inherently imprecise and subjective as it requires significant management judgment based on underlying factors that are susceptible to changes, sometimes materially and rapidly. Customers recognizes that this approach may not be suitable in certain economic environments such that additional analysis may be performed at management's discretion. Due in part to its subjectivity, the qualitative evaluation may be materially impacted during periods of economic uncertainty and late breaking events that could lead to revision of reserves to reflect management's best estimate of expected credit losses.\nThe ACL is established in accordance with our ACL policy. The ACL Committee, which includes the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Risk Officer, and Chief Credit Officer, among others, reviews the adequacy of the ACL each quarter, together\nwith Customers' risk management team. The ACL policy, significant judgements and the related disclosures are reviewed by Customers' Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe increase in our estimated ACL as of December 31, 2020 as compared to our January 1, 2020 estimate was primarily attributable to the significant economic impact of COVID-19 and the related federal stimulus from the federal government, along with loan growth in Customers' commercial and consumer loan portfolios. The total reserve build for the ACL for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.9 million, for an ending balance of $146.5 million ($144.2 million for loans and leases and $2.3 million for unfunded lending-related commitments) as of December 31, 2020.\nTo determine the ACL as of December 31, 2020, Customers utilized the Moody's December 2020 Baseline forecast to generate its modelled expected losses and considered Moody's other alternative economic forecast scenarios to qualitatively adjust the modelled ACL by loan portfolio in order to reflect management's reasonable expectations of current and future economic conditions. The Baseline forecast at December 31, 2020 assumed continued improvement in forecasts of macroeconomic conditions compared to the previous earlier forecasts of macroeconomic conditions used by Customers during 2020; the Federal Reserve maintaining a target range for the fed funds rate at 0% to 0.25% until the second half of 2023; and an additional $908 billion of stimulus from the federal government. Customers continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related policy measures on the economy and, if the depth of the recession or pace of the expected recovery is worse than expected, further meaningful provisions for credit losses could be required.\nOne of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL is the macro-economic forecasts from Moody's. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. Given the dynamic relationship between macro-economic variables within Customers' modelling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance. However, to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting applied to an adverse scenario. This scenario includes assumptions around new infections and COVID-19 deaths being significantly above the Baseline projections, leading to a much slower re-opening of the economy. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate remains elevated for a prolonged period and is estimated to remain at 9.0% and 9.1% at the end of 2021 and 2022, respectively. These numbers represent a 2.1% and 3.1% higher unemployment estimate than Baseline scenario projections of 6.9% and 6.0%, respectively for the same time periods. To demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters, management calculated the difference between a 100% baseline weighting and a 100% adverse scenario weighting for modeled results. This would result in an incremental quantitative allowance impact of approximately $60.8 million. This resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in ACL levels since (i) Customers uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its ACL process, (ii) the highly uncertain economic environment, (iii) the difficulty in predicting inter-relationships between macroeconomic variables used in various economic scenarios, and (iv) the sensitivity analysis does not account for any qualitative adjustments incorporated by Customers as part of its overall ACL framework.\nThere is no certainty that Customers' ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or Customers' markets, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of Customers' customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, Customers' net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on Customers' financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the current COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to negatively impact Customers' businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time.\nFor more information, see NOTE 7 - LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS AND LEASES to the audited financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of Customers Bancorp's consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements, including the accompanying notes. Please refer to Critical Accounting Policies in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION to Customers' audited financial statements for information concerning certain significant accounting policies and estimates applied in determining reported results of operations.\nThe following table sets forth the condensed statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>403,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>277,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses on loans and leases </td> <td> </td> <td>62,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>101,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>266,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>231,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>175,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>43,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>132,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred stock dividends </td> <td> </td> <td>14,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(418) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income available to common shareholders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomers reported net income available to common shareholders of $118.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Factors contributing to the change in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows:\nNet interest income\nNet interest income increased $126.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as average interest-earning assets increased by $4.8 billion, partially offset by a 4 basis point decline in NIM to 2.71% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decline in NIM resulted from the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts of 225 basis points beginning in August 2019 and the shift in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities drove a 94 basis point decline in the yield on interest-earning assets and a 117 basis point decline in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The largest shift in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities was the origination of $5.0 billion (with $4.6 billion balance at December 31, 2020 and $3.1 billion average balance) in PPP loans yielding 2.10% and related PPPLF borrowings of $4.4 billion at December 31, 2020 ($2.5 billion average balance) costing 0.35%. Customers' total cost of funds, including non-interest bearing deposits, was 0.97% and 1.95% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProvision for credit losses on loans and leases\nThe $38.5 million increase in the provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, reflects Customers' adoption of CECL and the impact of COVID-19. Upon adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020, the ACL for loans and leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures increased by $79.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is presented within accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the related provision is presented as part of other non-interest expense on the consolidated income statement. The ACL on loans and leases held for investment, represented 1.90% of total loans and leases receivable, excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP measure, please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation within Loans and Leases, Credit Risk), at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.77% at December 31, 2019.\nNet charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $54.8 million, or 41 basis points of average total loans and leases, compared to $7.8 million, or eight basis points of average total loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily due to partial charge-offs of $25.2 million for two commercial real estate collateral dependent loans during the year ended December 31, 2020, and an increase in charge-offs of installment loans coinciding with the growth of the portfolio year-over-year.\nNon-interest income\nThe $20.8 million increase in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted primarily from $19.1 million in gains realized from the sale of AFS debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2020, $7.5 million loss on acquisition of interest-only GNMA securities during the year ended December 31, 2019, and increases of $6.1 million in commercial lease income, $4.4 million in mortgage warehouse transactional fees, $1.6 million in mortgage banking income,\nand $1.0 million in deposit fees. These increases were offset in part by decreases of $7.9 million in interchange and card revenue, $10.1 million in other non-interest income, and $0.8 million in gains on sale of SBA and other loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNon-interest expense\nThe $34.8 million increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from increases of $18.4 million in salaries and employee benefits, $9.4 million in technology, communication, and bank operations, $5.8 million in FDIC assessments, non-income taxes, and regulatory fees, $5.2 million in commercial lease depreciation, $2.0 million in merger and acquisition related expenses, $1.9 million in professional services, and $1.5 million in loan workout costs. These increases were offset in part by decreases of $4.4 million in provision for operating losses, $1.8 million in advertising and promotion, and $2.6 million in other non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome tax expense\nCustomers' effective tax rate was 24.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 22.3% for the year the ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the dilution of the permanent tax differences and other tax benefits as a result of increased pre-tax income.\nPreferred stock dividends\nPreferred stock dividends were $14.0 million and $14.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no changes to the amount of preferred stock outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. On June 15, 2020, the Series C preferred stock became floating at three-month LIBOR plus 5.30% compared to a fixed rate of 7.00%.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income (the difference between the interest earned on loans and leases, investments and interest-earning deposits with banks, and interest paid on deposits, borrowed funds and subordinated debt) is the primary source of Customers' earnings. The following table summarizes Customers' net interest income, related interest spread, net interest margin and the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Information is provided for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities with respect to (i) changes attributable to volume (i.e., changes in average balances multiplied by the prior-period average rate) and (ii) changes attributable to rate (i.e., changes in average rate multiplied by prior-period average balances). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\nTable

These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities. Please refer to the reconciliation schedule that follows this table.\nNet interest income increased $126.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as average interest-earning assets increased by $4.8 billion primarily related to PPP loan originations, increases in installment loans, commercial loans to mortgage companies, commercial and industrial loans, investment securities, and interest earning deposits, partially\noffset by decreases in multi-family loans and residential mortgages. The overall average loans and leases receivable balance fluctuations were the result of Customers' strategic efforts to reduce the lower-yielding loans in the multi-family portfolio and replace them with higher-yielding commercial and industrial and installment loans.\nThe increase in average interest-earning assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was also offset partially by a 4 basis point decline in NIM to 2.71% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 2.75% for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting from the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts of 225 basis points beginning in August 2019 and the shift in the mix of interest-earning assets drove a 94 basis point decline in the yield on interest-earnings assets and an 117 basis point decline in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The largest shift in the mix of interest-earnings assets and interest-bearing liabilities was the origination of $4.6 billion ($3.1 billion average balance) in PPP loans yielding 2.10% and related PPPLF borrowings of $4.4 billion ($2.5 billion average balance) costing 0.35%. Customers' total cost of deposits, including interest-bearing and non-interest bearing) were 0.89% and 1.76% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCustomers' net interest margin tables contain non-GAAP financial measures which include net interest margin tax equivalent and net interest margin tax equivalent, excluding PPP loans. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to present the current period presentation to historical periods in prior filings. In addition, management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers' financial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities.\nA reconciliation of net interest margin tax equivalent and net interest margin tax equivalent, excluding PPP loans for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are set forth below.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income (GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>403,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>277,310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax-equivalent adjustment </td> <td>874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>735 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income tax equivalent (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>404,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>278,045 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable, PPP net interest income </td> <td>(54,583) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income tax equivalent, excluding PPP loans (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>278,045 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average total interest-earning assets (GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,933,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,123,708 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average PPP loans </td> <td>(3,121,157) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted average total interest-earning assets (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,812,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,123,708 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin (GAAP) </td> <td>2.70 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.74 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin tax equivalent (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>2.71 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin tax equivalent, excluding PPP loans (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>2.96 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nFor more information about the provision and Customers' ACL methodology and loss experience, see Critical Accounting Policies and Financial Condition - Loan and Leases, Credit Risk, and Asset Quality herein and NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION and NOTE 7 - LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES to Customers' audited financial statements.\nCustomers maintains an ACL to cover current expected credit losses as of the balance sheet date on loans and leases held for investment that are not reported at their fair value on a recurring basis. The ACL is increased through periodic provisions for credit losses on loans and leases that are charged as an expense on the consolidated statements of income and is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The loan and lease portfolio is reviewed quarterly to evaluate the performance of the portfolio and the adequacy of the ACL. The ACL is estimated as of the end of each quarter and compared to the balance recorded in the general ledger, net of charge-offs and recoveries. The allowance is adjusted to the estimated ACL balance with a corresponding charge (or debit) to the provision for credit losses on loans and leases.\nThe provision for credit losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the ACL at a level consistent with management's assessment of expected lifetime losses in the loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date. Customers recorded $62.8 million and a credit of $1.1 million of provision for credit losses for loans and leases and lending-related commitments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 utilizing the CECL methodology. The $38.5 million increase in the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects Customers' adoption of CECL, the impact of reserve build for the COVID-19 pandemic and the portfolio growth. Customers adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, the ACL for loans and leases and lending-related unfunded commitments increased by $79.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, with the after-tax cumulative effect recorded to retained earnings.\nNet charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $54.8 million, or 41 basis points of average total loans and leases, compared to $7.8 million, or 8 basis points of average total loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net charge-offs primarily relate to the partial charge-offs of two commercial real estate collateral dependent loans and charge-offs in consumer installment loans. The two commercial real estate collateral dependent loans were sold in August 2020 and January 2021.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nThe table below presents the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interchange and card revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,902) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit fees </td> <td>13,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lease income </td> <td>18,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank-owned life insurance </td> <td>7,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(263) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage warehouse transactional fees </td> <td>11,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on sale of SBA and other loans </td> <td>2,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(761) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking income </td> <td>1,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,465.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss upon acquisition of interest-only GNMA securities </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,476) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on sale of investment securities </td> <td>20,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,905.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities </td> <td>1,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>4,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,121) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterchange and card revenue\nThe $7.9 million decrease in interchange and card revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from Customers becoming subject to the Federal Reserve's regulation limiting interchange fees for banks over $10 billion in assets beginning on July 1, 2020. The interchange and card revenue is expected to decrease in 2021 as a result of the divestiture of BMT to MFAC on January 4, 2021.\nDeposit fees\nThe $1.0 million increase in deposit fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from an increase in service charges on certain deposit accounts relating to a change in the fee structure at the BankMobile segment, partially offset by lower activity volume. The deposit fees are expected to decrease significantly in 2021 as a result of the divestiture of BMT to MFAC on January 4, 2021.\nCommercial lease income\nCommercial lease income represents income earned on commercial operating leases generated by Customers' Equipment Finance Group in which Customers is the lessor. The $6.1 million increase in commercial lease income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from the continued growth of Customers' equipment finance business.\nMortgage warehouse transactional fees\nThe $4.4 million increase in mortgage warehouse transactional fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from an increase in refinancing activity driven by the decline in market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. There can be no assurance that the refinancing activity will remain elevated for Customers to earn mortgage warehouse transactional fees in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nGain (loss) on sale of SBA and other loans\nThe $0.8 million decrease in gain (loss) on sale of SBA and other loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from a strategic initiative to retain SBA loans on our balance sheet for the first nine months of 2019. Customers resumed selling these loans in fourth quarter 2019 that generated higher gains as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nMortgage banking income\nThe $1.6 million increase in mortgage banking income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from an increase in unrealized gains on derivatives and gains on sales of mortgage servicing rights during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLoss on acquisition of interest-only GNMA securities\nThe $7.5 million decrease in loss realized upon the acquisition of interest-only GNMA securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from a commercial mortgage warehouse customer that unexpectedly ceased operations in second quarter 2019. Customers took possession of the interest-only GNMA securities that served as the primary collateral for loans made to this mortgage warehouse customer. The shortfall in the fair value of the interest-only GNMA securities upon acquisition resulted in a write-down of $7.5 million in 2019. Customers views this as an isolated event that is not indicative of the overall credit quality of the mortgage warehouse portfolio. There are no other loans in the mortgage warehouse portfolio secured by interest-only securities. These securities were sold for $15.4 million with a realized gain of $1.0 million in 2020.\nGain (loss) on sale of investment securities\nThe $19.1 million increase in gain (loss) on sale of investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from a $20.1 million gain realized primarily from the sale of $162.7 million of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, $110.7 million in corporate notes, and $80.0 million in government agency securities for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a $1.0 million gain realized from the sale of $95 million of corporate notes for the year ended December 31, 2019. There can be no assurance that Customers will realize gains on the sale of investment securities in 2021, given significant uncertainty in the capital markets and Customers' investment strategy.\nOther non-interest income\nThe $10.1 million decrease in other non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from a net negative derivative valuation adjustment of $6.4 million, due to changes in market interest rates and a negative credit valuation adjustment from an interest rate swap associated with a non-performing borrower, a market value adjustment loss on two commercial real estate collateral dependent loans held for sale of $2.6 million in 2020, and a decrease in premiums from derivatives of $1.6 million.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE\nThe table below presents the components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2019 primarily resulted from an increase in average full-time equivalent team members needed for future growth, annual merit increases, and an increase in incentive accruals tied to Customers' overall performance.\nTechnology, communications, and bank operations\nThe $9.4 million increase in technology, communications, and bank operations expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from the continued investment in the white label relationship and digital transformation efforts.\nProfessional services\nThe $1.9 million increase in professional services for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from consulting services associated with supporting the white label relationship and digital transformation efforts.\nCommercial lease depreciation\nThe $5.2 million increase in commercial lease depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from the continued growth of the operating lease arrangements originated by Customers' Equipment Finance Group in which Customers is the lessor.\nFDIC assessments, non-income taxes, and regulatory fees\nThe $5.8 million increase in FDIC assessments, non-income taxes, and regulatory fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from an increase in FDIC assessment rates resulting from management's decision to grow the balance sheet beyond $10 billion in assets, as higher premiums became applicable, and the temporary utilization of brokered deposits to fund PPP loans.\nProvision for operating losses\nThe $4.4 million decrease in provision for operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from an internet-based organized crime ring that was identified during 2019 and initiatives by management to reduce fraud and theft-based losses during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAdvertising and promotion\nThe $1.8 million decrease in advertising and promotion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from a reduction in the promotion of Customers' digital banking products and service offerings available through our white label partnership.\nMerger and acquisition related expenses\nThe $2.0 million increase in merger and acquisition related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from the merger of BankMobile Technologies, Inc. and Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp.\nLoan workout\nThe $1.5 million increase in loan workout for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from the workout of two commercial relationships.\nOther non-interest expenses\nThe $2.6 million decrease in other non-interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from an increase in operating cost reimbursements from Customers' white label relationship, partially offset by a legal contingency accrual of $1.0 million related to the settlement of the previously disclosed matter with the ED.\nOn January 4, 2021, Customers completed the divestiture of BMT through a merger with MFAC. Accordingly, Customers' non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, technology, professional services, merger and acquisition related expenses and other non-interest expenses, including reimbursements from the white label relationship associated with BMT are expected to decrease in 2021 compared to 2020. In connection with the divestiture, we have entered into various agreements with BM Technologies, including a transition services agreement, software license agreement, deposit servicing agreement, non-competition agreement and loan agreement for periods ranging from one to ten years. Customers will continue to incur non-interest expenses associated with these agreements with BM Technologies in 2021. Beginning in first quarter 2021, BMT's historical financial results for periods prior to the divestiture will be reflected in Customers' consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe table below presents income tax expense and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income tax expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>43,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate </td> <td>24.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $20.6 million increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from an increase in pre-tax income. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from the dilution of the permanent tax differences and other tax benefits as a result of increased pre-tax income. For the reconciliation of the effective tax rate and the statutory federal tax rate, refer to Note 15 - INCOME TAXES to Customers' audited financial statements.\nPREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS\nPreferred stock dividends were $14.0 million and $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no changes to the amount of preferred stock outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. On June 15, 2020, the Series C preferred stock became floating at three-month LIBOR plus 5.30% compared to a fixed rate of 7.00%.\nFinancial Condition\nGeneral\nCustomers' total assets were $18.4 billion at December 31, 2020. This represented a $6.9 billion increase from total assets of $11.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets was primarily driven by increases of $4.6 billion in loans receivable, PPP, $1.4 billion in loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value, $614.4 million in investment securities, $480.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $256.4 million in loans and leases receivable, partially offset by a decrease of $407.2 million in loans held for sale and an increase in ACL of $87.8 million.\nTotal liabilities were $17.3 billion at December 31, 2020. This represented a $6.9 billion increase from $10.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in total liabilities primarily resulted from increases in the PPPLF of $4.4 billion and total deposits of $2.7 billion, offset in part by a reduction in federal funds purchased of $288.0 million.\nThe following table sets forth certain key condensed balance sheet data:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>693,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>480,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities, at fair value </td> <td>1,210,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>595,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>614,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans held for sale </td> <td>79,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>486,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(407,242) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(83.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value </td> <td>3,616,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,245,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,370,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable, PPP </td> <td>4,561,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,561,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans and leases receivable </td> <td>7,575,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,318,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>256,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for credit losses on loans and leases </td> <td>(144,176) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(56,379) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87,797) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets </td> <td>18,439,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,520,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,918,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits </td> <td>11,309,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,648,936 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,660,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal funds purchased </td> <td>250,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>538,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(288,000) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB advances </td> <td>850,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>850,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other borrowings </td> <td>124,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt </td> <td>181,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FRB PPP Liquidity Facility </td> <td>4,415,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,415,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities </td> <td>17,322,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,467,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,854,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity </td> <td>1,117,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,052,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,291 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities and shareholders' equity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,439,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,520,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,918,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and due from banks and interest-earning deposits. Cash and due from banks consists mainly of vault cash and cash items in the process of collection. Cash on hand and due from banks were $78.1 million and $33.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The cash on hand and cash due from banks balances vary from day to day, primarily due to fluctuations in customers' deposits with the Bank.\nInterest-earning deposits consist of cash deposited at other banks, primarily the FRB. Interest-earning deposits were $615.3 million and $179.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The balance of interest-earning deposits varies from day to day, depending on several factors, such as fluctuations in customers' deposits with Customers, payment of checks drawn on customers' accounts and strategic investment decisions made to maximize Customers' net interest income, while effectively managing interest-rate risk and liquidity. The increase in interest-earning deposits since December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from managing liquidity as Customers' total assets have substantially increased since December 31, 2019.\nInvestment Securities\nThe investment securities portfolio is an important source of interest income and liquidity. It consists of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (guaranteed by an agency of the United States government), U.S. government agency securities, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, state and political subdivision debt securities, corporate notes and marketable equity securities. In addition to generating revenue, the investment portfolio is maintained to manage interest-rate risk, provide liquidity, serve as collateral for other borrowings, and diversify the credit risk of interest-earning assets. The portfolio is structured to optimize net interest income given the changes in the economic environment, liquidity position and balance sheet mix.\nAt December 31, 2020, investment securities totaled $1.2 billion compared to $595.9 million at December 31, 2019. The increase primarily resulted from the purchases of asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, U.S. government agency securities, agency-guaranteed collateralized mortgage obligations, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, state and political subdivision debt securities, and corporate notes totaling $1.2 billion, partially offset by the sale of $387.8 million of U.S. government agency securities, agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, corporate notes, agency-guaranteed collateralized mortgage obligations, and interest-only GNMA securities and maturities, calls and principal repayments totaling $236.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe interest-only GNMA securities served as the primary collateral for loans made to one commercial mortgage warehouse customer. These securities are reported at fair value, with fair value changes recorded directly in earnings based on a fair value option election. These securities were sold for $15.4 million with a realized gain of $1.0 million in 2020.\nFor financial reporting purposes, AFS debt securities are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt securities, other than credit losses, are included in other comprehensive income (loss) and reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net of the related tax effect. Changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities and securities reported at fair value based on a fair value option election are recorded in non-interest income in the period in which they occur.\nThe following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of the investment securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available for sale debt securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed securities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>372,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>377,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. government agency securities </td> <td>20,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities </td> <td>61,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>273,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>278,321 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency-guaranteed collateralized mortgage obligations </td> <td>160,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateralized loan obligations </td> <td>32,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate notes (1)\n</td> <td>372,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>284,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>396,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>298,877 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private label collateralized mortgage obligations </td> <td>136,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State and political subdivision debt securities </td> <td>17,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,291 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available for sale debt securities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,174,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>557,891 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,206,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>577,198 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-only GNMA securities (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,272 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,406 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment securities, at fair value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,210,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>595,876 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)At December 31, 2020 and 2019, includes corporate notes issued by other domestic bank holding companies.\n(2)Reported at fair value with fair value changes recorded in non-interest income based on a fair value option election.\n(3)Includes equity securities issued by a foreign entity.\nThe following table sets forth information about the maturities and weighted-average yield of the investment securities portfolio.

relationships are primarily with small and middle market businesses and individual consumers primarily in Southeastern Pennsylvania (Bucks, Berks, Chester, Philadelphia and Delaware Counties); Rye Brook, New York (Westchester County); Hamilton, New Jersey (Mercer County); Boston, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Portsmouth, New Hampshire (Rockingham County); Manhattan and Melville, New York; Washington, D.C.; and Chicago, Illinois. The portfolios of loans to mortgage banking businesses is nationwide. The loan portfolio consists primarily of loans to support mortgage banking companies' funding needs, multi-family/commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans. Customers continues to focus on small and middle market business loans to grow its commercial lending efforts, particularly its commercial and industrial loan and lease portfolio and its specialty mortgage lending business. Customers also focuses its lending efforts on local-market mortgage and home equity lending and the origination and purchase of unsecured consumer loans (installment loans), including personal, student loan refinancing, and home improvement loans through arrangements with fintech companies and other market place lenders for both the Customers Bank Business Banking and BankMobile segments nationwide. Following the completion of the divestiture of BMT, BankMobile's loans and serviced deposits and the related net interest income will be combined with Customers' financial condition and the results of operations as a single reportable segment.\nCommercial Lending\nCustomers' commercial lending is divided into five groups: Business Banking, Small and Middle Market Business Banking, Multi-Family and Commercial Real Estate Lending, Mortgage Banking Lending, and Equipment Finance. This grouping is designed to allow\nfor greater resource deployment, higher standards of risk management, strong asset quality, lower interest-rate risk and higher productivity levels.\nThe commercial lending group focuses primarily on companies with annual revenues ranging from $1 million to $100 million, which typically have credit requirements between $0.5 million and $10 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Customers had $14.2 billion in commercial loans outstanding, totaling approximately 89.8% of its total loan and lease portfolio, which includes loans held for sale, loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value and PPP loans, compared to commercial loans outstanding of $8.4 billion, comprising approximately 83.8% of its total loan and lease portfolio, at December 31, 2019. Included in the $14.1 billion in commercial loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020 was $4.6 billion of PPP loans. The PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and earn a fixed interest rate of 1.00%.\nThe small and middle market business banking platform originates loans, including SBA loans, through the branch network sales force and a team of dedicated relationship managers. The support administration of this platform is centralized including risk management, product management, marketing, performance tracking and overall strategy. Credit and sales training has been established for Customers' sales force, ensuring that it has small business experts in place providing appropriate financial solutions to the small business owners in its communities. The division approach focuses on industries that offer high asset quality and are deposit rich to drive profitability.\nCustomers' lending to mortgage banking businesses primarily provides financing to mortgage bankers for residential mortgage originations from loan closing until sale in the secondary market. Many providers of liquidity in this segment exited the business in 2009 during a period of market turmoil. Customers saw an opportunity to provide liquidity to this business segment at attractive spreads, generate fee income and attract escrow deposits. The underlying residential loans are taken as collateral for Customers' commercial loans to the mortgage companies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, commercial loans to mortgage banking businesses totaled $3.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, and are reported as loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet.\nCustomers intends to continue to deemphasize its lower-yielding multi-family loan portfolio, and invest in higher-yielding commercial and industrial loans with the multi-family run-off. Customers' multi-family lending group continues to focus on retaining a portfolio of high-quality multi-family loans within Customers' covered markets while cross-selling other products and services.

enforcing prudent underwriting standards and collection efforts and continuous and periodic loan and lease classification reviews. Management also considers the effect of credit risk on financial performance by reviewing quarterly and maintaining an adequate ACL. Credit losses are charged-off when they are identified, and provisions are added for current expected credit losses, to the ACL at least quarterly. The ACL is estimated at least quarterly.\nThe provision for credit losses on loans and leases was $62.8 million and $24.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The ACL maintained for loans and leases receivable (excluding loans held for sale and loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value and PPP loans) was $144.2 million, or 1.90% of loans and leases receivable at December 31, 2020, and $56.4 million, or 0.77% of loans receivable, at December 31, 2019. Excluding loans receivable, PPP from total loans and leases receivable is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers'\nfinancial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities. Please refer to the reconciliation schedule below. Net charge-offs were $54.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $47.0 million compared to $7.8 million for the year ending December 31, 2019. The increase in the ACL resulted primarily from the impact of reserve build for the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly attributable to the commercial real estate non-owner occupied and installment portfolios, and portfolio growth. Commercial real estate non-owner occupied charge-offs were attributable to the partial charge-off of two collateral dependent loans, which are not indicative of the overall commercial real estate portfolio. Installment charge-offs were attributable to originated and purchased unsecured consumer loans through arrangements with fintech companies and other market place lenders.\nA reconciliation of the coverage of ACL for loans and leases held for investment to the ACL for loans and leases held for investment, excluding PPP loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are set forth below.\nTable 35:

amounts exclude the benefit/(cost) of FDIC loss sharing arrangements of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe ACL is based on a quarterly evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio and is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to absorb expected losses as of the balance sheet date. All commercial loans, with the exception of PPP loans and commercial\nmortgage warehouse loans, which are reported at fair value, are assigned internal credit-risk ratings, based upon an assessment of the borrower, the structure of the transaction and the available collateral and/or guarantees. All loans and leases are monitored regularly by the responsible officer, and the risk ratings are adjusted when considered appropriate. The risk assessment allows management to identify problem loans and leases timely. Management considers a variety of factors and recognizes the inherent risk of loss that always exists in the lending process. Management uses a disciplined methodology to estimate an appropriate level of ACL. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies herein and NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION to Customers' audited financial statements for Customers' adoption of CECL and management's methodology for estimating the ACL.\nApproximately 65.6% of Customers' commercial real estate, commercial and residential construction, consumer residential and commercial and industrial loan types have real estate as collateral (collectively, the real estate portfolio\u201d), primarily in the form of a first lien position. Current appraisals providing current value estimates of the property are received when Customers' credit group determines that the facts and circumstances have significantly changed since the date of the last appraisal, including that real estate values have deteriorated. The credit committee and loan officers review loans that are 15 or more days delinquent and all non-accrual loans on a periodic basis. In addition, loans where the loan officers have identified a borrower of interest\u201d are discussed to determine if additional analysis is necessary to apply the risk-rating criteria properly. The risk ratings for the real estate loan portfolio are determined based upon the current information available, including but not limited to discussions with the borrower, updated financial information, economic conditions within the geographic area and other factors that may affect the cash flow of the loan. If a loan is individually evaluated for impairment, the collateral value or discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to determine the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, net of estimated selling costs, and compared to the outstanding loan balance to determine the amount of reserve necessary, if any. Appraisals used in this evaluation process are typically less than two years aged. For loans where real estate is not the primary source of collateral, updated financial information is obtained, including accounts receivable and inventory aging reports and relevant supplemental financial data to estimate the fair value of the loan, net of estimated selling costs, and compared to the outstanding loan balance to estimate the required reserve.\nThese impairment measurements are inherently subjective as they require material estimates, including, among others, estimates of property values in appraisals, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on individual loans, and general considerations for historical loss experience, economic conditions, uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios, all of which require judgment and may be susceptible to significant change over time and as a result of changing economic conditions or other factors. Pursuant to ASC 326, individually assessed loans, consisting primarily of non-accrual and restructured loans, are considered in the methodology for determining the ACL. Individually assessed loans are generally evaluated based on the expected future cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral (less estimated costs to sell) if principal repayment is expected to come from the sale or operation of such collateral. Shortfalls in the underlying collateral value for loans or leases determined to be collateral dependent are charged off immediately. Subsequent to an appraisal or other fair value estimate, management will assess whether there was a further decline in the value of the collateral based on changes in market conditions or property use that would require additional impairment to be recorded to reflect the particular situation, thereby increasing the ACL on loans and leases.\nThe following table shows the ACL by various portfolios as

Customers has established credit policies and procedures, seeks the consistent application of those policies and procedures across the organization and adjusts policies as appropriate for changes in market conditions and applicable regulations.\nProblem Loan Identification and Management\nTo facilitate the monitoring of credit quality within the commercial and industrial, multi-family, commercial real estate and construction portfolios and for purposes of analyzing historical loss rates used in the determination of the ACL for individually assessed loans, Customers utilizes the following categories of risk ratings: pass (there are six risk ratings for pass loans), special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. The risk-rating categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions, are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers and updated regularly thereafter. Pass ratings, which are assigned to those borrowers who do not have identified potential or well-defined weaknesses and for whom there is a high likelihood of orderly repayment, are updated periodically based on the size and credit characteristics of the borrower. All other categories are updated on a quarterly basis, generally during the month preceding the end of the calendar quarter. While assigning risk ratings involves judgment, the risk-rating process allows management to identify riskier credits in a timely manner and allocate the appropriate resources to manage the loans and leases. PPP loans are excluded as these loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA.\nCustomers assigns a special mention rating to loans and leases that have potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If not addressed, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan and lease and Customers' financial position. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, special mention loans and leases were $250.6 million and $111.2 million, respectively, and are considered performing loans and are therefore not included in the tables above.\nRisk ratings are not established for residential real estate, home equity loans, and installment loans mainly because these portfolios consist of a larger number of homogeneous loans with smaller balances. Instead, these portfolios are evaluated for risk mainly based on aggregate payment history through the monitoring of delinquency levels and trends.\nA regular reporting and review process is in place to provide for proper portfolio oversight and control and to monitor those loans and leases identified as problem credits by management. This process is designed to assess Customers' progress in working toward a solution and to assist in determining an appropriate ACL. All loan work-out situations involve the active participation of management and are reported regularly to the Board of Directors. When a loan or lease becomes delinquent for 90 days or more, or earlier if considered appropriate, the loan is assigned to Customers' Special Asset Group for workout or other resolution.\nLoan and lease charge-offs are determined on a case-by-case basis. Loans and leases are generally charged-off when principal is likely to be unrecoverable and after appropriate collection steps have been taken. Loan and lease charge-offs are proposed by the SAG and approved by the Board of Directors.\nLoan and lease policies and procedures are reviewed internally for possible revisions and changes on a regular basis. In addition, these policies and procedures, together with the loan and lease portfolio, are reviewed on a periodic basis by various regulatory agencies and by our internal, external and loan review auditors, as part of their examination and audit procedures.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nAt December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 there were $16.1 million, $13.3 million and $19.2 million, respectively, in loans categorized as a TDR. TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the period of their restructuring and are evaluated to determine whether they should be placed on non-accrual status. In subsequent years, a TDR may be returned to accrual status if the borrower satisfies a minimum six-month performance requirement; however, it will remain classified as impaired. Generally, Customers requires sustained performance for nine months before returning a TDR to accrual status.\nModification of PCD loans that are accounted for within loan pools in accordance with the accounting standards for PCD loans does not result in the removal of these loans from the pool even if the modification would otherwise be considered a TDR. Accordingly, as each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an expectation of cash flows, modifications of loans within such pools are not reported as TDRs.\nTDR modifications primarily involve interest-rate concessions, extensions of term, deferrals of principal and other modifications. Other modifications typically reflect other nonstandard terms which Customers would not offer in non-troubled situations. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, loans aggregating $3.7 million, $1.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, were modified in TDRs. TDR modifications of loans within the commercial and industrial category were primarily extensions of term, deferrals of principal and other modifications; modifications of residential real estate loans were primarily extensions of term and deferrals of principal; and modifications of manufactured housing loans were primarily interest rate concessions, extensions of term and deferrals of principal. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans have been modified in TDRs. As of December 31, 2018, except for one commercial and industrial loan with an outstanding commitment of $1.5 million, there were no other commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans have been modified in TDRs.\nAs of December 31, 2020, fifteen installment loans totaling $226 thousand, six manufactured housing loans totaling $236 thousand and three residential real estate loans totaling $152 thousand that were modified in TDRs within the past twelve months defaulted on payments. As of December 31, 2019, three manufactured housing loans totaling $73 thousand and one residential real estate loan for $81 thousand that were modified in TDRs within the past twelve months defaulted on payments. As of December 31, 2018, four manufactured housing loans totaling $92 thousand that were modified in TDRs within the past twelve months defaulted on payments.\nLoans modified in TDRs are evaluated for impairment. The nature and extent of impairment of TDRs, including those that have experienced a subsequent default, is considered in the determination of an appropriate level of ACL.\nACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE\nAt December 31, 2020, accrued interest receivable totaled $80.4 million compared to $38.1 million at December 31, 2019. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in outstanding balances of interest-earning assets.\nBANK PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT AND OTHER ASSETS\nAt December 31, 2020, bank premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, totaled $11.6 million compared to $9.4 million at December 31, 2019. The increase primarily resulted from purchases of bank premises and equipment of $4.7 million, partially offset by depreciation and amortization expenses of $2.5 million.\nAt December 31, 2020, Customers Bank's restricted stock holdings totaled $71.4 million compared to $84.2 million at December 31, 2019. These holdings consist of stock of the Federal Reserve Bank, the FHLB and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and are required as part of our relationship with these banks.\nAt December 31, 2020, the cash surrender value of BOLI totaled $280.1 million compared to $272.5 million at December 31, 2019. Presented within BOLI on the consolidated balance sheet is the cash surrender value of the SERP balances of $4.3 million and $3.8 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, other assets totaled $389.7 million and $298.1 million, respectively. Other assets consist primarily of cash pledged for swaps, ROU lease assets (the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 resulted in ROU lease assets of $20.2 million at December 31, 2019), operating leases through Customers' Equipment Finance Group (net investment in operating leases of $103.9 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $94.7 million at December 31, 2019), mark-to-market adjustments for interest-rate swaps, software, deferred tax assets, net and prepaid expenses.\nDEPOSITS\nCustomers offers a variety of deposit accounts, including checking, savings, MMDA and time deposits.

Non-time deposits increased by $3.7 billion, or 52.7%, to $10.7 billion at December 31, 2020, from $7.0 billion at December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by Customers' initiative to improve its net interest margin by expanding its sources of lower-cost funding. These efforts led to increases in non-interest bearing demand deposits of $1.0 billion, interest bearing demand deposits of $1.1 billion and savings, including MMDA, of $1.5 billion. These increases were offset in part by decreases in time deposits of $1.0 billion, or 60.9%.\nAt December 31, 2020 the Bank had $1.2 billion in state and municipal deposits to which it had pledged $1.2 billion of available borrowing capacity through the FHLB to the depositors through a letter of credit arrangement.\nTime deposits greater than $250,000 totaled $0.3 billion and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nAverage deposit balances by type and the associated average rate paid are summarized below:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>Average\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nRate Paid </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nRate Paid </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Demand, non-interest bearing </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,052,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,430,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Demand, interest-bearing </td> <td>2,098,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.89 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>955,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings, including MMDA </td> <td>4,819,894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.08 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3,689,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.17 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits </td> <td>1,357,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.58 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,943,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,328,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.89 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,018,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.76 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2020, the scheduled maturities of time deposits greater than $100,000 were as follows:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands) </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 months or less </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154,374 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 3 through 6 months </td> <td>95,898 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 6 through 12 months </td> <td>134,502 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 12 months </td> <td>86,149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>470,923 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information, see NOTE 10 - DEPOSITS to Customers' audited financial statements.\nFHLB ADVANCES AND OTHER BORROWINGS\nBorrowed funds from various sources are generally used to supplement deposit growth and meet other operating needs.

The increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net primarily resulted from a decline in the fair value of cash flow hedges, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of AFS debt securities, both due to the decline in market interest rates during the year. The increases in additional paid in capital resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock under share-based compensation arrangements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity for a financial institution is a measure of that institution's ability to meet depositors' needs for funds, to satisfy or fund loan commitments and for other operating purposes. Ensuring adequate liquidity is an objective of the asset/liability management process. Customers coordinates its management of liquidity with its interest-rate sensitivity and capital position and strives to maintain a strong liquidity position that is sufficient to meet Customers' short-term and long-term needs, commitments and contractual obligations.\nCustomers' investment portfolio provides periodic cash flows through regular maturities and amortization and can be used as collateral to secure additional funding. Customers' principal sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans and leases, other funds from operations, and proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances. Borrowing arrangements are maintained with the FHLB and the FRB to meet short-term liquidity needs. Longer-term borrowing arrangements are also maintained with the FHLB. As of December 31, 2020, Customers' borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $2.7 billion, of which $0.9 billion was utilized in borrowings and commitments and $1.2 billion of available capacity was utilized to collateralize state and municipal deposits. As of December 31, 2019, Customers' borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $3.4 billion, of which $0.9 billion was utilized in borrowings and commitments; and $1.4 billion of available capacity was used to collateralize state and municipal deposits. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Customers' borrowing capacity with the FRB was $223.3 million and $136.8 million, respectively.\nBeginning in second quarter 2020, Customers began participating in the PPPLF, in which Federal Reserve Banks extend non-recourse loans to institutions that are eligible to make PPP loans. Only PPP loans that are guaranteed by the SBA under the PPP, with respect to both principal and interest that are originated or purchased by an eligible institution, may be pledged as collateral to the Federal Reserve Banks. As of December 31, 2020, Customers had $4.4 billion in borrowings under the PPPLF. Customers expects to continue utilizing the PPPLF to fund additional PPP loans to be originated under the CAA in 2021.\nThe principal source of the Bancorp's liquidity is the dividends it receives from the Bank, which may be impacted by the following: bank-level capital needs, laws and regulations, corporate policies, contractual restrictions and other factors. The Bank has generated sufficient positive cash flows from operations to pay dividends to the Bancorp. However, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the Bancorp or its non-bank subsidiaries.\nThe table below summarizes Customers' cash flows for the years indicated:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from purchases of loans of $1.2 billion and net originations of mortgage warehouse loans of $881.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sales of loans of $273.4 million, a decrease in loans and leases, excluding mortgage warehouse loans, of $239.0 million and proceeds from sales of investment securities available for sale of $97.6 million.\nCash flows provided by (used in) financing activities\nCash provided by financing activities of $6.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily resulted from net increases in long-term borrowed funds from the FRB of $4.4 billion primarily to finance the PPP loan originations, and an increase in deposits of $2.7 billion, partially offset by net decrease in federal funds purchased of $288.0 million.\nCash provided by financing activities of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from an increase in deposits of $1.5 billion, proceeds from long-term FHLB borrowings of $350.0 million and net federal funds purchased of $351.0 million, partially offset by repayment of short-term borrowed funds from the FHLB of $748.1 million.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY\nThe Bank and Bancorp are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Customers' financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank and Bancorp must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under the regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies.\nIn first quarter 2020, U.S federal banking regulatory agencies permitted banking organizations to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new CECL accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years. As part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, on March 31, 2020, the U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule allows banking organizations to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. Customers has elected to adopt the interim final rule, which is reflected in the regulatory capital data presented below.\nIn April 2020, the U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that permits banks to exclude the impact of participating in the SBA PPP program in their regulatory capital ratios. Specifically, PPP loans are zero percent risk weighted and a bank can exclude all PPP loans pledged as collateral to the PPPLF from its average total consolidated assets for purposes of calculating the Tier 1 capital to average assets ratio (i.e. leverage ratio). Customers applied this regulatory guidance in the calculation of its regulatory capital ratios presented below.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank and the Bancorp to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total capital to risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined in the regulations). At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank and the Bancorp met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject.\nGenerally, to comply with the regulatory definition of adequately capitalized, or well capitalized, respectively, or to comply with the Basel III capital requirements, an institution must at least maintain the common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios and the Tier 1 leverage ratio in excess of the related minimum ratios set forth in the following table.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

January 1, 2016. Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will result in limitations on capital distributions and on discretionary bonuses to executive officers. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank and Customers Bancorp were in compliance with the Basel III requirements. See NOTE 18 - REGULATORY CAPITAL to Customers' audited financial statements for additional discussion regarding regulatory capital requirements.\nCapital Ratios\nCustomers continued to build capital during 2020 and 2019. However, the decision made in fourth quarter 2019 to cross the $10.0 billion asset threshold at year-end, with total assets of $11.5 billion at December 31, 2019, resulted in lower capital ratios when compared to December 31, 2018. In general, for the past few years, Customers Bancorp capital growth has been achieved by retained earnings and issuances of common stock under share-based compensation arrangements, offset in part by the repurchase of common shares. Customers Bancorp did not repurchase any common shares under a stock repurchase plan in 2020. Customers Bank capital growth has been achieved by retained earnings and capital contributions from Customers Bancorp from proceeds received from issuances of senior and subordinated notes. During 2020 and 2019, Customers Bancorp did not issue any preferred stock or common stock other than in connection with share-based compensation agreements. For more information relating to preferred and common stock, see NOTE 12 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY to Customers' audited financial statements.\nCustomers is unaware of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on its liquidity, capital resources, or operations.\nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is an important objective of Customers' asset and liability management process. Through its initial capitalization and subsequent offerings, Customers believes it has continued to maintain a strong capital position. Since first quarter 2015, Customers Bank's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend to the Bank's sole shareholder, Customers Bancorp. Cash dividends declared by the Bank and paid to Customers Bancorp during 2020 and 2019, include the following:\n\u2022$14.5 million declared on January 30, 2019, and paid on March 11, 2019;\n\u2022$15.5 million declared on April 22, 2019, and paid on June 10, 2019;\n\u2022$20.0 million declared on July 24, 2019, and paid on September 10, 2019;\n\u2022$20.0 million declared on October 23, 2019, and paid on December 10, 2019;\n\u2022$20.0 million declared on January 22, 2020, and paid on March 10, 2020;\n\u2022$20.0 million declared on April 22, 2020, and paid on June 10, 2020;\n\u2022$5.0 million declared on July 22, 2020, and paid on September 10, 2020; and\n\u2022$20.0 million declared and paid on December 31, 2020.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nCustomers is involved with financial instruments and other commitments with off-balance sheet risks. Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks are incurred in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of the Bank's customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, including unused portions of lines of credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet.\nWith commitments to extend credit, exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The same credit policies are used in making commitments and conditional obligations as for on-balance-sheet instruments. Because they involve credit risk similar to extending a loan and lease, these financial instruments are subject to the Bank's credit policy and other underwriting standards.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the following off-balance sheet commitments, financial instruments and other arrangements were outstanding:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to fund loans and leases </td> <td>$ </td> <td>262,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded commitments to fund mortgage warehouse loans </td> <td>1,933,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,378,364 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded commitments under lines of credit and credit cards </td> <td>1,009,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,065,474 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit </td> <td>27,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other unused commitments </td> <td>1,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,736 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitments to fund loans and leases, unfunded commitments to fund mortgage warehouse loans, unfunded commitments under lines of credit, letters of credit, and credit cards are agreements to extend credit to or for the benefit of a customer in the ordinary course of the Bank's business.\nCommitments to fund loans and leases and unfunded commitments under lines of credit may be obligations of the Bank as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Because many of the commitments are expected to expire without having been drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if the Bank deems it to be necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include personal or commercial real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.\nMortgage warehouse loan commitments are agreements to fund the pipelines of mortgage banking businesses from closing of individual mortgage loans until their sale into the secondary market. Most of the individual mortgage loans are insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government through one of its programs such as FHA, VA, or they are conventional loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac. These commitments generally fluctuate monthly based on changes in interest rates, refinance activity, new home sales and laws and regulation.\nOutstanding letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Letters of credit may obligate the Bank to fund draws under those letters of credit whether or not a customer continues to meet the conditions of the extension of credit. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan and lease facilities to customers.\nAs described in Note 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION to Customers' audited financial statements, ACL on lending related commitments is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which Customers is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No ACL is recognized if Customers have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. Off-balance-sheet credit commitments primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit disclosed above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance-sheet exposure. Customers estimates the expected credit losses for undrawn or unfunded commitments using a usage given default calculation. The lifetime loss rates for off-balance sheet credit exposures are calculated in the same manner as on-balance sheet credit exposures, using the same models and economic forecasts, adjusted for the estimated likelihood that funding will occur. Customers recorded $3.4 million of ACL for lending related commitments upon its adoption of ASC 326 and recognized a credit loss benefit of $1.1 million during the year resulting in an ACL of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2020.

These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans and leases, investments, and deposits, and their use may also affect rates charged on loans and leases or paid for deposits.", "summary": "- The company reported net income of $53.3m, or 67 cents per share, down from $79.3m, or 92 cents per share, in the prior quarter but up from a

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with \"Business - Executive Summary\" and the Bancorp's consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020.\nOverview\nLike most financial institutions, Customers derives the majority of its income from interest it receives on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments. Customers' primary source of funds for making these loans and investments are its deposits and borrowings, on which it pays interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of Customers' success is the amount of its net interest income, or the difference between the income on its interest-earning assets and the expense on its interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, relative to the amount of average interest-earning assets, which is referred to as net interest margin.\nBankMobile, a division of Customers Bank, derived a majority of its revenue from interest income on installment loans, interchange and card revenue and deposit fees. On January 4, 2021, Customers Bancorp completed the divestiture of BankMobile Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Customers Bank and a component of BankMobile, through a merger with Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp. In connection with the closing of the divestiture, MFAC changed its name to BM Technologies, Inc.\u201d All of BankMobile's serviced deposits and loans including the related net interest income will remain with Customers Bank after the completion of the divestiture. Beginning in first quarter 2021, BMT's historical financial results for periods prior to the divestiture will be reflected in Customers Bancorp's results of operations as discontinued operations. Customers Bancorp's financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and the results of its operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included the assets and liabilities and financial results of BankMobile. As a result of the divestiture, Customers' interchange income, deposit account fees and subscription fees are expected to decrease. In addition, Customers' non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, technology, professional services, merger and acquisition related expenses and other non-interest expenses, including reimbursements from the white label relationship associated with BMT are expected to decrease. In connection with the divestiture, Customers has also entered into various agreements with BM Technologies, including a transition services agreement, software license agreement, deposit servicing agreement, non-competition agreement and loan agreement for periods ranging from one to ten years. Customers will continue to incur non-interest expenses associated with these agreements with BM Technologies in the future. See NOTE 26 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS to Customers Bancorp's audited financial statements for additional information.\nThere is credit risk inherent in all loans, so Customers maintains an ACL to absorb probable losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible. Customers maintains this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against its operating earnings. Customers has included a detailed discussion of this process, as well as several tables describing its ACL, in NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION and NOTE 7 - LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES to Customers' audited financial statements.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally, including the markets that Customers serves. Governmental responses during the pandemic have included orders closing businesses not deemed essential and directing individuals to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses that have led to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, material decreases in oil and gas prices and in business valuations, disrupted global supply chains, market downturns and volatility, changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears, related emergency response legislation and an expectation that Federal Reserve policy will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future.\nCustomers has taken deliberate actions to ensure that it has the necessary balance sheet strength to serve its clients and communities, including increases in liquidity and reserves supported by a strong capital position. Customers' business and consumer customers are experiencing varying degrees of financial distress, which is expected to continue in the coming months. In order to protect the health of its customers and team members, and to comply with applicable government directives, Customers has modified its business practices, including restricting team member travel, directing team members to work from home insofar as is possible and implementing its business continuity plans and protocols to the extent necessary. Customers also has made donations that have resulted in more than $1\nmillion, either directly or indirectly, to communities in its footprint for urgent basic needs and has been re-targeting existing sponsorship and grants to nonprofit organizations to support COVID-19 related activities.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. It contains substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes the SBA's PPP, a nearly $350 billion program designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans are intended to guarantee an eight-week or 24-week period of payroll and other costs to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to pay their bills. On April 16, 2020, the SBA announced that all available funds had been exhausted and applications were no longer being accepted. On April 22, 2020, an additional $310 billion of funds for the PPP was signed into law. On August 8, 2020, the SBA announced that the PPP was closed and no longer accepting PPP applications from participating lenders. However, on December 27, 2020, the CAA was signed into law, which provides $284 billion in additional funding for the SBA's PPP for small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CAA provides small businesses who received an initial PPP loan and experienced a 25% reduction in gross receipts to request a second PPP loan of up to $2.0 million. On January 11, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP program to small business and non-profit organizations that did not receive a loan through the initial PPP phase. As of December 31, 2020, Customers has helped thousands of small businesses by originating about $5.0 billion in PPP loans directly or through fintech partnerships. Customers also began accepting applications for the new round of PPP loans on January 11, 2021.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Customers has also implemented a loan modification program to provide temporary payment relief to certain of its borrowers who meet the program's qualifications. This program allows for a deferral of payments for a maximum of 90 days at a time. The deferred payments along with interest accrued during the deferral period are due and payable on the maturity date of the existing loan. As of December 31, 2020, total commercial deferments declined to $202.1 million, or 1.8% of total loans and leases, excluding PPP loans, from a peak of $1.2 billion earlier in 2020 and total consumer deferments declined to $16.4 million, or 0.1% of total loans and leases, excluding PPP loans. Excluding loans receivable, PPP from total loans and leases receivable is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers' financial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities. Please refer to the following reconciliation schedule.\n\nThe FRB has taken a range of actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. For example, on March 15, 2020, the FRB reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 0.25% and announced that it would increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowing by 150 basis points while extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve requirements have been reduced to zero as of March 26, 2020. The FRB has also established, or has taken steps to establish, a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19, including among others, Main Street Lending facilities to purchase loan participations, under specified conditions, from banks lending to small and medium U.S. businesses and the PPPLF, which was created to bolster the effectiveness of the PPP by taking loans as collateral at face value. While Customers has not participated in all of these facilities or programs to date, it may participate in some or all of these facilities or programs, including as a lender, agent, or intermediary on behalf of clients or customers at various times in the future. As of December 31, 2020, Customers had $4.4 billion in borrowing from the PPPLF.\nSignificant uncertainties as to future economic conditions exist, and Customers has taken deliberate actions in response, including higher levels of on-balance sheet liquidity and maintaining strong capital ratios. Additionally, the economic pressures, coupled with the implementation of an expected lifetime loss methodology for determining our provision for credit losses as required by CECL have contributed to an increased provision for credit losses on loans and leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures in first quarter 2020. Customers continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 closely, as well as any effects that may result from the CARES Act and the CAA; however, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact Customers' operations and financial results during 2021 is highly uncertain.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information about the impact that recently adopted, including CECL, or issued accounting guidance will have on us, refer to NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION to Customers' audited financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCustomers has adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of U.S. GAAP and that are consistent with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Customers' significant accounting policies are described in NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION to Customers' audited financial statements.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by Customers that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets. Customers considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions management makes, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of Customers' assets.\nThe critical accounting policy that is both important to the portrayal of Customers' financial condition and results of operations and require complex, subjective judgments is the ACL. This critical accounting policy and material estimate, along with the related disclosures, are reviewed by Customers' Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nCustomers' ACL at December 31, 2020 represents Customers' current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from its loan and lease portfolio and its unfunded lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. Management estimates the ACL by projecting a lifetime loss rate conditional on a forecast of economic parameters and other qualitative adjustments, for the loans and leases' expected remaining term.\nCustomers uses external sources in the creation of its forecasts, including current economic conditions and forecasts for macroeconomic variables over its reasonable and supportable forecast period (e.g., GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, BBB spread, commercial real estate and home price index). After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, which ranges from two to five years, the models revert the forecasted macroeconomic variables to their historical long-term trends, without specific predictions for the economy, over the expected life of the pool, while also incorporating prepayment assumptions into its lifetime loss rates. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. Significant loan/borrower attributes utilized in the models include property type, initial loan to value, assigned risk ratings, delinquency status, origination date, maturity date, initial FICO scores, and borrower state.\nThe ACL may be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that Customers considers to reflect its current judgement of various events and risks that are not measured in our statistical procedures, including uncertainty related to the economic forecasts used in the modeled credit loss estimates, nature and volume of the loan and lease portfolio, credit underwriting policy exceptions, peer comparison, industry data, and model and data limitations. The qualitative allowance for economic forecast risk is further informed by multiple alternative scenarios to arrive at a composite scenario supporting the period-end ACL balance. The evaluation process is inherently imprecise and subjective as it requires significant management judgment based on underlying factors that are susceptible to changes, sometimes materially and rapidly. Customers recognizes that this approach may not be suitable in certain economic environments such that additional analysis may be performed at management's discretion. Due in part to its subjectivity, the qualitative evaluation may be materially impacted during periods of economic uncertainty and late breaking events that could lead to revision of reserves to reflect management's best estimate of expected credit losses.\nThe ACL is established in accordance with our ACL policy. The ACL Committee, which includes the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Risk Officer, and Chief Credit Officer, among others, reviews the adequacy of the ACL each quarter, together\nwith Customers' risk management team. The ACL policy, significant judgements and the related disclosures are reviewed by Customers' Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe increase in our estimated ACL as of December 31, 2020 as compared to our January 1, 2020 estimate was primarily attributable to the significant economic impact of COVID-19 and the related federal stimulus from the federal government, along with loan growth in Customers' commercial and consumer loan portfolios. The total reserve build for the ACL for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.9 million, for an ending balance of $146.5 million ($144.2 million for loans and leases and $2.3 million for unfunded lending-related commitments) as of December 31, 2020.\nTo determine the ACL as of December 31, 2020, Customers utilized the Moody's December 2020 Baseline forecast to generate its modelled expected losses and considered Moody's other alternative economic forecast scenarios to qualitatively adjust the modelled ACL by loan portfolio in order to reflect management's reasonable expectations of current and future economic conditions. The Baseline forecast at December 31, 2020 assumed continued improvement in forecasts of macroeconomic conditions compared to the previous earlier forecasts of macroeconomic conditions used by Customers during 2020; the Federal Reserve maintaining a target range for the fed funds rate at 0% to 0.25% until the second half of 2023; and an additional $908 billion of stimulus from the federal government. Customers continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related policy measures on the economy and, if the depth of the recession or pace of the expected recovery is worse than expected, further meaningful provisions for credit losses could be required.\nOne of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL is the macro-economic forecasts from Moody's. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. Given the dynamic relationship between macro-economic variables within Customers' modelling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance. However, to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting applied to an adverse scenario. This scenario includes assumptions around new infections and COVID-19 deaths being significantly above the Baseline projections, leading to a much slower re-opening of the economy. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate remains elevated for a prolonged period and is estimated to remain at 9.0% and 9.1% at the end of 2021 and 2022, respectively. These numbers represent a 2.1% and 3.1% higher unemployment estimate than Baseline scenario projections of 6.9% and 6.0%, respectively for the same time periods. To demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters, management calculated the difference between a 100% baseline weighting and a 100% adverse scenario weighting for modeled results. This would result in an incremental quantitative allowance impact of approximately $60.8 million. This resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in ACL levels since (i) Customers uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its ACL process, (ii) the highly uncertain economic environment, (iii) the difficulty in predicting inter-relationships between macroeconomic variables used in various economic scenarios, and (iv) the sensitivity analysis does not account for any qualitative adjustments incorporated by Customers as part of its overall ACL framework.\nThere is no certainty that Customers' ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or Customers' markets, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of Customers' customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, Customers' net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on Customers' financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the current COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to negatively impact Customers' businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time.\nFor more information, see NOTE 7 - LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS AND LEASES to the audited financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of Customers Bancorp's consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements, including the accompanying notes. Please refer to Critical Accounting Policies in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION to Customers' audited financial statements for information concerning certain significant accounting policies and estimates applied in determining reported results of operations.\nThe following table sets forth the condensed statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nCustomers reported net income available to common shareholders of $118.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Factors contributing to the change in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows:\nNet interest income\nNet interest income increased $126.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as average interest-earning assets increased by $4.8 billion, partially offset by a 4 basis point decline in NIM to 2.71% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decline in NIM resulted from the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts of 225 basis points beginning in August 2019 and the shift in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities drove a 94 basis point decline in the yield on interest-earning assets and a 117 basis point decline in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The largest shift in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities was the origination of $5.0 billion (with $4.6 billion balance at December 31, 2020 and $3.1 billion average balance) in PPP loans yielding 2.10% and related PPPLF borrowings of $4.4 billion at December 31, 2020 ($2.5 billion average balance) costing 0.35%. Customers' total cost of funds, including non-interest bearing deposits, was 0.97% and 1.95% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProvision for credit losses on loans and leases\nThe $38.5 million increase in the provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, reflects Customers' adoption of CECL and the impact of COVID-19. Upon adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020, the ACL for loans and leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures increased by $79.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is presented within accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the related provision is presented as part of other non-interest expense on the consolidated income statement. The ACL on loans and leases held for investment, represented 1.90% of total loans and leases receivable, excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP measure, please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation within Loans and Leases, Credit Risk), at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.77% at December 31, 2019.\nNet charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $54.8 million, or 41 basis points of average total loans and leases, compared to $7.8 million, or eight basis points of average total loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily due to partial charge-offs of $25.2 million for two commercial real estate collateral dependent loans during the year ended December 31, 2020, and an increase in charge-offs of installment loans coinciding with the growth of the portfolio year-over-year.\nNon-interest income\nThe $20.8 million increase in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted primarily from $19.1 million in gains realized from the sale of AFS debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2020, $7.5 million loss on acquisition of interest-only GNMA securities during the year ended December 31, 2019, and increases of $6.1 million in commercial lease income, $4.4 million in mortgage warehouse transactional fees, $1.6 million in mortgage banking income,\nand $1.0 million in deposit fees. These increases were offset in part by decreases of $7.9 million in interchange and card revenue, $10.1 million in other non-interest income, and $0.8 million in gains on sale of SBA and other loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNon-interest expense\nThe $34.8 million increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from increases of $18.4 million in salaries and employee benefits, $9.4 million in technology, communication, and bank operations, $5.8 million in FDIC assessments, non-income taxes, and regulatory fees, $5.2 million in commercial lease depreciation, $2.0 million in merger and acquisition related expenses, $1.9 million in professional services, and $1.5 million in loan workout costs. These increases were offset in part by decreases of $4.4 million in provision for operating losses, $1.8 million in advertising and promotion, and $2.6 million in other non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome tax expense\nCustomers' effective tax rate was 24.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 22.3% for the year the ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the dilution of the permanent tax differences and other tax benefits as a result of increased pre-tax income.\nPreferred stock dividends\nPreferred stock dividends were $14.0 million and $14.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no changes to the amount of preferred stock outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. On June 15, 2020, the Series C preferred stock became floating at three-month LIBOR plus 5.30% compared to a fixed rate of 7.00%.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income (the difference between the interest earned on loans and leases, investments and interest-earning deposits with banks, and interest paid on deposits, borrowed funds and subordinated debt) is the primary source of Customers' earnings. The following table summarizes Customers' net interest income, related interest spread, net interest margin and the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Information is provided for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities with respect to (i) changes attributable to volume (i.e., changes in average balances multiplied by the prior-period average rate) and (ii) changes attributable to rate (i.e., changes in average rate multiplied by prior-period average balances). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\n\n(1)For presentation in this table, average balances and the corresponding average yields for investment securities are based upon historical cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.\n(2)Includes owner occupied commercial real estate loans.\n(3)Includes non-accrual loans, the effect of which is to reduce the yield earned on loans and leases, and deferred loan fees.\n(4)Total costs of deposits (including interest bearing and non-interest-bearing) were 0.89% and 1.76% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(5)Non-GAAP tax-equivalent basis, using an estimated marginal tax rate of 26% for both the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, presented to approximate interest income as a taxable asset. Management uses non-GAAP measures to present historical periods comparable to the current period presentation. In addition, management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers' financial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities. Please refer to the reconciliation schedule that follows this table.\n(6)Non-GAAP tax-equivalent basis, as described in note (5) for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, excluding net interest income from PPP loans and related borrowings, along with the related PPP loan balances and PPP fees receivable from interest-earning assets. Management uses non-GAAP measures to present historical periods comparable to the current period presentation. In addition, management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers' financial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities. Please refer to the reconciliation schedule that follows this table.\nNet interest income increased $126.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as average interest-earning assets increased by $4.8 billion primarily related to PPP loan originations, increases in installment loans, commercial loans to mortgage companies, commercial and industrial loans, investment securities, and interest earning deposits, partially\noffset by decreases in multi-family loans and residential mortgages. The overall average loans and leases receivable balance fluctuations were the result of Customers' strategic efforts to reduce the lower-yielding loans in the multi-family portfolio and replace them with higher-yielding commercial and industrial and installment loans.\nThe increase in average interest-earning assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was also offset partially by a 4 basis point decline in NIM to 2.71% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 2.75% for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting from the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts of 225 basis points beginning in August 2019 and the shift in the mix of interest-earning assets drove a 94 basis point decline in the yield on interest-earnings assets and an 117 basis point decline in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The largest shift in the mix of interest-earnings assets and interest-bearing liabilities was the origination of $4.6 billion ($3.1 billion average balance) in PPP loans yielding 2.10% and related PPPLF borrowings of $4.4 billion ($2.5 billion average balance) costing 0.35%. Customers' total cost of deposits, including interest-bearing and non-interest bearing) were 0.89% and 1.76% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCustomers' net interest margin tables contain non-GAAP financial measures which include net interest margin tax equivalent and net interest margin tax equivalent, excluding PPP loans. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to present the current period presentation to historical periods in prior filings. In addition, management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers' financial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities.\nA reconciliation of net interest margin tax equivalent and net interest margin tax equivalent, excluding PPP loans for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are set forth below.\n\nPROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nFor more information about the provision and Customers' ACL methodology and loss experience, see Critical Accounting Policies and Financial Condition - Loan and Leases, Credit Risk, and Asset Quality herein and NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION and NOTE 7 - LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES to Customers' audited financial statements.\nCustomers maintains an ACL to cover current expected credit losses as of the balance sheet date on loans and leases held for investment that are not reported at their fair value on a recurring basis. The ACL is increased through periodic provisions for credit losses on loans and leases that are charged as an expense on the consolidated statements of income and is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The loan and lease portfolio is reviewed quarterly to evaluate the performance of the portfolio and the adequacy of the ACL. The ACL is estimated as of the end of each quarter and compared to the balance recorded in the general ledger, net of charge-offs and recoveries. The allowance is adjusted to the estimated ACL balance with a corresponding charge (or debit) to the provision for credit losses on loans and leases.\nThe provision for credit losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the ACL at a level consistent with management's assessment of expected lifetime losses in the loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date. Customers recorded $62.8 million and a credit of $1.1 million of provision for credit losses for loans and leases and lending-related commitments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 utilizing the CECL methodology. The $38.5 million increase in the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects Customers' adoption of CECL, the impact of reserve build for the COVID-19 pandemic and the portfolio growth. Customers adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, the ACL for loans and leases and lending-related unfunded commitments increased by $79.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, with the after-tax cumulative effect recorded to retained earnings.\nNet charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $54.8 million, or 41 basis points of average total loans and leases, compared to $7.8 million, or 8 basis points of average total loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net charge-offs primarily relate to the partial charge-offs of two commercial real estate collateral dependent loans and charge-offs in consumer installment loans. The two commercial real estate collateral dependent loans were sold in August 2020 and January 2021.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nThe table below presents the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nInterchange and card revenue\nThe $7.9 million decrease in interchange and card revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from Customers becoming subject to the Federal Reserve's regulation limiting interchange fees for banks over $10 billion in assets beginning on July 1, 2020. The interchange and card revenue is expected to decrease in 2021 as a result of the divestiture of BMT to MFAC on January 4, 2021.\nDeposit fees\nThe $1.0 million increase in deposit fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from an increase in service charges on certain deposit accounts relating to a change in the fee structure at the BankMobile segment, partially offset by lower activity volume. The deposit fees are expected to decrease significantly in 2021 as a result of the divestiture of BMT to MFAC on January 4, 2021.\nCommercial lease income\nCommercial lease income represents income earned on commercial operating leases generated by Customers' Equipment Finance Group in which Customers is the lessor. The $6.1 million increase in commercial lease income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from the continued growth of Customers' equipment finance business.\nMortgage warehouse transactional fees\nThe $4.4 million increase in mortgage warehouse transactional fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from an increase in refinancing activity driven by the decline in market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. There can be no assurance that the refinancing activity will remain elevated for Customers to earn mortgage warehouse transactional fees in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nGain (loss) on sale of SBA and other loans\nThe $0.8 million decrease in gain (loss) on sale of SBA and other loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from a strategic initiative to retain SBA loans on our balance sheet for the first nine months of 2019. Customers resumed selling these loans in fourth quarter 2019 that generated higher gains as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nMortgage banking income\nThe $1.6", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with \"Business - Executive Summary\" and the Bancorp's consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020.\nOverview\nLike most financial institutions, Customers derives the majority of its income from interest it receives on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments. Customers' primary source of funds for making these loans and investments are its deposits and borrowings, on which it pays interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of Customers' success is the amount of its net interest income, or the difference between the income on its interest-earning assets and the expense on its interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, relative to the amount of average interest-earning assets, which is referred to as net interest margin.\nBankMobile, a division of Customers Bank, derived a majority of its revenue from interest income on installment loans, interchange and card revenue and deposit fees. On January 4, 2021, Customers Bancorp completed the divestiture of BankMobile Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Customers Bank and a component of BankMobile, through a merger with Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp. In connection with the closing of the divestiture, MFAC changed its name to BM Technologies, Inc.\u201d All of BankMobile's serviced deposits and loans including the related net interest income will remain with Customers Bank after the completion of the divestiture. Beginning in first quarter 2021, BMT's historical financial results for periods prior to the divestiture will be reflected in Customers Bancorp's results of operations as discontinued operations. Customers Bancorp's financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and the results of its operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included the assets and liabilities and financial results of BankMobile. As a result of the divestiture, Customers' interchange income, deposit account fees and subscription fees are expected to decrease. In addition, Customers' non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, technology, professional services, merger and acquisition related expenses and other non-interest expenses, including reimbursements from the white label relationship associated with BMT are expected to decrease. In connection with the divestiture, Customers has also entered into various agreements with BM Technologies, including a transition services agreement, software license agreement, deposit servicing agreement, non-competition agreement and loan agreement for periods ranging from one to ten years. Customers will continue to incur non-interest expenses associated with these agreements with BM Technologies in the future. See NOTE 26 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS to Customers Bancorp's audited financial statements for additional information.\nThere is credit risk inherent in all loans, so Customers maintains an ACL to absorb probable losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible. Customers maintains this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against its operating earnings. Customers has included a detailed discussion of this process, as well as several tables describing its ACL, in NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION and NOTE 7 - LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES to Customers' audited financial statements.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally, including the markets that Customers serves. Governmental responses during the pandemic have included orders closing businesses not deemed essential and directing individuals to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses that have led to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, material decreases in oil and gas prices and in business valuations, disrupted global supply chains, market downturns and volatility, changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears, related emergency response legislation and an expectation that Federal Reserve policy will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future.\nCustomers has taken deliberate actions to ensure that it has the necessary balance sheet strength to serve its clients and communities, including increases in liquidity and reserves supported by a strong capital position. Customers' business and consumer customers are experiencing varying degrees of financial distress, which is expected to continue in the coming months. In order to protect the health of its customers and team members, and to comply with applicable government directives, Customers has modified its business practices, including restricting team member travel, directing team members to work from home insofar as is possible and implementing its business continuity plans and protocols to the extent necessary. Customers also has made donations that have resulted in more than $1\nmillion, either directly or indirectly, to communities in its footprint for urgent basic needs and has been re-targeting existing sponsorship and grants to nonprofit organizations to support COVID-19 related activities.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. It contains substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes the SBA's PPP, a nearly $350 billion program designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans are intended to guarantee an eight-week or 24-week period of payroll and other costs to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to pay their bills. On April 16, 2020, the SBA announced that all available funds had been exhausted and applications were no longer being accepted. On April 22, 2020, an additional $310 billion of funds for the PPP was signed into law. On August 8, 2020, the SBA announced that the PPP was closed and no longer accepting PPP applications from participating lenders. However, on December 27, 2020, the CAA was signed into law, which provides $284 billion in additional funding for the SBA's PPP for small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CAA provides small businesses who received an initial PPP loan and experienced a 25% reduction in gross receipts to request a second PPP loan of up to $2.0 million. On January 11, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP program to small business and non-profit organizations that did not receive a loan through the initial PPP phase. As of December 31, 2020, Customers has helped thousands of small businesses by originating about $5.0 billion in PPP loans directly or through fintech partnerships. Customers also began accepting applications for the new round of PPP loans on January 11, 2021.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Customers has also implemented a loan modification program to provide temporary payment relief to certain of its borrowers who meet the program's qualifications. This program allows for a deferral of payments for a maximum of 90 days at a time. The deferred payments along with interest accrued during the deferral period are due and payable on the maturity date of the existing loan. As of December 31, 2020, total commercial deferments declined to $202.1 million, or 1.8% of total loans and leases, excluding PPP loans, from a peak of $1.2 billion earlier in 2020 and total consumer deferments declined to $16.4 million, or 0.1% of total loans and leases, excluding PPP loans. Excluding loans receivable, PPP from total loans and leases receivable is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers' financial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities.

For example, on March 15, 2020, the FRB reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 0.25% and announced that it would increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowing by 150 basis points while extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve requirements have been reduced to zero as of March 26, 2020. The FRB has also established, or has taken steps to establish, a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19, including among others, Main Street Lending facilities to purchase loan participations, under specified conditions, from banks lending to small and medium U.S. businesses and the PPPLF, which was created to bolster the effectiveness of the PPP by taking loans as collateral at face value. While Customers has not participated in all of these facilities or programs to date, it may participate in some or all of these facilities or programs, including as a lender, agent, or intermediary on behalf of clients or customers at various times in the future. As of December 31, 2020, Customers had $4.4 billion in borrowing from the PPPLF.\nSignificant uncertainties as to future economic conditions exist, and Customers has taken deliberate actions in response, including higher levels of on-balance sheet liquidity and maintaining strong capital ratios. Additionally, the economic pressures, coupled with the implementation of an expected lifetime loss methodology for determining our provision for credit losses as required by CECL have contributed to an increased provision for credit losses on loans and leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures in first quarter 2020. Customers continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 closely, as well as any effects that may result from the CARES Act and the CAA; however, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact Customers' operations and financial results during 2021 is highly uncertain.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information about the impact that recently adopted, including CECL, or issued accounting guidance will have on us, refer to NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION to Customers' audited financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCustomers has adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of U.S. GAAP and that are consistent with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Customers' significant accounting policies are described in NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION to Customers' audited financial statements.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by Customers that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets. Customers considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions management makes, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of Customers' assets.\nThe critical accounting policy that is both important to the portrayal of Customers' financial condition and results of operations and require complex, subjective judgments is the ACL. This critical accounting policy and material estimate, along with the related disclosures, are reviewed by Customers' Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nCustomers' ACL at December 31, 2020 represents Customers' current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from its loan and lease portfolio and its unfunded lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. Management estimates the ACL by projecting a lifetime loss rate conditional on a forecast of economic parameters and other qualitative adjustments, for the loans and leases' expected remaining term.\nCustomers uses external sources in the creation of its forecasts, including current economic conditions and forecasts for macroeconomic variables over its reasonable and supportable forecast period (e.g., GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, BBB spread, commercial real estate and home price index). After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, which ranges from two to five years, the models revert the forecasted macroeconomic variables to their historical long-term trends, without specific predictions for the economy, over the expected life of the pool, while also incorporating prepayment assumptions into its lifetime loss rates. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. Significant loan/borrower attributes utilized in the models include property type, initial loan to value, assigned risk ratings, delinquency status, origination date, maturity date, initial FICO scores, and borrower state.\nThe ACL may be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that Customers considers to reflect its current judgement of various events and risks that are not measured in our statistical procedures, including uncertainty related to the economic forecasts used in the modeled credit loss estimates, nature and volume of the loan and lease portfolio, credit underwriting policy exceptions, peer comparison, industry data, and model and data limitations. The qualitative allowance for economic forecast risk is further informed by multiple alternative scenarios to arrive at a composite scenario supporting the period-end ACL balance. The evaluation process is inherently imprecise and subjective as it requires significant management judgment based on underlying factors that are susceptible to changes, sometimes materially and rapidly. Customers recognizes that this approach may not be suitable in certain economic environments such that additional analysis may be performed at management's discretion. Due in part to its subjectivity, the qualitative evaluation may be materially impacted during periods of economic uncertainty and late breaking events that could lead to revision of reserves to reflect management's best estimate of expected credit losses.\nThe ACL is established in accordance with our ACL policy. The ACL Committee, which includes the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Risk Officer, and Chief Credit Officer, among others, reviews the adequacy of the ACL each quarter, together\nwith Customers' risk management team. The ACL policy, significant judgements and the related disclosures are reviewed by Customers' Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe increase in our estimated ACL as of December 31, 2020 as compared to our January 1, 2020 estimate was primarily attributable to the significant economic impact of COVID-19 and the related federal stimulus from the federal government, along with loan growth in Customers' commercial and consumer loan portfolios. The total reserve build for the ACL for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.9 million, for an ending balance of $146.5 million ($144.2 million for loans and leases and $2.3 million for unfunded lending-related commitments) as of December 31, 2020.\nTo determine the ACL as of December 31, 2020, Customers utilized the Moody's December 2020 Baseline forecast to generate its modelled expected losses and considered Moody's other alternative economic forecast scenarios to qualitatively adjust the modelled ACL by loan portfolio in order to reflect management's reasonable expectations of current and future economic conditions. The Baseline forecast at December 31, 2020 assumed continued improvement in forecasts of macroeconomic conditions compared to the previous earlier forecasts of macroeconomic conditions used by Customers during 2020; the Federal Reserve maintaining a target range for the fed funds rate at 0% to 0.25% until the second half of 2023; and an additional $908 billion of stimulus from the federal government. Customers continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related policy measures on the economy and, if the depth of the recession or pace of the expected recovery is worse than expected, further meaningful provisions for credit losses could be required.\nOne of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL is the macro-economic forecasts from Moody's. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. Given the dynamic relationship between macro-economic variables within Customers' modelling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance. However, to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting applied to an adverse scenario. This scenario includes assumptions around new infections and COVID-19 deaths being significantly above the Baseline projections, leading to a much slower re-opening of the economy. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate remains elevated for a prolonged period and is estimated to remain at 9.0% and 9.1% at the end of 2021 and 2022, respectively. These numbers represent a 2.1% and 3.1% higher unemployment estimate than Baseline scenario projections of 6.9% and 6.0%, respectively for the same time periods. To demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters, management calculated the difference between a 100% baseline weighting and a 100% adverse scenario weighting for modeled results. This would result in an incremental quantitative allowance impact of approximately $60.8 million. This resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in ACL levels since (i) Customers uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its ACL process, (ii) the highly uncertain economic environment, (iii) the difficulty in predicting inter-relationships between macroeconomic variables used in various economic scenarios, and (iv) the sensitivity analysis does not account for any qualitative adjustments incorporated by Customers as part of its overall ACL framework.\nThere is no certainty that Customers' ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or Customers' markets, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of Customers' customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, Customers' net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on Customers' financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the current COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to negatively impact Customers' businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time.\nFor more information, see NOTE 7 - LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS AND LEASES to the audited financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of Customers Bancorp's consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements, including the accompanying notes. Please refer to Critical Accounting Policies in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION to Customers' audited financial statements for information concerning certain significant accounting policies and estimates applied in determining reported results of operations.\nThe following table sets forth the condensed statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>403,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>277,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses on loans and leases </td> <td> </td> <td>62,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>101,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>266,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>231,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>175,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>43,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>132,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred stock dividends </td> <td> </td> <td>14,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(418) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income available to common shareholders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomers reported net income available to common shareholders of $118.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Factors contributing to the change in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows:\nNet interest income\nNet interest income increased $126.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as average interest-earning assets increased by $4.8 billion, partially offset by a 4 basis point decline in NIM to 2.71% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decline in NIM resulted from the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts of 225 basis points beginning in August 2019 and the shift in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities drove a 94 basis point decline in the yield on interest-earning assets and a 117 basis point decline in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The largest shift in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities was the origination of $5.0 billion (with $4.6 billion balance at December 31, 2020 and $3.1 billion average balance) in PPP loans yielding 2.10% and related PPPLF borrowings of $4.4 billion at December 31, 2020 ($2.5 billion average balance) costing 0.35%. Customers' total cost of funds, including non-interest bearing deposits, was 0.97% and 1.95% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProvision for credit losses on loans and leases\nThe $38.5 million increase in the provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, reflects Customers' adoption of CECL and the impact of COVID-19. Upon adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020, the ACL for loans and leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures increased by $79.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is presented within accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the related provision is presented as part of other non-interest expense on the consolidated income statement. The ACL on loans and leases held for investment, represented 1.90% of total loans and leases receivable, excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP measure, please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation within Loans and Leases, Credit Risk), at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.77% at December 31, 2019.\nNet charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $54.8 million, or 41 basis points of average total loans and leases, compared to $7.8 million, or eight basis points of average total loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily due to partial charge-offs of $25.2 million for two commercial real estate collateral dependent loans during the year ended December 31, 2020, and an increase in charge-offs of installment loans coinciding with the growth of the portfolio year-over-year.\nNon-interest income\nThe $20.8 million increase in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted primarily from $19.1 million in gains realized from the sale of AFS debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2020, $7.5 million loss on acquisition of interest-only GNMA securities during the year ended December 31, 2019, and increases of $6.1 million in commercial lease income, $4.4 million in mortgage warehouse transactional fees, $1.6 million in mortgage banking income,\nand $1.0 million in deposit fees. These increases were offset in part by decreases of $7.9 million in interchange and card revenue, $10.1 million in other non-interest income, and $0.8 million in gains on sale of SBA and other loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNon-interest expense\nThe $34.8 million increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from increases of $18.4 million in salaries and employee benefits, $9.4 million in technology, communication, and bank operations, $5.8 million in FDIC assessments, non-income taxes, and regulatory fees, $5.2 million in commercial lease depreciation, $2.0 million in merger and acquisition related expenses, $1.9 million in professional services, and $1.5 million in loan workout costs. These increases were offset in part by decreases of $4.4 million in provision for operating losses, $1.8 million in advertising and promotion, and $2.6 million in other non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome tax expense\nCustomers' effective tax rate was 24.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 22.3% for the year the ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the dilution of the permanent tax differences and other tax benefits as a result of increased pre-tax income.\nPreferred stock dividends\nPreferred stock dividends were $14.0 million and $14.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no changes to the amount of preferred stock outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. On June 15, 2020, the Series C preferred stock became floating at three-month LIBOR plus 5.30% compared to a fixed rate of 7.00%.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income (the difference between the interest earned on loans and leases, investments and interest-earning deposits with banks, and interest paid on deposits, borrowed funds and subordinated debt) is the primary source of Customers' earnings. The following table summarizes Customers' net interest income, related interest spread, net interest margin and the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Information is provided for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities with respect to (i) changes attributable to volume (i.e., changes in average balances multiplied by the prior-period average rate) and (ii) changes attributable to rate (i.e., changes in average rate multiplied by prior-period average balances). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\nTable

The overall average loans and leases receivable balance fluctuations were the result of Customers' strategic efforts to reduce the lower-yielding loans in the multi-family portfolio and replace them with higher-yielding commercial and industrial and installment loans.\nThe increase in average interest-earning assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was also offset partially by a 4 basis point decline in NIM to 2.71% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 2.75% for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting from the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts of 225 basis points beginning in August 2019 and the shift in the mix of interest-earning assets drove a 94 basis point decline in the yield on interest-earnings assets and an 117 basis point decline in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The largest shift in the mix of interest-earnings assets and interest-bearing liabilities was the origination of $4.6 billion ($3.1 billion average balance) in PPP loans yielding 2.10% and related PPPLF borrowings of $4.4 billion ($2.5 billion average balance) costing 0.35%. Customers' total cost of deposits, including interest-bearing and non-interest bearing) were 0.89% and 1.76% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCustomers' net interest margin tables contain non-GAAP financial measures which include net interest margin tax equivalent and net interest margin tax equivalent, excluding PPP loans.

These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities.\nA reconciliation of net interest margin tax equivalent and net interest margin tax equivalent, excluding PPP loans for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are set forth below.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income (GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>403,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>277,310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax-equivalent adjustment </td> <td>874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>735 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income tax equivalent (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>404,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>278,045 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable, PPP net interest income </td> <td>(54,583) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income tax equivalent, excluding PPP loans (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>278,045 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average total interest-earning assets (GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,933,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,123,708 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average PPP loans </td> <td>(3,121,157) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted average total interest-earning assets (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,812,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,123,708 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin (GAAP) </td> <td>2.70 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.74 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin tax equivalent (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>2.71 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin tax equivalent, excluding PPP loans (Non-GAAP) </td> <td>2.96 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nFor more information about the provision and Customers' ACL methodology and loss experience, see Critical Accounting Policies and Financial Condition - Loan and Leases, Credit Risk, and Asset Quality herein and NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION and NOTE 7 - LOANS AND LEASES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES to Customers' audited financial statements.\nCustomers maintains an ACL to cover current expected credit losses as of the balance sheet date on loans and leases held for investment that are not reported at their fair value on a recurring basis. The ACL is increased through periodic provisions for credit losses on loans and leases that are charged as an expense on the consolidated statements of income and is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The loan and lease portfolio is reviewed quarterly to evaluate the performance of the portfolio and the adequacy of the ACL. The ACL is estimated as of the end of each quarter and compared to the balance recorded in the general ledger, net of charge-offs and recoveries. The allowance is adjusted to the estimated ACL balance with a corresponding charge (or debit) to the provision for credit losses on loans and leases.\nThe provision for credit losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the ACL at a level consistent with management's assessment of expected lifetime losses in the loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date. Customers recorded $62.8 million and a credit of $1.1 million of provision for credit losses for loans and leases and lending-related commitments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 utilizing the CECL methodology. The $38.5 million increase in the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects Customers' adoption of CECL, the impact of reserve build for the COVID-19 pandemic and the portfolio growth. Customers adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, the ACL for loans and leases and lending-related unfunded commitments increased by $79.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, with the after-tax cumulative effect recorded to retained earnings.\nNet charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $54.8 million, or 41 basis points of average total loans and leases, compared to $7.8 million, or 8 basis points of average total loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net charge-offs primarily relate to the partial charge-offs of two commercial real estate collateral dependent loans and charge-offs in consumer installment loans. The two commercial real estate collateral dependent loans were sold in August 2020 and January 2021.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nThe table below presents the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interchange and card revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,902) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit fees </td> <td>13,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lease income </td> <td>18,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank-owned life insurance </td> <td>7,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(263) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage warehouse transactional fees </td> <td>11,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on sale of SBA and other loans </td> <td>2,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(761) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking income </td> <td>1,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,465.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss upon acquisition of interest-only GNMA securities </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,476) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on sale of investment securities </td> <td>20,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,905.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities </td> <td>1,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>4,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,121) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterchange and card revenue\nThe $7.9 million decrease in interchange and card revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from Customers becoming subject to the Federal Reserve's regulation limiting interchange fees for banks over $10 billion in assets beginning on July 1, 2020. The interchange and card revenue is expected to decrease in 2021 as a result of the divestiture of BMT to MFAC on January 4, 2021.\nDeposit fees\nThe $1.0 million increase in deposit fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from an increase in service charges on certain deposit accounts relating to a change in the fee structure at the BankMobile segment, partially offset by lower activity volume. The deposit fees are expected to decrease significantly in 2021 as a result of the divestiture of BMT to MFAC on January 4, 2021.\nCommercial lease income\nCommercial lease income represents income earned on commercial operating leases generated by Customers' Equipment Finance Group in which Customers is the lessor. The $6.1 million increase in commercial lease income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from the continued growth of Customers' equipment finance business.\nMortgage warehouse transactional fees\nThe $4.4 million increase in mortgage warehouse transactional fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from an increase in refinancing activity driven by the decline in market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. There can be no assurance that the refinancing activity will remain elevated for Customers to earn mortgage warehouse transactional fees in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nGain (loss) on sale of SBA and other loans\nThe $0.8 million decrease in gain (loss) on sale of SBA and other loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from a strategic initiative to retain SBA loans on our balance sheet for the first nine months of 2019. Customers resumed selling these loans in fourth quarter 2019 that generated higher gains as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nMortgage banking income\nThe $1.6"}
