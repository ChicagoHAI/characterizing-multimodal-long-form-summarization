Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to \"our partnership,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us,\" or like terms refer to Landmark Infrastructure Partners LP. The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial performance, financial condition and significant trends that may affect our future performance. You should read the following in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Among other things, those historical consolidated financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a growth-oriented partnership formed by Landmark Divided LLC ( Landmark\u201d or Sponsor\u201d) to acquire, develop, own and manage a portfolio of real property interests and infrastructure assets that are leased to companies in the wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising, and renewable power generation industries. In addition, the Partnership owns certain interests in receivables associated with similar assets. We generate revenue and cash flow from existing tenant leases of our real property interests and infrastructure assets to wireless carriers, cellular tower owners, outdoor advertisers, renewable power producers and colocation providers and other enterprises.\nThe Partnership is a master limited partnership organized in the State of Delaware and has been publicly traded since its initial public offering on November 19, 2014. On July 31, 2017, the Partnership completed changes to its organizational structure by transferring substantially all of its assets to a consolidated subsidiary, Landmark Infrastructure Inc., a Delaware corporation, which elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2017. We intend to continue to own and operate substantially all of our assets through the REIT Subsidiary. These changes are designed to simplify tax reporting for unitholders and broaden the Partnership's investor base by substantially eliminating unrelated business taxable income allocated by the Partnership to tax-exempt investors, including individuals investing through tax-deferred accounts such as an individual retirement account, and we do not intend to generate state source income.\nCOVID-19\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including how it will impact our tenants and business partners. While we did not incur significant disruptions during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties include the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and, as cases of COVID-19 have continued to be identified in additional countries, many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting the global economy. Further, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, consumer spending as well as other unanticipated consequences remain unknown.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our tenants and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. The current economic conditions, including the stay-at-home\u201d orders and similar mandates, have had and will likely continue to have a negative effect on the outdoor advertising industry. The Partnership has received and is currently reviewing a myriad of short-term rent relief requests from tenants within the outdoor advertising industry, most often in the form of rent deferral requests or amending to percentage rent. Not all tenant requests will ultimately result in modification agreements, nor is the Partnership forgoing its contractual rights under its lease agreements. The twelve months ended December 31, 2020 results may not be indicative of future results. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership generated $15.2 million in rental revenue from outdoor advertising tenants, $0.7 million of which was generated from percentage rent provisions.\nHow We Generate Rental Revenue\nWe primarily generate rental revenue and cash flow from existing leases of our tenant sites to wireless carriers, cellular tower owners, outdoor advertisers, renewable power producers and colocation providers and other enterprises. The amount of rental revenue generated by the assets in our portfolio depends principally on occupancy levels and the tenant lease rates and terms at our tenant sites.\nWe believe the terms of our tenant leases provide us with stable, predictable and growing cash flow. Substantially all of our tenant lease arrangements are triple net or effectively triple net, meaning that our tenants or the underlying property owners are generally contractually responsible for property-level operating expenses, including maintenance capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. For certain infrastructure assets, we incur ground rent obligations, maintenance expenditures, property taxes and insurance, some of which may be reimbursed by our tenants. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, 83% of our tenant leases (94% of rental revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2020) have contractual fixed-rate escalators or consumer price index ( CPI\u201d) -based rent escalators, and some of our tenant leases contain revenue-sharing provisions in addition to the base monthly or annual rental payments. Occupancy rates under our tenant leases have historically been very high. We also believe we are well positioned to negotiate higher rents in advance of lease expirations as tenants request lease amendments to accommodate equipment upgrades or add tenants to increase colocation.\nFuture economic or regional downturns affecting our submarkets that impair our ability to renew or re-lease our real property interests and other adverse developments that affect the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease obligations, such as tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our sites. Adverse developments or trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental revenue and tenant recoveries in future periods.\nSignificant consolidation among our tenants in the wireless communication industry (or our tenants' sub-lessees) may result in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites, because certain portions of these tenants' (or their sub-lessees') networks may be redundant. The loss of any one of our large customers as a result of joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions or other cooperative agreements may result in a material decrease in our revenue. On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint completed their merger. The Partnership does not expect the merger to have a material impact on rental revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, T-Mobile represented approximately 14% of rental revenue.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (1) occupancy and rental revenue; (2) operating and maintenance expenses; (3) FFO and AFFO; and (4) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nOccupancy and Rental Revenue\nThe amount of revenue we generate primarily depends on our occupancy rate. As of December 31, 2020, we had a 94% occupancy rate with 1,874 of our 1,986 available tenant sites leased. We believe the infrastructure assets at our tenant sites are essential to the ongoing operations and profitability of our tenants and will be a critical component for the rollout of future technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous vehicles. Combined with the challenges and costs of relocating the infrastructure, we believe that we will continue to enjoy high tenant retention and occupancy rates.\nThere has been consolidation in the wireless communication industry historically that has led to certain lease terminations. On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint completed their merger. The Partnership does not expect the merger to have a material impact on rental revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, T-Mobile represented approximately 14% of rental revenue. Additional consolidation among our tenants in the wireless communication industry (or our tenants' sub-lessees) may result in lease terminations for certain existing communication sites. Any additional termination of leases in our portfolio would result in lower rental revenue, may lead to impairment of our real property interests, or other adverse effects to our business.\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses\nSubstantially all of our tenant sites are subject to triple net or effectively triple net lease arrangements, which require the tenant or the underlying property owner to pay all utilities, property taxes, insurance and repair and maintenance costs. Our overall financial results could be impacted to the extent the owners of the fee interest in the real property or our tenants do not satisfy their obligations or to the extent a jurisdiction applies real property tax to our easements.\nFFO and AFFO\nFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents net income (loss) excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization expense, real estate related impairment charges, gains (or losses) on real estate transactions, adjustments for unconsolidated joint venture, and distributions to preferred unitholders and noncontrolling interests.\nFFO is generally considered by industry analysts to be the most appropriate measure of performance of real estate companies. FFO does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of the Partnership's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. The Partnership's computation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nAFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. AFFO adjusts FFO for certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with GAAP. AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net earnings, as an indication of the Partnership's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental measure of the Partnership's performance. The Partnership's computation of AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. We calculate AFFO by starting with FFO and adjusting for general and administrative expense reimbursement, acquisition-related expenses, unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives, straight line rent adjustments, unit-based compensation, amortization of deferred loan costs and discount on secured notes, deferred income tax expense, amortization of above and below market rents, loss on extinguishment of debt, repayments of receivables, adjustments for investment in unconsolidated joint venture, adjustments for drop-down assets and foreign currency transaction gain (loss). The GAAP measures most directly comparable to FFO and AFFO is net income.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and we define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before impairments, acquisition-related expenses, unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivatives, loss on extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on sale of real property interests, unit-based compensation, straight line rental adjustments, amortization of above- and below-market rents plus cash receipts applied toward the repayments of investments in receivable, the deemed capital contribution to fund our general and administrative expense reimbursement and adjustments for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. During the third quarter of 2019, we changed our definition of EBITDA to exclude adjustments for investments in unconsolidated joint venture to adhere to the definition of EBITDA as described in item 10(e)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-K. During the fourth quarter 2017, we changed our definition of Adjusted EBITDA by adding cash receipts applied toward the repayments of investments in receivables. We made this change to better reflect the quarterly amount of operating surplus as determined by our amended and restated partnership agreement. These changes did not have a material impact on our EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA and prior period amounts have been recasted to conform to current presentation.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded limited partnerships, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the viability of acquisitions and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Each of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. You should not consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. As a result, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nFor a further discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures of FFO, AFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA flow, and a reconciliation of FFO, AFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read Selected Historical Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results\nOur future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations for the reasons described below:\nCOVID-19\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate and development generally and those risks listed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, management and operation of our properties. However, due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, the Partnership's tenants and their operations may be impacted, including their ability to pay rent. The impact of COVID-19 on our future results could be significant and will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the success of actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19 and reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture\nOn September 24, 2018, the Partnership completed the formation of an unconsolidated joint venture (the JV\u201d). The Partnership contributed 545 tenant site assets to the unconsolidated JV that secured the Partnership's $125.4 million Series 2018-1 secured notes (the 2018 Securitization\u201d), in exchange for a 50.01% membership interest in the unconsolidated JV and $65.5 million in cash (the Transaction\u201d). The Partnership used $59.7 million of the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The Partnership deconsolidated the 545 tenant sites and real property interests and recognized a gain on contribution of real property interests of $100 million. The Partnership does not control the unconsolidated JV and therefore, accounts for its investment in the unconsolidated JV using the equity method of accounting prospectively upon formation of the unconsolidated JV.\nAcquisitions and Developments\nWe have in the past and intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of real property interests and developments of infrastructure. Our significant historical acquisition activity impacts the period to period comparability of our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Partnership completed one drop-down acquisition from our Sponsor and affiliates (collectively the Drop-down Acquisitions\u201d or Drop-down Assets\u201d). The Drop-down Assets acquired by the Partnership included an aggregate of 127 tenant sites for the year ended December 31, 2018 in exchange for total consideration of $59.9 million. The Drop-down Acquisitions are a transfer of net assets between entities under common control as the acquisitions do not meet the definition of a business in accordance with ASU No. 2017-01. The transfer of net assets is accounted for prospectively in the period in which the transfer occurs at the net carrying value. Any differences between the cash consideration and the net carrying value of the transfer of net assets have been allocated to the General Partner.\nAdditionally, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Partnership acquired 15 tenant sites, 146 tenant sites and 104 tenant sites from third parties for a total consideration of $144.2 million, $52.0 million and $75.8 million, respectively. See Note 3, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2020, we focused on the acquisition of multiple data center properties with long-term triple net leases totaling $142.8 million.\nSales\nThe Partnership's sales of real property interests impacts the period to period comparability of our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership completed the sale of its interest in the consolidated joint venture that holds its European outdoor advertising portfolio and recognized a gain on sale of real property interest of $15.5 million. The operating results of the European outdoor advertising portfolio and the related gain on sale are presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, for all prior periods presented, the related assets and liabilities are presented as assets and liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. The Partnership used proceeds from the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio and available cash to repay borrowings totaling $115 million on its revolving credit facility, including the \u00a340.5 million of British pound sterling ( GBP\u201d) denominated borrowings, and terminate USD interest rate swaps with a notional value of $145 million and a GBP denominated interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of \u00a338 million for approximately $7.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Partnership completed sales of its real property interests and investments in receivables for total consideration of $46.4 million and recognized a gain on sale of $18.0 million.\nSecured Notes\nOn January 15, 2020, certain subsidiaries of the Partnership entered into a master note purchase and participation agreement ( MNPPA\u201d) pursuant to which such subsidiaries issued and sold an initial $170 million aggregate principal amount of 3.90% series A senior secured notes in a private placement (the 2019 Secured Notes\u201d). The 2019 Secured Notes mature on January 14, 2027 and include an interest-only initial term of three years. The net proceeds were used to repay in full the 2016 Secured Notes by $108 million and the revolving credit facility by $59 million. In connection with the issuance of the senior secured notes, the Partnership obtained a standby letter of credit arrangement totaling $3.4 million.\nOn June 6, 2018, the Partnership completed the 2018 Securitization involving a segregated pool of wireless communication sites and related property interests owned by certain special purpose subsidiaries of the Partnership, through the issuance of the 2018-1 Secured Tenant Site Contract Revenue Notes, Class C, Class D and Class F (the 2018 Secured Notes\u201d), in an aggregate principal amount of $125.4 million. The Class C, Class D and Class F 2018 Secured Notes bear interest at a fixed note rate per annum of 3.97%, 4.70% and 5.92%, respectively. On September 24, 2018, the Partnership completed the formation of an unconsolidated joint venture by contributing certain special purpose subsidiaries to the unconsolidated joint venture, including the 2018 Secured Notes. See Note 8, Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture and Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOn April 24, 2018, a special purpose subsidiary of the Partnership entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which such subsidiary agreed to sell approximately $43.7 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.38% senior secured notes in a private placement (the 4.38% Senior Secured Notes\u201d). The 4.38% Senior Secured Notes are fully amortizing through June 30, 2036. The 4.38% Senior Secured Notes are secured by a segregated pool of renewable power generation sites and related property interests owned directly or indirectly by such subsidiary.\nThe secured notes described above are collectively referred to as the Secured Notes.\u201d See Note 9, Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn November 15, 2018, the Partnership completed its Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility and obtained commitments from a syndicate of banks with initial borrowing commitments of $450.0 million for five-years. Additionally, borrowings up to $75.0 million may be denominated in GBP, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. Loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR related to the currency for which borrowings are denominated, plus a spread ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% (determined based on leverage levels). As of December 31, 2020, the applicable spread was 2.25%. Additionally, under the revolving credit facility we will be subject to an annual commitment fee (determined based on leverage levels) associated with the available undrawn capacity subject to certain restrictions. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable annual commitment rate used was 0.20%.\nSeries C Preferred Units\nOn April 2, 2018, the Partnership completed a public offering of 2,000,000 Series C Floating-to-Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Redeemable Convertible Preferred Units ( Series C Preferred Units\u201d), representing limited partner interest in the Partnership, at a price of $25.00 per unit. We received net proceeds of approximately $47.5 million after deducting underwriters' discounts and offering expenses paid by us of $2.5 million. We used substantially all net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nHolders of Series C Preferred Units, at their option, may, at any time and from time to time, convert some or all of their Series C Preferred Units based on an initial conversion rate of 1.3017 common units per Series C Preferred Unit. In the event of a fundamental change, holder of the Series C Preferred Units, at their option, may convert some or all of their Series C Preferred Units into the greater of (i) a number of common units plus a make-whole premium and (ii) a number of common units equal to the lessor of (a) the liquidation preference divided by the market value of our common units on the effective date of such fundamental change and (b) 11.13 (subject to adjustments). On May 15, 2025, May 15, 2028, and each subsequent five-year anniversary date thereafter (each such date, a designated redemption date\u201d), each holder of Series C Preferred Units shall have the right (a redemption right\u201d) to require the Partnership to redeem any or all of the Series C Preferred Units held by such holder outstanding on such designated redemption date at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference of $25.00, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to, but not including, in each case out of funds legally available for such payment and to the extent not prohibited by law, the designated redemption date (the put redemption price\u201d). At our option we may pay the redemption in our common units or cash, subject to certain limitations.\nAt any time on or after May 20, 2025, the Partnership shall have the option to redeem the Series C Preferred Units, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of $25.00 per Series C Preferred Unit plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to the date of redemption, whether or not declared. See Note 12, Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nHistorically we have hedged a portion of the variable interest rates under our secured debt facilities through interest rate swap agreements. We have not applied hedge accounting to these derivative financial instruments which has resulted in the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements to be reflected in income as either a realized or unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives, except for foreign currency changes on interest rate swaps denominated in a foreign currency. In connection with the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio, the Partnership used proceeds from the sale to terminate existing USD interest rate swaps with a notional value of $145 million and a GBP denominated interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of \u00a338 million for approximately $7.6 million. On September 29, 2020, the Partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $60 million with a fixed rate at 0.18% per annum and a maturity date of November 15, 2023. On December 30, 2020, the Partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $40 million with a fixed rate at 0.21% per annum and a maturity date of November 15, 2023.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nUnder the Partnership's Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Landmark Infrastructure Partners LP dated April 2, 2018 (the Amended Partnership Agreement\u201d), we are required to reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all costs and expenses that they incur on our behalf for managing and controlling our business and operations. Except to the extent specified under our amended Omnibus Agreement with Landmark (the Omnibus Agreement\u201d), which was amended on January 30, 2019, our general partner determines the amount of these expenses and such determinations must be made in good faith under the terms of the Partnership Agreement. Under the Omnibus Agreement, we agreed to reimburse Landmark for expenses related to certain general and administrative services that Landmark will provide to us in support of our business, subject to a quarterly cap equal to 3% of our revenue during the current calendar quarter. This cap on expenses will last until the earlier to occur of: (i) the date on which our revenue for the immediately preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeded $120 million and (ii) November 19, 2021. The full amount of our general and administrative expenses incurred will be reflected on our income statements, and to the extent such general and administrative expenses exceed the cap amount, the amount of such excess will be reflected in our financial statements as a capital contribution from Landmark rather than as a reduction of our general and administrative expenses, except for expenses that would otherwise be allocated to us, which are not included in the amount of general and administrative expenses.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nCOVID-19\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate and development generally and those risks listed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, management and operation of our properties. However, due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, the Partnership's tenants and their operations may be impacted, including their ability to pay rent. The impact of COVID-19 on our future results could be significant and will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the success of actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19 and reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets.\nAcquisitions and Developments\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of real property interests from third parties and developments of infrastructure, utilizing the expertise of our management and other Landmark employees to identify and assess potential acquisitions, for which we may pay Landmark mutually agreed reasonable fees. When acquiring real property interests, we will target infrastructure locations that are essential to the ongoing operations and profitability of our tenants, which we expect will result in continued high tenant occupancy and enhance our cash flow stability. For our digital infrastructure industry, we focus on acquiring mission-critical, high-quality, network-neutral, single and multi-tenant data centers, primarily supporting colocation/cloud, wholesale colocation and enterprise tenants, in strategic markets. We expect the data center assets to have high-quality anchor tenants in place for whom the data center is critically important for its continued operations as well as leases that are structured on a long-term, net basis and contain contractual rent escalators. Additionally, we will focus on infrastructure locations with characteristics that are difficult to replicate in their respective markets, and those with tenant assets that cannot be easily moved to nearby alternative sites or replaced by new construction. Although our initial portfolio is focused on wireless communication, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation assets in the United States, we intend to grow our initial portfolio of real property interests into other fragmented infrastructure asset classes and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions internationally. The impact of COVID-19 may restrict access to construction materials and delay development projects.\nDuring 2017, the Partnership started developing an ecosystem of technologies that provides smart enabled infrastructure including stealth towers and digital outdoor advertising kiosks across North America. Stealth towers are self-contained, neutral-host towers designed for wireless carrier and other wireless operator collocation. The stealth towers are designed for macro, mini macro and small cell deployments and will support Internet of Things (IoT), carrier densification needs, private LTE networks and other wireless solutions.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Partnership entered into an agreement with DART to develop a smart media and communications platform which will include the deployment of content-rich kiosks and the Partnership's smart enabled infrastructure ecosystem solution on strategic high-traffic DART locations.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership deployed two stealth towers, 112 DART kiosks and placed in service other assets for a total of $16.2 million. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Partnership deployed nine and four infrastructure sites totaling $1.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. As we deploy these infrastructure assets, we may incur additional operating expenses associated with ground lease payments and other operating expenses to maintain our infrastructure assets. Additionally, the Partnership may pursue further development opportunities in the future. The impact of COVID-19 has at times limited access to construction materials and delayed development projects and may continue to impact the pace of developments.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture\nOn September 24, 2018, the Partnership completed the formation of the unconsolidated JV. The Partnership contributed 545 tenant site assets to the unconsolidated JV that secured the Partnership's 2018 Securitization in exchange for a 50.01% membership interest in the unconsolidated JV and $65.5 million in cash. The Partnership does not control the unconsolidated JV and therefore, accounts for its investment in the unconsolidated JV using the equity method of accounting prospectively upon formation of the unconsolidated JV.\nSales\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership completed the sale of its interest in the consolidated joint venture that holds its European outdoor advertising portfolio and recognized a gain on sale of real property interest of $15.5 million in discontinued operations. The Partnership used proceeds from the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio and available cash to repay borrowings totaling $115 million on its revolving credit facility, including the \u00a340.5 million of GBP denominated borrowings, and terminate USD interest rate swaps with a notional value of $145 million and a GBP denominated interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of \u00a338 million for approximately $7.6 million.\nMergers\nSignificant consolidation among our tenants in the wireless communication industry (or our tenants' sub-lessees) may result in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites, because certain portions of these tenants' (or their sub-lessees') networks may be redundant. The loss of any one of our large customers as a result of joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions or other cooperative agreements may result in a material decrease in our revenue. On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint completed their merger. For the year ended December 31, 2020, T-Mobile represented approximately 14% of rental revenue.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn November 15, 2018, the Partnership completed its Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility and obtained commitments from a syndicate of banks with initial borrowing commitments of $450.0 million for five-years. Additionally, borrowings up to $75.0 million may be denominated in GBP, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. As of November 1, 2019, the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility denominated in GBP was \u00a340.5 million. Loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR, plus a spread ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% (determined based on leverage levels). As of December 31, 2020, the applicable spread was 2.25%. Additionally, under the revolving credit facility we will be subject to an annual commitment fee (determined based on leverage levels) associated with the available undrawn capacity subject to certain restrictions. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable annual commitment rate used was 0.20%.\nSecured Notes\nOn January 15, 2020, certain subsidiaries of the Partnership entered into a MNPPA pursuant to which such subsidiaries issued and sold an initial $170 million aggregate principal amount of 3.90% series A senior secured notes in a private placement. The senior secured notes mature on January 14, 2027 and include an interest-only initial term of three years. The net proceeds were used to repay in full the 2016 Secured Notes by $108 million and the revolving credit facility by $59 million. In connection with the issuance of the senior secured notes, the Partnership obtained a standby letter of credit arrangement totaling $3.4 million.\nChanging Interest Rates and Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nInterest rates have been at or near historic lows in recent years. If interest rates rise, this may impact the availability and terms of debt financing, our interest expense associated with existing and future debt or our ability to make accretive acquisitions. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currencies in which the Partnership operates may impact the availability and terms of debt financing, our interest expense associated with existing and future debt or our ability to make accretive acquisitions.\nLIBOR Phase Out\nIn July 2017, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the ARRC which identified the SOFR as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. The Partnership is not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets. Any changes adopted by FCA or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR. If that were to occur, our interest payments could change. In addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in its current form.\nThe Partnership has agreements that are indexed to LIBOR and is monitoring and evaluating the related risks, which include interest on loans and valuation of derivative instruments. These risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to a new alternative rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur. The value of loans or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued. For some instruments, the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging, as they may require negotiation with the respective counterparty.\nIf a contract is not transitioned to an alternative rate and LIBOR is discontinued, the impact on our contracts is likely to vary by contract. If LIBOR is discontinued or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected.\nWhile we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point. This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. Our revolving credit facility contains fallback language generally consistent with the ARRC's amendment approach, which provides a streamlined amendment approach for negotiating a benchmark replacement and introduces clarity with respect to the fallback trigger events and an adjustment to be applied to the successor rate. We continue to monitor developments by the ARRC and the potential impact of LIBOR changes on our business.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following discussion of critical accounting policies uses we\u201d, our\u201d and the Partnership\u201d interchangeably. Our discussion and analysis of the historical financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We have provided a summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership, included elsewhere in Part IV, Item 15(a)(1). We have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial condition and results of operations. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those of other companies.\nA critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. Generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by the users of our financial statements in their evaluation of our performance. Of the accounting policies discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership, included in Part IV, Item 15(a)(1), the accounting policies presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies.\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisitions\nThe Partnership applies the asset acquisition method to all acquired investments of real property interests for transactions that meet the definition of an asset acquisition. The purchase consideration of the real property interests is allocated to the acquired tangible asset, such as land and building, and the identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of perpetual and limited life easements, above-market and below-market leases and in-place leases, based in each case on their fair values. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using the discounted cash flow valuation method. In certain instances, such as data center acquisitions, the sales comparison approach is used to determine the fair value of the land assets, the cost approach to determine the fair value of the building and site improvements, and the income approach to determine the fair value of the real property interest and liability assumed. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, the Partnership estimates the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future cash flows. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized.\nFactors considered in estimating the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired include information obtained about each asset as a result of Landmark's pre-acquisition due diligence and its marketing and leasing activities. In order to calculate the estimated in-place lease value, we employed the income approach in accordance with ASC 805 by multiplying the anticipated market absorption period by the market rent at the time of acquisition for each in-place lease agreement. Based on our experience in the industry, we have determined a range of lease execution timelines to be between one and twelve months. For the in-place lease valuation, we consider a lease-up period of four to eight months to be representative of the market.\nWe estimated the fair value of real property interests using the income approach. The discount rates used ranged from 6% to 20% with a weighted average discount rate of 8.5%. In certain instances, such as data center acquisitions, the sales comparison approach is used to determine the fair value of the land assets, the cost approach to determine the fair value of the building and site improvements, and the income approach to\ndetermine the fair value of the real property interest and liability assumed. The value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in-place tenant lease value for the real estate acquired as such value and its consequence to amortization expense is materially consistent with the in-place lease value for these particular acquisitions. Should future acquisitions of real property interests result in allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships, an amount would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationship. The value of in-place leases and customer relationship is amortized to expense over the estimated period the tenant is expected to be leasing the site under the existing terms which typically range from 2 to 20 years. If a tenant lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be impaired.\nThe discount rate associated with each asset varies based on the location of an asset (including demographics and zoning restrictions), and other asset specific characteristics. Market rent for each asset is determined based on location of each asset, asset type, zoning restrictions, ground space necessary for the tenant's equipment, remaining site capacity, visibility (specifically for billboards), and nearby sites.\nIn allocating the purchase consideration of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired asset, above-market, below-market and in-place lease values are calculated based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over the estimated period the tenant is expected to be leasing the site under the above or below-market terms. The capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as a decrease or increase, respectively, to rental income over the estimated period the tenant is expected to be leasing the site. Wireless communication and outdoor advertising tenant leases obtained by us through acquisition of real property interests are generally cancellable, upon 30 to 180 days' notice by the tenants, with no significant penalty. Digital infrastructure and renewable power generation tenant leases are generally non-cancellable. With respect to below-market leases, consideration is given to any below-market renewal periods. However, for wireless communication assets, we estimated the above- or below-market lease value over an analysis period of the earlier of the lease expiration or 10 years based on estimated useful life of the underlying equipment and assets. For outdoor advertising assets, we estimated the above- or below-market lease value over an analysis period of the earlier of the lease expiration or 20 years, based on a longer estimated useful life of 20 years for outdoor advertising assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Development Projects\nWe assess the carrying values of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future net cash flow, undiscounted and without interest, expected to be generated by the asset.\nIn evaluating our assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change, as well as other factors. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including the income approach using a market discount rate, terminal capitalization rate and rental rate assumptions, or on the sales comparison approach to similar assets. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flow, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our assets that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairments of our assets.\nDevelopment projects and other similar contracts are also assessed to determine whether it continues to meet our investment return standards. Assessments are made separately for each project on a quarterly basis and are affected by the following factors relative to the market in which the asset is located, among others: estimated development and construction costs and projected profitability. When a decision is made to cease construction on certain projects due to market conditions and/or fluctuations in our development strategy, we write off the related capitalized costs, including pre-construction costs. Based on the results of our assessments, there were no construction in progress impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized impairment charges related to certain construction in progress of $1.6 million and included in impairment in our consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Partnership recognizes rental income under operating leases, including rental abatements, lease incentives and contractual fixed increases, if any, from tenants under lease arrangements with minimum fixed and determinable increases on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the related leases when collectability is reasonably assured. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are recorded as deferred rent assets. The excess of rent payments collected over amounts recognized contractually due pursuant to the underlying lease are recorded as prepaid rents. The Partnership accounts for and presents tenant reimbursements as a component of rental revenue in our consolidated income statements in accordance with the new lease standard ( ASC 842\u201d). Tenant reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant's obligation to reimburse us arises.\nLeases obtained by the Partnership through its acquisition and ownership of real property interests are generally cancelable upon 30-180 days' notice by the tenants with no significant penalty. The Partnership evaluates whether the lease arrangements economically compel the tenant to not cancel the lease in determining the term of the lease by considering various factors such as cancellation rights, availability of alternative sites, and historical cancellation rates. For cancellable leases where the tenant is not economically compelled to continue the lease, the term of the lease is considered to be the non-cancellable period with rental abatements and contractual fixed rate increases recorded in the period the amounts become due and payable. Leases obtained through development projects, are generally non-cancellable for the initial term.\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Wireless Communication - As a result of various factors, including the cancellation rights, ability to find alternative sites, credit risk, and historical cancellation and lease amendment rates, the lease term is generally considered to be the non-cancellable term of the lease of 30 to 180 days. For these leases, rental abatements and contractual fixed increases are recorded in the period the amounts become due and payable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Digital Infrastructure - The lease term is generally non-cancellable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Outdoor Advertising and Renewable Power Generation - The lease term is generally considered to be the non-cancellable term of the remaining portion of the existing term of the lease.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as a decrease or increase, respectively, to rental income over the estimated period the tenant is expected to be leasing the site.\nOur ability to accurately estimate the term of our tenant leases is critical to the amount of revenue we recognize.\nResults of Operations of our Partnership\nSegments\nIn connection with the sale of our European outdoor advertising portfolio, an evaluation of segment reporting thresholds resulted in changes in our segment presentation for all prior periods presented. As of June 30, 2020, we conduct business through four reportable business segments: Wireless Communication, Digital Infrastructure, Outdoor Advertising and Renewable Power Generation. Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are commonly managed, as all four businesses require similar marketing and business strategies. We evaluate our segments based on revenue because substantially all of our tenant lease arrangements are triple net or effectively triple net. We believe this measure provides investors relevant and useful information because it is presented on an unlevered basis.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations for all periods presented were affected by the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio on June 17, 2020, other asset sales in 2019, formation of the unconsolidated JV on September 24, 2018, and acquisitions made during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 1,986 and 2,025 available tenant sites, respectively.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2020 to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table

primarily due to $3.6 million increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 attributable to digital infrastructure acquisitions in 2020 and $1.8 million increase attributable to the full year of rental revenue in 2020 for tenant sites acquired during 2019, offset by $0.3 million of decline in outdoor advertising rental revenue. Revenue generated in 2020 from our wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation segments was $25.7 million, $9.9, million, $15.2 million and $8.1 million or 43%, 17%, 26% and 14% of total rental revenue, respectively, compared to $25.5 million, $4.2 million, $15.5 million and $8.5 million or 47%, 8%, 29% and 16% of total rental revenue, respectively, during 2019. The occupancy rates in our wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation segments were 92%, 100%, 96% and 100%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 compared to 93%, 100%, 97% and 100%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, our effective monthly rental rates per tenant site for wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation segments were $2,013, $82,006, $1,907 and $9,611, respectively, during 2020 compared to $1,953, $62,761, $1,953 and $9,214, respectively, during 2019.\nProperty Operating\nProperty operating expenses increased $0.4 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in rent expense on assets subject to a ground lease payment. Substantially all of our tenant sites are leased to tenants under triple net or effectively triple net lease arrangements, which require the tenant or the underlying property owner to pay all utilities, property taxes, insurance and repair and maintenance costs. As we deploy our smart enabled infrastructure solutions and other projects, we may incur additional operating expenses associated with ground lease payments and other operating expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $0.5 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in legal related expenses. Under our Amended Partnership Agreement, we are required to reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all costs and expenses that they incur on our behalf for managing and controlling our business and operations. Except to the extent specified under our Omnibus Agreement, our general partner determines the amount of these expenses and such determinations must be made in good faith under the terms of the Amended Partnership Agreement. On January 30, 2019, we amended the Omnibus Agreement and agreed to reimburse Landmark for expenses related to certain general and administrative services that Landmark will provide to us in support of our business, subject to a quarterly cap equal to 3% of our revenue during the current calendar quarter. Under the amended Omnibus Agreement, this cap on expenses will last until the earlier to occur of: (i) the date on which our revenue for the immediately preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeded $120 million and (ii) November 19, 2021. The full amount of general and administrative expenses incurred is reflected on our income statements and the amount in excess of the cap that is reimbursed is reflected on our financial statements as a capital contribution from Sponsor rather than as a reduction of our general and administrative expenses, except for expenses that would otherwise be allocated to us, which are not included in the amount of general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Landmark reimbursed us $3.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, for expenses related to certain general and administrative expenses that exceeded the cap. Included in the total general and expenses reimbursement from Sponsor is $0.3 million, respectively, of management fees related to our unconsolidated joint venture that is not subject to the cap and is treated as a capital contribution from Sponsor. Additionally, indemnification of $0.4 million related to property taxes is included in capital contributions from Sponsor on the Consolidated Statements of Equity and Mezzanine Equity for 2019.\nAcquisition-Related\nAcquisition-related expenses are third party fees and expenses related to acquiring an asset and include survey, title, legal and other items as well as legal and financial advisor expenses associated with business acquisitions or unsuccessful asset acquisitions.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $3.0 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of acquisitions and the deployment of two stealth towers, 112 DART kiosks and other assets placed in service in 2020.\nImpairments\nImpairments decreased $2.0 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to five lease terminations and one non-lease renewal in our wireless and outdoor advertising segments for $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to impairment charges related to certain construction in progress contracts and eight lease terminations in our wireless communication and outdoor advertising segments for $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest and Other Income\nInterest and other income decreased $0.1 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of the sale of investments in receivables during the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income on receivables is generated from our wireless communication, outdoor advertising, and renewable power generation segments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $0.2 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower interest rates during 2020 compared to 2019.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2019 Secured Notes, the Partnership repaid in full the 2016 Secured Notes by $108 million. The unamortized balance of the deferred loan costs totaling $1.2 million and a $1.0 million make-whole payment were recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nUnrealized Loss on Derivatives\nWe mitigated exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on existing variable rate debt by entering into swap contracts that fixed the floating LIBOR rate. These interest rate swap agreements extend through and beyond the term of the Partnership's existing credit facility. The swap contracts were adjusted to fair value at each period end. The unrealized loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 and unrealized loss for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflects the change in fair value of these contracts during those periods. In connection with the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio, the Partnership used proceeds from the sale to terminate existing swaps including the GBP interest rate swap agreement for a total of approximately $7.6 million.\nEquity Income from Unconsolidated Joint Venture\nEquity income from unconsolidated joint venture increased $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at fair value and subsequently adjusted for additional distributions and the Partnership's proportionate share of equity in the JV's income. The Partnership recognizes its proportionate share of the ongoing income or loss of the unconsolidated JV as equity income from unconsolidated JV on the consolidated statements of operations.\nGain on Sale of Real Property Interests\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Partnership recognized gain on sale of real property interests of $18.0 million related to\nthe sale of real property interests to third parties during the year ended December 31, 2019. There was no gain on sale of real property interests recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership recorded a net tax benefit of $0.4 million as a result of an increase to deferred tax assets related to a higher US state effective tax rate and generated net operating losses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Partnership recorded a gain on sale of assets in our taxable subsidiary of $11.7 million, resulting in a $3.0 million income tax expense related to the gain.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nOn June 17, 2020, the Partnership sold its European outdoor advertising portfolio for a purchase price of \u00a395 million and recognized a total gain on sale of $15.5 million. The sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio met the criteria as discontinued operations in June 2020. As a result, we reclassified the operating results of the European outdoor advertising portfolio and gain on sale to discontinued operations and excluded these amounts from income from continuing operations for all periods presented on the consolidated statements of operations.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2019 to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table summarizes the

property interests. Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes $10.0 million of rental revenue generated from the assets contributed to the JV prior to the date of the transaction and $2.0 million of rental revenue generated from assets sold in 2019. The decrease in rental revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 was offset by $2.7 million increase in rental revenue as a result of lease amendments and contractual lease escalators in 2019, as well as $0.8 million of rental revenue attributed to assets acquired in 2019 and $0.8 million of rental revenue due to the full year of rental revenue in 2019 for tenant sites acquired during 2018. On September 24, 2018, the Partnership completed the formation of the unconsolidated JV. The Partnership contributed 545 wireless communication assets to the JV along with the associated liabilities. The Partnership does not control the unconsolidated JV and therefore, accounts for its investment in the unconsolidated JV using the equity method of accounting prospectively upon formation of the unconsolidated JV. Revenue generated in 2019 from our wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation segments was $25.5 million, $4.2 million, $15.5 million and $8.5 million or 47%, 8%, 29% and 16% of total rental revenue, respectively, compared to $34.6 million, $3.3 million, $15.5 million and $8.1 million, or 57%, 5%, 25% and 13% of total rental revenue, respectively, during 2018. The occupancy rates in our wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation segments were 93%, 100%, 97% and 100% respectively, as of December 31, 2019 compared to 94%, 100%, 98% and 100%, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, our effective monthly rental rates per tenant site for wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation segments were $1,953, $62,761, $1,953 and $9,214, respectively, during 2019 compared to $1,926, $53,301, $2,118 and $9,148, respectively, during 2018.\nProperty Operating\nProperty operating expenses increased $0.6 million during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in fee simple properties and rent expense on assets subject to a ground lease payment. Substantially all of our tenant sites are leased to tenants under triple net or effectively triple net lease arrangements, which require the tenant or the underlying property owner to pay all utilities, property taxes, insurance and repair and maintenance costs. As we deploy our smart enabled infrastructure solution and other projects, we may incur additional operating expenses associated with ground lease payments and other operating expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due an increase in accounting and legal related expenses. Under our Amended Partnership Agreement, we are required to reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all costs and expenses that they incur on our behalf for managing and controlling our business and operations. Except to the extent specified under our Omnibus Agreement, our general partner determines the amount of these expenses and such determinations must be made in good faith under the terms of the Amended Partnership Agreement. On January 30, 2019, we amended the Omnibus Agreement and agreed to reimburse Landmark for expenses related to certain general and administrative services that Landmark will provide to us in support of our business, subject to a quarterly cap equal to 3% of our revenue during the current calendar quarter. Under the amended Omnibus Agreement, this cap on expenses will last until the earlier to occur of: (i) the date on which our revenue for the immediately preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeded $120 million and (ii) November 19, 2021. The full amount of general and administrative expenses incurred is reflected on our income statements and the amount in excess of the cap that is reimbursed is reflected on our financial statements as a capital contribution from Sponsor rather than as a reduction of our general and administrative expenses, except for expenses that would otherwise be allocated to us, which are not included in the amount of general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Landmark reimbursed us $3.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for expenses related to certain general and administrative expenses that exceeded the cap. Included in the total general and expenses reimbursement from Sponsor is $0.3 million of management fees related to our unconsolidated joint venture that is not subject to the cap and is treated as a capital contribution from Sponsor. Additionally, indemnification of $0.4 million related to property taxes is included in capital contributions from Sponsor on the Consolidated Statements of Equity and Mezzanine Equity for 2019.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.3 million during 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of having a greater number of average tenant sites during 2018 compared to 2019. Amortization of investments in real property rights with finite useful lives and in-place lease values to decreased as a result of contributing assets to the unconsolidated JV. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $2.6 million of amortization expense generated from the JV assets during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nImpairments\nImpairments increased $0.7 million during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to impairment charges related to certain construction in progress contracts and eight lease terminations in our wireless communication and outdoor advertising segments for $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to impairment charges related to 16 investments in receivables in our wireless communication segment and six lease termination in our wireless communication and outdoor advertising segments for $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Landmark indemnified the Partnership for the $1.0 million impairment of investments in receivables and certain real property interests which is reflected as a deemed capital contribution.\nInterest and Other Income\nInterest and other income decreased $0.8 million during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of the sale of investments in receivables during the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income on receivables is generated from our wireless communication, outdoor advertising, and renewable power generation segments. We expect interest and other income to decrease in future periods as a result of the sale of $8.3 million in investments in receivables during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $6.8 million during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower average debt balance of approximately $395 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an average debt balance of approximately $442.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nIn connection with the Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility on November 15, 2018, a portion of the unamortized balance of the deferred loan costs totaling $0.2 million was recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Derivatives\nWe mitigated exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on existing variable rate debt by entering into swap contracts that fixed the floating LIBOR rate. These interest rate swap agreements extend through and beyond the term of the Partnership's existing credit facility. The swap contracts were adjusted to fair value at each period end. The unrealized loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 and unrealized gain for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflects the change in fair value of these contracts during those periods.\nEquity Income from Unconsolidated Joint Venture\nEquity income from unconsolidated joint venture increased $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 due to the formation of the JV on September 24, 2018. The Partnership accounts for its 50.01% investment in the unconsolidated JV using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at fair value and subsequently adjusted for additional distributions and the Partnership's proportionate share of equity in the JV's income. The Partnership recognizes its proportionate share of the ongoing income or loss of the unconsolidated JV as equity income from unconsolidated JV on the consolidated statements of operations.\nGain on Sale of Real Property Interests\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Partnership recognized gain on sale of real property interests of $18.0 million related to the sale of real property interests to third parties during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a gain on contribution of real property interests of $100 million in connection with the formation of the unconsolidated JV in which 545 tenant sites were contributed to the JV by the Partnership.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense increased $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a gain on sale of assets in our taxable subsidiary of $11.7 million, resulting in a $3.0 million income tax expense related to the gain.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nOn June 17, 2020, the Partnership sold its European outdoor advertising portfolio for a purchase price of \u00a395 million and recognized a total gain on sale of $15.5 million. The sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio met the criteria as discontinued operations in June 2020. As a result, we reclassified the operating results of the European outdoor advertising portfolio and gain on sale to discontinued operations and excluded these amounts from income from continuing operations for all periods presented on the consolidated statements of operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur short-term liquidity requirements will consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses, acquisitions and developments and other expenditures directly associated with our assets, including:\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> interest expense on our revolving credit facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> interest expense and principal payments on our secured notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> general and administrative expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 270: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> acquisitions of real property interests;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 271: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> capital expenditures for infrastructure developments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> distributions to our common and preferred unitholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe intend to satisfy our short-term liquidity requirements primarily through cash flow from operating activities and through borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. We may also satisfy our short-term liquidity requirements through the issuance of additional equity, asset dispositions, formation of joint ventures, amending our existing revolving credit facility to increase the available commitments or refinancing some of the outstanding borrowings under our existing credit facility through securitizations or other long-term debt arrangements. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms as well as to use cash from operations to continue to meet our liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors\u201d. Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. Credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well. The Partnership has a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, effective January 30, 2020, under which we have the ability to issue and sell common and preferred units representing limited partner interests in us and debt securities up to an aggregate amount of $750.0 million.\nOn January 22, 2021, the General Partner's board of directors approved a quarterly distribution of $0.20 per common unit for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The current quarter distribution equates to approximately $5.1 million per quarter, or $20.4 million per year in the aggregate, based on the number of common units outstanding as of February 2, 2021. As a result of the unprecedented economic conditions, we will focus on repaying borrowings under our revolving credit facility, preserving liquidity and capital for any potential impact to our business and positioning the Partnership to take advantage of any prospective market opportunities. We do not have a legal obligation to pay this distribution or any other distribution except to the extent we have available cash as defined in our Amended Partnership Agreement.\nWe intend to pay a quarterly Series A and Series B Preferred Unit distribution of 8.0% and 7.9%, respectively, which equates to approximately $2.2 million per quarter, or approximately $8.8 million per year in the aggregate based on the number of Preferred Units outstanding as of February 1, 2021. We intend to pay a quarterly Series C Preferred Units distribution of a rate equal to the greater of (i) 7.00% per annum, and (ii) the sum of (a) three-month LIBOR as calculated on each applicable date of determination and (b) 4.698% per annum, based on the $25.00 liquidation preference per Series C Preferred Unit. As of December 31, 2020, there were 1,982,700 Series C Preferred Units outstanding. The Preferred Unit distributions are cumulative from the date of original issuance and will be payable quarterly in arrears.\nThe amount of future distributions to unitholders will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and will be determined by the General Partner's Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The Partnership expects to rely on external financing sources, including equity and debt issuances, to fund expansion capital expenditures and future acquisitions. However, the Partnership may use operating cash flows to fund expansion capital expenditures or acquisitions, which could result in subsequent borrowings under the revolving credit facility to pay distributions or fund other short-term working capital requirements.\nThe requirements under our Partnership Agreement for the conversion of all the subordinated units into common units were satisfied upon the payment of our quarterly cash distribution on February 14, 2018. Therefore, effective February 15, 2018, all of our subordinated units which are owned by Landmark, were converted on a one-for-one basis into common units. The conversion of subordinated units does not impact the amount of cash distributions or total number of outstanding units.\nThe table below summarizes the quarterly distribution paid related to our financial results:\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $10.5 million to $42.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to asset acquisitions and the timing of prepaid expenses, other assets and payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which is partially offset by a reduction in return on investment in the unconsolidated joint venture.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash used for asset acquisitions and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, partially offset by the proceeds received from the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the proceeds received from the sale of real property interests in 2019.\nNet cash provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $25.6 million in net payments on the revolving credit facility and secured notes, $7.6 million of payments on the settlement of derivatives and $1.8 million of cash used for deferred loan costs offset by $12.2 million decrease in distributions and $0.2 million in proceeds from equity offerings.\nComparison of year ended December 31, 2019 to year ended December 31, 2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $0.4 million to $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Net cash used in investing activities was $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily attributable to the net increase of $53.3 million in proceeds from the net borrowings from the revolving credit facility and secured notes and the net decrease of $9.8 million used in deferred loan costs offset by net decrease of $43.4 million in proceeds from equity offerings during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, the difference between the cost and the sales price of the Drop-down Acquisition completed during the year ended December 31, 2018 is treated as a distribution to Landmark.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOur revolving credit facility will mature on November 15, 2023 and is available for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes, including distributions.

On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable indenture, subject to the conditions described in Note 10, Debt, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to the Partnership. As of December 31, 2020, $3.2 million was held in such reserve accounts which are classified as Restricted Cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain information with respect to the Secured Notes is set forth in Note 10, Debt. The DSCR is generally calculated as the ratio of annualized net cash flow (as defined in the applicable indenture) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Secured Notes, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.\nEach indenture includes covenants customary for notes issued in rated securitizations. Among other things, the related obligors are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets (as defined in the applicable agreement) and the organizational documents of the related obligors were amended to contain certain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purposes entities, including that the applicable issuer and guarantor maintain independent directors. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable obligors were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Secured Notes.\nCommitments\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 were (in thousands):\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Between\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Between\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility (principal)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 214,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 214,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility (interest)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured Notes (principal and interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 336,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DART\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Interest payable is based on the interest rates in effect on December 31, 2020, including the effect of the interest rate swaps and unused commitment fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShelf Registrations\nOn December 4, 2019, the Partnership filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. The shelf registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on January 30, 2020 and permits us to issue and sell, from time to time, common and preferred units representing limited partner interests in us, and debt securities up to an aggregate amount of $750.0 million.\nPreferred Equity Offerings\nOn April 2, 2018, the Partnership completed a public offering of 2,000,000 Series C Floating-to-Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Redeemable Convertible Preferred Units ( Series C Preferred Units\u201d), representing limited partner interest in the Partnership, at a price of $25.00 per unit. We received net proceeds of approximately $47.5 million after deducting underwriters' discounts and offering expenses paid by us of $2.5 million. We used substantially all net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nDistributions on the Series C Preferred Units will be the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year. The prorated initial distribution on the Series C Preferred Units was paid on May 15, 2018 in an amount equal to $0.2090 per Series C Preferred Unit. Distributions for the Series C Preferred Units will accrue from, and including the date of original issuance, to, but excluding, May 15, 2025, at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 7.00% per annum and (ii) the sum of (a) the three-month LIBOR as calculated on each applicable date of determination and (b) 4.698% per annum, based on the $25.00 liquidation preference per Series C Preferred Unit. On and after May 15, 2025, distributions on the Series C Preferred Units will accrue at 9.00% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per Series C Preferred Unit (equal to $2.25 per Series C Preferred Unit per annum). The Partnership shall have the option to redeem the Series C Preferred Units, in whole or in part, on or after May 20, 2025 at the liquidation preference of $25.00 per Series C Preferred Unit, plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to the date of redemption, whether or not declared.\nATM Programs\nOn February 28, 2020, the Partnership replaced the 2019 Common Unit at-the-market offering program with a 2020 Common Unit at-the-market offering program pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, Common Units having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million pursuant to our previously filed and effective registration statement on Form S-3. On February 28, 2020, the Partnership replaced the 2019 Series A ATM Program and established a new Series A Preferred Unit at-the-market offering program (the 2020 Series A ATM Program\u201d) pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, Series A Preferred Units having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million pursuant to our previously filed and effective registration statement on Form S-3. On February 28, 2020, the Partnership replaced the Series B ATM Program and established a new Series B Preferred Unit at-the-market offering program (the 2020 Series B ATM Program\u201d) pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, Series B Preferred Units having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million pursuant to our previously filed and effective registration statement on Form S-3. We intend to use the net proceeds from any sales pursuant to the ATM Programs for general partnership purposes, which may include, among other things, the repayment of indebtedness and to potentially fund future acquisitions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership issued a total of 109,724 Common Units, 23,287 Series A Preferred Units and 84,139 Series B Preferred Units under the 2019 ATM programs generating total proceeds of approximately $4.5 million before issuance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership issued 43,515 Series A Preferred Units under the 2020 Series A ATM Program, generating proceeds of approximately $1.1 million before issuance costs. There were no Common Units or Series B Preferred Units issued under the 2020 ATM programs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Partnership issued a total of 128,892 Series A Preferred Units and 81,778 Series B Preferred under the ATM Programs generating total proceeds of approximately $5.3 million before issuance costs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Partnership issued a total of 27,830 Common Units and 24,747 Series A Preferred Units under the ATM Programs generating total proceeds of approximately $1.1 million before issuance costs.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn connection with the issuance of the 4.38% Senior Secured Notes, the Partnership has a standby letter of credit arrangement totaling $2.4 million. In connection with the issuance of the 2019 Secured Notes, the Partnership has a standby letter of credit arrangement totaling $3.4 million. As of December 31, 2020, there were no amounts drawn on the standby letter of credit.\nThe Partnership does not have any other off balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nThe majority of our tenant lease arrangements are triple net or effectively triple net and provide for fixed-rate escalators or rent escalators tied to increases in the consumer price index. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and our tenants' (or the underlying property owners') obligations to pay taxes and expenses under our triple net and effectively triple net lease arrangements. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\nNewly Issued Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of newly issued

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to \"our partnership,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us,\" or like terms refer to Landmark Infrastructure Partners LP. The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial performance, financial condition and significant trends that may affect our future performance. You should read the following in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Among other things, those historical consolidated financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a growth-oriented partnership formed by Landmark Divided LLC ( Landmark\u201d or Sponsor\u201d) to acquire, develop, own and manage a portfolio of real property interests and infrastructure assets that are leased to companies in the wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising, and renewable power generation industries. In addition, the Partnership owns certain interests in receivables associated with similar assets. We generate revenue and cash flow from existing tenant leases of our real property interests and infrastructure assets to wireless carriers, cellular tower owners, outdoor advertisers, renewable power producers and colocation providers and other enterprises.\nThe Partnership is a master limited partnership organized in the State of Delaware and has been publicly traded since its initial public offering on November 19, 2014. On July 31, 2017, the Partnership completed changes to its organizational structure by transferring substantially all of its assets to a consolidated subsidiary, Landmark Infrastructure Inc., a Delaware corporation, which elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2017. We intend to continue to own and operate substantially all of our assets through the REIT Subsidiary. These changes are designed to simplify tax reporting for unitholders and broaden the Partnership's investor base by substantially eliminating unrelated business taxable income allocated by the Partnership to tax-exempt investors, including individuals investing through tax-deferred accounts such as an individual retirement account, and we do not intend to generate state source income.\nCOVID-19\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including how it will impact our tenants and business partners. While we did not incur significant disruptions during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties include the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and, as cases of COVID-19 have continued to be identified in additional countries, many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting the global economy. Further, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, consumer spending as well as other unanticipated consequences remain unknown.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our tenants and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. The current economic conditions, including the stay-at-home\u201d orders and similar mandates, have had and will likely continue to have a negative effect on the outdoor advertising industry. The Partnership has received and is currently reviewing a myriad of short-term rent relief requests from tenants within the outdoor advertising industry, most often in the form of rent deferral requests or amending to percentage rent. Not all tenant requests will ultimately result in modification agreements, nor is the Partnership forgoing its contractual rights under its lease agreements. The twelve months ended December 31, 2020 results may not be indicative of future results. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership generated $15.2 million in rental revenue from outdoor advertising tenants, $0.7 million of which was generated from percentage rent provisions.\nHow We Generate Rental Revenue\nWe primarily generate rental revenue and cash flow from existing leases of our tenant sites to wireless carriers, cellular tower owners, outdoor advertisers, renewable power producers and colocation providers and other enterprises. The amount of rental revenue generated by the assets in our portfolio depends principally on occupancy levels and the tenant lease rates and terms at our tenant sites.\nWe believe the terms of our tenant leases provide us with stable, predictable and growing cash flow. Substantially all of our tenant lease arrangements are triple net or effectively triple net, meaning that our tenants or the underlying property owners are generally contractually responsible for property-level operating expenses, including maintenance capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. For certain infrastructure assets, we incur ground rent obligations, maintenance expenditures, property taxes and insurance, some of which may be reimbursed by our tenants. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, 83% of our tenant leases (94% of rental revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2020) have contractual fixed-rate escalators or consumer price index ( CPI\u201d) -based rent escalators, and some of our tenant leases contain revenue-sharing provisions in addition to the base monthly or annual rental payments. Occupancy rates under our tenant leases have historically been very high. We also believe we are well positioned to negotiate higher rents in advance of lease expirations as tenants request lease amendments to accommodate equipment upgrades or add tenants to increase colocation.\nFuture economic or regional downturns affecting our submarkets that impair our ability to renew or re-lease our real property interests and other adverse developments that affect the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease obligations, such as tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our sites. Adverse developments or trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental revenue and tenant recoveries in future periods.\nSignificant consolidation among our tenants in the wireless communication industry (or our tenants' sub-lessees) may result in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites, because certain portions of these tenants' (or their sub-lessees') networks may be redundant. The loss of any one of our large customers as a result of joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions or other cooperative agreements may result in a material decrease in our revenue. On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint completed their merger. The Partnership does not expect the merger to have a material impact on rental revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, T-Mobile represented approximately 14% of rental revenue.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (1) occupancy and rental revenue; (2) operating and maintenance expenses; (3) FFO and AFFO; and (4) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nOccupancy and Rental Revenue\nThe amount of revenue we generate primarily depends on our occupancy rate. As of December 31, 2020, we had a 94% occupancy rate with 1,874 of our 1,986 available tenant sites leased. We believe the infrastructure assets at our tenant sites are essential to the ongoing operations and profitability of our tenants and will be a critical component for the rollout of future technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous vehicles. Combined with the challenges and costs of relocating the infrastructure, we believe that we will continue to enjoy high tenant retention and occupancy rates.\nThere has been consolidation in the wireless communication industry historically that has led to certain lease terminations. On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint completed their merger. The Partnership does not expect the merger to have a material impact on rental revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, T-Mobile represented approximately 14% of rental revenue. Additional consolidation among our tenants in the wireless communication industry (or our tenants' sub-lessees) may result in lease terminations for certain existing communication sites. Any additional termination of leases in our portfolio would result in lower rental revenue, may lead to impairment of our real property interests, or other adverse effects to our business.\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses\nSubstantially all of our tenant sites are subject to triple net or effectively triple net lease arrangements, which require the tenant or the underlying property owner to pay all utilities, property taxes, insurance and repair and maintenance costs. Our overall financial results could be impacted to the extent the owners of the fee interest in the real property or our tenants do not satisfy their obligations or to the extent a jurisdiction applies real property tax to our easements.\nFFO and AFFO\nFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents net income (loss) excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization expense, real estate related impairment charges, gains (or losses) on real estate transactions, adjustments for unconsolidated joint venture, and distributions to preferred unitholders and noncontrolling interests.\nFFO is generally considered by industry analysts to be the most appropriate measure of performance of real estate companies. FFO does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of the Partnership's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. The Partnership's computation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nAFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. AFFO adjusts FFO for certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with GAAP. AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net earnings, as an indication of the Partnership's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental measure of the Partnership's performance. The Partnership's computation of AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. We calculate AFFO by starting with FFO and adjusting for general and administrative expense reimbursement, acquisition-related expenses, unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives, straight line rent adjustments, unit-based compensation, amortization of deferred loan costs and discount on secured notes, deferred income tax expense, amortization of above and below market rents, loss on extinguishment of debt, repayments of receivables, adjustments for investment in unconsolidated joint venture, adjustments for drop-down assets and foreign currency transaction gain (loss). The GAAP measures most directly comparable to FFO and AFFO is net income.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and we define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before impairments, acquisition-related expenses, unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivatives, loss on extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on sale of real property interests, unit-based compensation, straight line rental adjustments, amortization of above- and below-market rents plus cash receipts applied toward the repayments of investments in receivable, the deemed capital contribution to fund our general and administrative expense reimbursement and adjustments for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. During the third quarter of 2019, we changed our definition of EBITDA to exclude adjustments for investments in unconsolidated joint venture to adhere to the definition of EBITDA as described in item 10(e)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-K. During the fourth quarter 2017, we changed our definition of Adjusted EBITDA by adding cash receipts applied toward the repayments of investments in receivables. We made this change to better reflect the quarterly amount of operating surplus as determined by our amended and restated partnership agreement. These changes did not have a material impact on our EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA and prior period amounts have been recasted to conform to current presentation.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded limited partnerships, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; \n \u2022 the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders; \n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and \n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. \nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Each of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. You should not consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. As a result, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nFor a further discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures of FFO, AFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA flow, and a reconciliation of FFO, AFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read Selected Historical Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results\nOur future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations for the reasons described below:\nCOVID-19\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate and development generally and those risks listed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, management and operation of our properties. However, due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, the Partnership's tenants and their operations may be impacted, including their ability to pay rent. The impact of COVID-19 on our future results could be significant and will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the success of actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19 and reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture\nOn September 24, 2018, the Partnership completed the formation of an unconsolidated joint venture (the JV\u201d). The Partnership contributed 545 tenant site assets to the unconsolidated JV that secured the Partnership's $125.4 million Series 2018-1 secured notes (the 2018 Securitization\u201d), in exchange for a 50.01% membership interest in the unconsolidated JV and $65.5 million in cash (the Transaction\u201d). The Partnership used $59.7 million of the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The Partnership deconsolidated the 545 tenant sites and real property interests and recognized a gain on contribution of real property interests of $100 million. The Partnership does not control the unconsolidated JV and therefore, accounts for its investment in the unconsolidated JV using the equity method of accounting prospectively upon formation of the unconsolidated JV.\nAcquisitions and Developments\nWe have in the past and intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of real property interests and developments of infrastructure. Our significant historical acquisition activity impacts the period to period comparability of our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Partnership completed one drop-down acquisition from our Sponsor and affiliates (collectively the Drop-down Acquisitions\u201d or Drop-down Assets\u201d). The Drop-down Assets acquired by the Partnership included an aggregate of 127 tenant sites for the year ended December 31, 2018 in exchange for total consideration of $59.9 million. The Drop-down Acquisitions are a transfer of net assets between entities under common control as the acquisitions do not meet the definition of a business in accordance with ASU No. 2017-01. The transfer of net assets is accounted for prospectively in the period in which the transfer occurs at the net carrying value. Any differences between the cash consideration and the net carrying value of the transfer of net assets have been allocated to the General Partner.\nAdditionally, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Partnership acquired 15 tenant sites, 146 tenant sites and 104 tenant sites from third parties for a total consideration of $144.2 million, $52.0 million and $75.8 million, respectively. See Note 3, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2020, we focused on the acquisition of multiple data center properties with long-term triple net leases totaling $142.8 million.\nSales\nThe Partnership's sales of real property interests impacts the period to period comparability of our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership completed the sale of its interest in the consolidated joint venture that holds its European outdoor advertising portfolio and recognized a gain on sale of real property interest of $15.5 million. The operating results of the European outdoor advertising portfolio and the related gain on sale are presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, for all prior periods presented, the related assets and liabilities are presented as assets and liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. The Partnership used proceeds from the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio and available cash to repay borrowings totaling $115 million on its revolving credit facility, including the \u00a340.5 million of British pound sterling ( GBP\u201d) denominated borrowings, and terminate USD interest rate swaps with a notional value of $145 million and a GBP denominated interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of \u00a338 million for approximately $7.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Partnership completed sales of its real property interests and investments in receivables for total consideration of $46.4 million and recognized a gain on sale of $18.0 million.\nSecured Notes\nOn January 15, 2020, certain subsidiaries of the Partnership entered into a master note purchase and participation agreement ( MNPPA\u201d) pursuant to which such subsidiaries issued and sold an initial $170 million aggregate principal amount of 3.90% series A senior secured notes in a private placement (the 2019 Secured Notes\u201d). The 2019 Secured Notes mature on January 14, 2027 and include an interest-only initial term of three years. The net proceeds were used to repay in full the 2016 Secured Notes by $108 million and the revolving credit facility by $59 million. In connection with the issuance of the senior secured notes, the Partnership obtained a standby letter of credit arrangement totaling $3.4 million.\nOn June 6, 2018, the Partnership completed the 2018 Securitization involving a segregated pool of wireless communication sites and related property interests owned by certain special purpose subsidiaries of the Partnership, through the issuance of the 2018-1 Secured Tenant Site Contract Revenue Notes, Class C, Class D and Class F (the 2018 Secured Notes\u201d), in an aggregate principal amount of $125.4 million. The Class C, Class D and Class F 2018 Secured Notes bear interest at a fixed note rate per annum of 3.97%, 4.70% and 5.92%, respectively. On September 24, 2018, the Partnership completed the formation of an unconsolidated joint venture by contributing certain special purpose subsidiaries to the unconsolidated joint venture, including the 2018 Secured Notes. See Note 8, Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture and Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOn April 24, 2018, a special purpose subsidiary of the Partnership entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which such subsidiary agreed to sell approximately $43.7 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.38% senior secured notes in a private placement (the 4.38% Senior Secured Notes\u201d). The 4.38% Senior Secured Notes are fully amortizing through June 30, 2036. The 4.38% Senior Secured Notes are secured by a segregated pool of renewable power generation sites and related property interests owned directly or indirectly by such subsidiary.\nThe secured notes described above are collectively referred to as the Secured Notes.\u201d See Note 9, Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn November 15, 2018, the Partnership completed its Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility and obtained commitments from a syndicate of banks with initial borrowing commitments of $450.0 million for five-years. Additionally, borrowings up to $75.0 million may be denominated in GBP, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. Loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR related to the currency for which borrowings are denominated, plus a spread ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% (determined based on leverage levels). As of December 31, 2020, the applicable spread was 2.25%. Additionally, under the revolving credit facility we will be subject to an annual commitment fee (determined based on leverage levels) associated with the available undrawn capacity subject to certain restrictions. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable annual commitment rate used was 0.20%.\nSeries C Preferred Units\nOn April 2, 2018, the Partnership completed a public offering of 2,000,000 Series C Floating-to-Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Redeemable Convertible Preferred Units ( Series C Preferred Units\u201d), representing limited partner interest in the Partnership, at a price of $25.00 per unit. We received net proceeds of approximately $47.5 million after deducting underwriters' discounts and offering expenses paid by us of $2.5 million. We used substantially all net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nHolders of Series C Preferred Units, at their option, may, at any time and from time to time, convert some or all of their Series C Preferred Units based on an initial conversion rate of 1.3017 common units per Series C Preferred Unit. In the event of a fundamental change, holder of the Series C Preferred Units, at their option, may convert some or all of their Series C Preferred Units into the greater of (i) a number of common units plus a make-whole premium and (ii) a number of common units equal to the lessor of (a) the liquidation preference divided by the market value of our common units on the effective date of such fundamental change and (b) 11.13 (subject to adjustments). On May 15, 2025, May 15, 2028, and each subsequent five-year anniversary date thereafter (each such date, a designated redemption date\u201d), each holder of Series C Preferred Units shall have the right (a redemption right\u201d) to require the Partnership to redeem any or all of the Series C Preferred Units held by such holder outstanding on such designated redemption date at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference of $25.00, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to, but not including, in each case out of funds legally available for such payment and to the extent not prohibited by law, the designated redemption date (the put redemption price\u201d). At our option we may pay the redemption in our common units or cash, subject to certain limitations.\nAt any time on or after May 20, 2025, the Partnership shall have the option to redeem the Series C Preferred Units, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of $25.00 per Series C Preferred Unit plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to the date of redemption, whether or not declared. See Note 12, Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nHistorically we have hedged a portion of the variable interest rates under our secured debt facilities through interest rate swap agreements. We have not applied hedge accounting to these derivative financial instruments which has resulted in the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements to be reflected in income as either a realized or unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives, except for foreign currency changes on interest rate swaps denominated in a foreign currency. In connection with the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio, the Partnership used proceeds from the sale to terminate existing USD interest rate swaps with a notional value of $145 million and a GBP denominated interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of \u00a338 million for approximately $7.6 million. On September 29, 2020, the Partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $60 million with a fixed rate at 0.18% per annum and a maturity date of November 15, 2023. On December 30, 2020, the Partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $40 million with a fixed rate at 0.21% per annum and a maturity date of November 15, 2023.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nUnder the Partnership's Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Landmark Infrastructure Partners LP dated April 2, 2018 (the Amended Partnership Agreement\u201d), we are required to reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all costs and expenses that they incur on our behalf for managing and controlling our business and operations. Except to the extent specified under our amended Omnibus Agreement with Landmark (the Omnibus Agreement\u201d), which was amended on January 30, 2019, our general partner determines the amount of these expenses and such determinations must be made in good faith under the terms of the Partnership Agreement. Under the Omnibus Agreement, we agreed to reimburse Landmark for expenses related to certain general and administrative services that Landmark will provide to us in support of our business, subject to a quarterly cap equal to 3% of our revenue during the current calendar quarter. This cap on expenses will last until the earlier to occur of: (i) the date on which our revenue for the immediately preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeded $120 million and (ii) November 19, 2021. The full amount of our general and administrative expenses incurred will be reflected on our income statements, and to the extent such general and administrative expenses exceed the cap amount, the amount of such excess will be reflected in our financial statements as a capital contribution from Landmark rather than as a reduction of our general and administrative expenses, except for expenses that would otherwise be allocated to us, which are not included in the amount of general and administrative expenses.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nCOVID-19\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate and development generally and those risks listed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, management and operation of our properties. However, due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, the Partnership's tenants and their operations may be impacted, including their ability to pay rent. The impact of COVID-19 on our future results could be significant and will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the success of actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19 and reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets.\nAcquisitions and Developments\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of real property interests from third parties and developments of infrastructure, utilizing the expertise of our management and other Landmark employees to identify and assess potential acquisitions, for which we may pay Landmark mutually agreed reasonable fees. When acquiring real property interests, we will target infrastructure locations that are essential to the ongoing operations and profitability of our tenants, which we expect will result in continued high tenant occupancy and enhance our cash flow stability. For our digital infrastructure industry, we focus on acquiring mission-critical, high-quality, network-neutral, single and multi-tenant data centers, primarily supporting colocation/cloud, wholesale colocation and enterprise tenants, in strategic markets. We expect the data center assets to have high-quality anchor tenants in place for whom the data center is critically important for its continued operations as well as leases that are structured on a long-term, net basis and contain contractual rent escalators. Additionally, we will focus on infrastructure locations with characteristics that are difficult to replicate in their respective markets, and those with tenant assets that cannot be easily moved to nearby alternative sites or replaced by new construction. Although our initial portfolio is focused on wireless communication, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation assets in the United States, we intend to grow our initial portfolio of real property interests into other fragmented infrastructure asset classes and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions internationally. The impact of COVID-19 may restrict access to construction materials and delay development projects.\nDuring 2017, the Partnership started developing an ecosystem of technologies that provides smart enabled infrastructure including stealth towers and digital outdoor advertising kiosks across North America. Stealth towers are self-contained, neutral-host towers designed for wireless carrier and other wireless operator collocation. The stealth towers are designed for macro, mini macro and small cell deployments and will support Internet of Things (IoT), carrier densification needs, private LTE networks and other wireless solutions.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Partnership entered into an agreement with DART to develop a smart media and communications platform which will include the deployment of content-rich kiosks and the Partnership's smart enabled infrastructure ecosystem solution on strategic high-traffic DART locations.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership deployed two stealth towers, 112 DART kiosks and placed in service other assets for a total of $16.2 million. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Partnership deployed nine and four infrastructure sites totaling $1.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. As we deploy these infrastructure assets, we may incur additional operating expenses associated with ground lease payments and other operating expenses to maintain our infrastructure assets. Additionally, the Partnership may pursue further development opportunities in the future. The impact of COVID-19 has at times limited access to construction materials and delayed development projects and may continue to impact the pace of developments.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture\nOn September 24, 2018, the Partnership completed the formation of the unconsolidated JV. The Partnership contributed 545 tenant site assets to the unconsolidated JV that secured the Partnership's 2018 Securitization in exchange for a 50.01% membership interest in the unconsolidated JV and $65.5 million in cash. The Partnership does not control the unconsolidated JV and therefore, accounts for its investment in the unconsolidated JV using the equity method of accounting prospectively upon formation of the unconsolidated JV.\nSales\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership completed the sale of its interest in the consolidated joint venture that holds its European outdoor advertising portfolio and recognized a gain on sale of real property interest of $15.5 million in discontinued operations. The Partnership used proceeds from the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio and available cash to repay borrowings totaling $115 million on its revolving credit facility, including the \u00a340.5 million of GBP denominated borrowings, and terminate USD interest rate swaps with a notional value of $145 million and a GBP denominated interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of \u00a338 million for approximately $7.6 million.\nMergers\nSignificant consolidation among our tenants in the wireless communication industry (or our tenants' sub-lessees) may result in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites, because certain portions of these tenants' (or their sub-lessees') networks may be redundant. The loss of any one of our large customers as a result of joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions or other cooperative agreements may result in a material decrease in our revenue. On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint completed their merger. For the year ended December 31, 2020, T-Mobile represented approximately 14% of rental revenue.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn November 15, 2018, the Partnership completed its Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility and obtained commitments from a syndicate of banks with initial borrowing commitments of $450.0 million for five-years. Additionally, borrowings up to $75.0 million may be denominated in GBP, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. As of November 1, 2019, the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility denominated in GBP was \u00a340.5 million. Loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR, plus a spread ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% (determined based on leverage levels). As of December 31, 2020, the applicable spread was 2.25%. Additionally, under the revolving credit facility we will be subject to an annual commitment fee (determined based on leverage levels) associated with the available undrawn capacity subject to certain restrictions. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable annual commitment rate used was 0.20%.\nSecured Notes\nOn January 15, 2020, certain subsidiaries of the Partnership entered into a MNPPA pursuant to which such subsidiaries issued and sold an initial $170 million aggregate principal amount of 3.90% series A senior secured notes in a private placement. The senior secured notes mature on January 14, 2027 and include an interest-only initial term of three years. The net proceeds were used to repay in full the 2016 Secured Notes by $108 million and the revolving credit facility by $59 million. In connection with the issuance of the senior secured notes, the Partnership obtained a standby letter of credit arrangement totaling $3.4 million.\nChanging Interest Rates and Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nInterest rates have been at or near historic lows in recent years. If interest rates rise, this may impact the availability and terms of debt financing, our interest expense associated with existing and future debt or our ability to make accretive acquisitions. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currencies in which the Partnership operates may impact the availability and terms of debt financing, our interest expense associated with existing and future debt or our ability to make accretive acquisitions.\nLIBOR Phase Out\nIn July 2017, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the ARRC which identified the SOFR as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. The Partnership is not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets. Any changes adopted by FCA or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR. If that were to occur, our interest payments could change. In addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in its current form.\nThe Partnership has agreements that are indexed to LIBOR and is monitoring and evaluating the related risks, which include interest on loans and valuation of derivative instruments. These risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to a new alternative rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur. The value of loans or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued. For some instruments, the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging, as they may require negotiation with the respective counterparty.\nIf a contract is not transitioned to an alternative rate and LIBOR is discontinued, the impact on our contracts is likely to vary by contract. If LIBOR is discontinued or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected.\nWhile we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point. This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. Our revolving credit facility contains fallback language generally consistent with the ARRC's amendment approach, which provides a streamlined amendment approach for negotiating a benchmark replacement and introduces clarity with respect to the fallback trigger events and an adjustment to be applied to the successor rate. We continue to monitor developments by the ARRC and the potential impact of LIBOR changes on our business.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following discussion of critical accounting policies uses we\u201d, our\u201d and the Partnership\u201d interchangeably. Our discussion and analysis of the historical financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We have provided a summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership, included elsewhere in Part IV, Item 15(a)(1). We have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial condition and results of operations. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those of other companies.\nA critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. Generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by the users of our financial statements in their evaluation of our performance. Of the accounting policies discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership, included in Part IV, Item 15(a)(1), the accounting policies presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies.\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisitions\nThe Partnership applies the asset acquisition method to all acquired investments of real property interests for transactions that meet the definition of an asset acquisition. The purchase consideration of the real property interests is allocated to the acquired tangible asset, such as land and building, and the identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of perpetual and limited life easements, above-market and below-market leases and in-place leases, based in each case on their fair values. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using the discounted cash flow valuation method. In certain instances, such as data center acquisitions, the sales comparison approach is used to determine the fair value of the land assets, the cost approach to determine the fair value of the building and site improvements, and the income approach to determine the fair value of the real property interest and liability assumed. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, the Partnership estimates the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future cash flows. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized.\nFactors considered in estimating the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired include information obtained about each asset as a result of Landmark's pre-acquisition due diligence and its marketing and leasing activities. In order to calculate the estimated in-place lease value, we employed the income approach in accordance with ASC 805 by multiplying the anticipated market absorption period by the market rent at the time of acquisition for each in-place lease agreement. Based on our experience in the industry, we have determined a range of lease execution timelines to be between one and twelve months. For the in-place lease valuation, we consider a lease-up period of four to eight months to be representative of the market.\nWe estimated the fair value of real property interests using the income approach. The discount rates used ranged from 6% to 20% with a weighted average discount rate of 8.5%. In certain instances, such as data center acquisitions, the sales comparison approach is used to determine the fair value of the land assets, the cost approach to determine the fair value of the building and site improvements, and the income approach to\ndetermine the fair value of the real property interest and liability assumed. The value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in-place tenant lease value for the real estate acquired as such value and its consequence to amortization expense is materially consistent with the in-place lease value for these particular acquisitions. Should future acquisitions of real property interests result in allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships, an amount would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationship. The value of in-place leases and customer relationship is amortized to expense over the estimated period the tenant is expected to be leasing the site under the existing terms which typically range from 2 to 20 years. If a tenant lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be impaired.\nThe discount rate associated with each asset varies based on the location of an asset (including demographics and zoning restrictions), and other asset specific characteristics. Market rent for each asset is determined based on location of each asset, asset type, zoning restrictions, ground space necessary for the tenant's equipment, remaining site capacity, visibility (specifically for billboards), and nearby sites.\nIn allocating the purchase consideration of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired asset, above-market, below-market and in-place lease values are calculated based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over the estimated period the tenant is expected to be leasing the site under the above or below-market terms. The capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as a decrease or increase, respectively, to rental income over the estimated period the tenant is expected to be leasing the site. Wireless communication and outdoor advertising tenant leases obtained by us through acquisition of real property interests are generally cancellable, upon 30 to 180 days' notice by the tenants, with no significant penalty. Digital infrastructure and renewable power generation tenant leases are generally non-cancellable. With respect to below-market leases, consideration is given to any below-market renewal periods. However, for wireless communication assets, we estimated the above- or below-market lease value over an analysis period of the earlier of the lease expiration or 10 years based on estimated useful life of the underlying equipment and assets. For outdoor advertising assets, we estimated the above- or below-market lease value over an analysis period of the earlier of the lease expiration or 20 years, based on a longer estimated useful life of 20 years for outdoor advertising assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Development Projects\nWe assess the carrying values of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future net cash flow, undiscounted and without interest, expected to be generated by the asset.\nIn evaluating our assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change, as well as other factors. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including the income approach using a market discount rate, terminal capitalization rate and rental rate assumptions, or on the sales comparison approach to similar assets. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flow, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our assets that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairments of our assets.\nDevelopment projects and other similar contracts are also assessed to determine whether it continues to meet our investment return standards. Assessments are made separately for each project on a quarterly basis and are affected by the following factors relative to the market in which the asset is located, among others: estimated development and construction costs and projected profitability. When a decision is made to cease construction on certain projects due to market conditions and/or fluctuations in our development strategy, we write off the related capitalized costs, including pre-construction costs. Based on the results of our assessments, there were no construction in progress impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized impairment charges related to certain construction in progress of $1.6 million and included in impairment in our consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Partnership recognizes rental income under operating leases, including rental abatements, lease incentives and contractual fixed increases, if any, from tenants under lease arrangements with minimum fixed and determinable increases on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the related leases when collectability is reasonably assured. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are recorded as deferred rent assets. The excess of rent payments collected over amounts recognized contractually due pursuant to the underlying lease are recorded as prepaid rents. The Partnership accounts for and presents tenant reimbursements as a component of rental revenue in our consolidated income statements in accordance with the new lease standard ( ASC 842\u201d). Tenant reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant's obligation to reimburse us arises.\nLeases obtained by the Partnership through its acquisition and ownership of real property interests are generally cancelable upon 30-180 days' notice by the tenants with no significant penalty. The Partnership evaluates whether the lease arrangements economically compel the tenant to not cancel the lease in determining the term of the lease by considering various factors such as cancellation rights, availability of alternative sites, and historical cancellation rates. For cancellable leases where the tenant is not economically compelled to continue the lease, the term of the lease is considered to be the non-cancellable period with rental abatements and contractual fixed rate increases recorded in the period the amounts become due and payable. Leases obtained through development projects, are generally non-cancellable for the initial term.\n \u2022 Wireless Communication - As a result of various factors, including the cancellation rights, ability to find alternative sites, credit risk, and historical cancellation and lease amendment rates, the lease term is generally considered to be the non-cancellable term of the lease of 30 to 180 days. For these leases, rental abatements and contractual fixed increases are recorded in the period the amounts become due and payable. \n \u2022 Digital Infrastructure - The lease term is generally non-cancellable. \n \u2022 Outdoor Advertising and Renewable Power Generation - The lease term is generally considered to be the non-cancellable term of the remaining portion of the existing term of the lease. \nThe capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as a decrease or increase, respectively, to rental income over the estimated period the tenant is expected to be leasing the site.\nOur ability to accurately estimate the term of our tenant leases is critical to the amount of revenue we recognize.\nResults of Operations of our Partnership\nSegments\nIn connection with the sale of our European outdoor advertising portfolio, an evaluation of segment reporting thresholds resulted in changes in our segment presentation for all prior periods presented. As of June 30, 2020, we conduct business through four reportable business segments: Wireless Communication, Digital Infrastructure, Outdoor Advertising and Renewable Power Generation. Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are commonly managed, as all four businesses require similar marketing and business strategies. We evaluate our segments based on revenue because substantially all of our tenant lease arrangements are triple net or effectively triple net. We believe this measure provides investors relevant and useful information because it is presented on an unlevered basis.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations for all periods presented were affected by the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio on June 17, 2020, other asset sales in 2019, formation of the unconsolidated JV on September 24, 2018, and acquisitions made during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 1,986 and 2,025 available tenant sites, respectively.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2020 to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated statements of operations for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n\nRental Revenue\nRental revenue increased $5.1 million primarily due to $3.6 million increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 attributable to digital infrastructure acquisitions in 2020 and $1.8 million increase attributable to the full year of rental revenue in 2020 for tenant sites acquired during 2019, offset by $0.3 million of decline in outdoor advertising rental revenue. Revenue generated in 2020 from our wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation segments was $25.7 million, $9.9, million, $15.2 million and $8.1 million or 43%, 17%, 26% and 14% of total rental revenue, respectively, compared to $25.5 million, $4.2 million, $15.5 million and $8.5 million or 47%, 8%, 29% and 16% of total rental revenue, respectively, during 2019. The occupancy rates in our wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation segments were 92%, 100%, 96% and 100%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 compared to 93%, 100%, 97% and 100%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, our effective monthly rental rates per tenant site for wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation segments were $2,013, $82,006, $1,907 and $9,611, respectively, during 2020 compared to $1,953, $62,761, $1,953 and $9,214, respectively, during 2019.\nProperty Operating\nProperty operating expenses increased $0.4 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in rent expense on assets subject to a ground lease payment. Substantially all of our tenant sites are leased to tenants under triple net or effectively triple net lease arrangements, which require the tenant or the underlying property owner to pay all utilities, property taxes, insurance and repair and maintenance costs. As we deploy our smart enabled infrastructure solutions and other projects, we may incur additional operating expenses associated with ground lease payments and other operating expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $0.5 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in legal related expenses. Under our Amended Partnership Agreement, we are required to reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all costs and expenses that they incur on our behalf for managing and controlling our business and operations. Except to the extent specified under our Omnibus Agreement, our general partner determines the amount of these expenses and such determinations must be made in good faith under the terms of the Amended Partnership Agreement. On January 30, 2019, we amended the Omnibus Agreement and agreed to reimburse Landmark for expenses related to certain general and administrative services that Landmark will provide to us in support of our business, subject to a quarterly cap equal to 3% of our revenue during the current calendar quarter. Under the amended Omnibus Agreement, this cap on expenses will last until the earlier to occur of: (i) the date on which our revenue for the immediately preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeded $120 million and (ii) November 19, 2021. The full amount of general and administrative expenses incurred is reflected on our income statements and the amount in excess of the cap that is reimbursed is reflected on our financial statements as a capital contribution from Sponsor rather than as a reduction of our general and administrative expenses, except for expenses that would otherwise be allocated to us, which are not included in the amount of general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Landmark reimbursed us $3.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, for expenses related to certain general and administrative expenses that exceeded the cap. Included in the total general and expenses reimbursement from Sponsor is $0.3 million, respectively, of management fees related to our unconsolidated joint venture that is not subject to the cap and is treated as a capital contribution from Sponsor. Additionally, indemnification of $0.4 million related to property taxes is included in capital contributions from Sponsor on the Consolidated Statements of Equity and Mezzanine Equity for 2019.\nAcquisition-Related\nAcquisition-related expenses are third party fees and expenses related to acquiring an asset and include survey, title, legal and other items as well as legal and financial advisor expenses associated with business acquisitions or unsuccessful asset acquisitions.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $3.0 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of acquisitions and the deployment of two stealth towers, 112 DART kiosks and other assets placed in service in 2020.\nImpairments\nImpairments decreased $2.0 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to five lease terminations and one non-lease renewal in our wireless and outdoor advertising segments for $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to impairment charges related to certain construction in progress contracts and eight lease terminations in our wireless communication and outdoor advertising segments for $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest and Other Income\nInterest and other income decreased $0.1 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of the sale of investments in receivables during the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income on receivables is generated from our wireless communication, outdoor advertising, and renewable power generation segments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $0.2 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower interest rates during 2020 compared to 2019.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2019 Secured Notes, the Partnership repaid in full the 2016 Secured Notes by $108 million. The unamortized balance of the deferred loan costs totaling $1.2 million and a $1.0 million make-whole payment were recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nUnrealized Loss on Derivatives\nWe mitigated exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on existing variable rate debt by entering into swap contracts that fixed the floating LIBOR rate. These interest rate swap agreements extend through and beyond the term of the Partnership's existing credit facility. The swap contracts were adjusted to fair value at each period end. The unrealized loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 and unrealized loss for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflects the change in fair value of these", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to \"our partnership,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us,\" or like terms refer to Landmark Infrastructure Partners LP. The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial performance, financial condition and significant trends that may affect our future performance. You should read the following in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Among other things, those historical consolidated financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a growth-oriented partnership formed by Landmark Divided LLC ( Landmark\u201d or Sponsor\u201d) to acquire, develop, own and manage a portfolio of real property interests and infrastructure assets that are leased to companies in the wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising, and renewable power generation industries. In addition, the Partnership owns certain interests in receivables associated with similar assets. We generate revenue and cash flow from existing tenant leases of our real property interests and infrastructure assets to wireless carriers, cellular tower owners, outdoor advertisers, renewable power producers and colocation providers and other enterprises.\nThe Partnership is a master limited partnership organized in the State of Delaware and has been publicly traded since its initial public offering on November 19, 2014. On July 31, 2017, the Partnership completed changes to its organizational structure by transferring substantially all of its assets to a consolidated subsidiary, Landmark Infrastructure Inc., a Delaware corporation, which elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2017. We intend to continue to own and operate substantially all of our assets through the REIT Subsidiary. These changes are designed to simplify tax reporting for unitholders and broaden the Partnership's investor base by substantially eliminating unrelated business taxable income allocated by the Partnership to tax-exempt investors, including individuals investing through tax-deferred accounts such as an individual retirement account, and we do not intend to generate state source income.\nCOVID-19\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including how it will impact our tenants and business partners. While we did not incur significant disruptions during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties include the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and, as cases of COVID-19 have continued to be identified in additional countries, many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting the global economy. Further, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, consumer spending as well as other unanticipated consequences remain unknown.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our tenants and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. The current economic conditions, including the stay-at-home\u201d orders and similar mandates, have had and will likely continue to have a negative effect on the outdoor advertising industry. The Partnership has received and is currently reviewing a myriad of short-term rent relief requests from tenants within the outdoor advertising industry, most often in the form of rent deferral requests or amending to percentage rent. Not all tenant requests will ultimately result in modification agreements, nor is the Partnership forgoing its contractual rights under its lease agreements. The twelve months ended December 31, 2020 results may not be indicative of future results. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership generated $15.2 million in rental revenue from outdoor advertising tenants, $0.7 million of which was generated from percentage rent provisions.\nHow We Generate Rental Revenue\nWe primarily generate rental revenue and cash flow from existing leases of our tenant sites to wireless carriers, cellular tower owners, outdoor advertisers, renewable power producers and colocation providers and other enterprises. The amount of rental revenue generated by the assets in our portfolio depends principally on occupancy levels and the tenant lease rates and terms at our tenant sites.\nWe believe the terms of our tenant leases provide us with stable, predictable and growing cash flow. Substantially all of our tenant lease arrangements are triple net or effectively triple net, meaning that our tenants or the underlying property owners are generally contractually responsible for property-level operating expenses, including maintenance capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. For certain infrastructure assets, we incur ground rent obligations, maintenance expenditures, property taxes and insurance, some of which may be reimbursed by our tenants. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, 83% of our tenant leases (94% of rental revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2020) have contractual fixed-rate escalators or consumer price index ( CPI\u201d) -based rent escalators, and some of our tenant leases contain revenue-sharing provisions in addition to the base monthly or annual rental payments. Occupancy rates under our tenant leases have historically been very high. We also believe we are well positioned to negotiate higher rents in advance of lease expirations as tenants request lease amendments to accommodate equipment upgrades or add tenants to increase colocation.\nFuture economic or regional downturns affecting our submarkets that impair our ability to renew or re-lease our real property interests and other adverse developments that affect the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease obligations, such as tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our sites. Adverse developments or trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental revenue and tenant recoveries in future periods.\nSignificant consolidation among our tenants in the wireless communication industry (or our tenants' sub-lessees) may result in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites, because certain portions of these tenants' (or their sub-lessees') networks may be redundant. The loss of any one of our large customers as a result of joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions or other cooperative agreements may result in a material decrease in our revenue. On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint completed their merger. The Partnership does not expect the merger to have a material impact on rental revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, T-Mobile represented approximately 14% of rental revenue.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (1) occupancy and rental revenue; (2) operating and maintenance expenses; (3) FFO and AFFO; and (4) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nOccupancy and Rental Revenue\nThe amount of revenue we generate primarily depends on our occupancy rate. As of December 31, 2020, we had a 94% occupancy rate with 1,874 of our 1,986 available tenant sites leased. We believe the infrastructure assets at our tenant sites are essential to the ongoing operations and profitability of our tenants and will be a critical component for the rollout of future technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous vehicles. Combined with the challenges and costs of relocating the infrastructure, we believe that we will continue to enjoy high tenant retention and occupancy rates.\nThere has been consolidation in the wireless communication industry historically that has led to certain lease terminations. On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint completed their merger. The Partnership does not expect the merger to have a material impact on rental revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, T-Mobile represented approximately 14% of rental revenue. Additional consolidation among our tenants in the wireless communication industry (or our tenants' sub-lessees) may result in lease terminations for certain existing communication sites. Any additional termination of leases in our portfolio would result in lower rental revenue, may lead to impairment of our real property interests, or other adverse effects to our business.\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses\nSubstantially all of our tenant sites are subject to triple net or effectively triple net lease arrangements, which require the tenant or the underlying property owner to pay all utilities, property taxes, insurance and repair and maintenance costs. Our overall financial results could be impacted to the extent the owners of the fee interest in the real property or our tenants do not satisfy their obligations or to the extent a jurisdiction applies real property tax to our easements.\nFFO and AFFO\nFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents net income (loss) excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization expense, real estate related impairment charges, gains (or losses) on real estate transactions, adjustments for unconsolidated joint venture, and distributions to preferred unitholders and noncontrolling interests.\nFFO is generally considered by industry analysts to be the most appropriate measure of performance of real estate companies. FFO does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of the Partnership's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. The Partnership's computation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nAFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. AFFO adjusts FFO for certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with GAAP. AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net earnings, as an indication of the Partnership's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental measure of the Partnership's performance. The Partnership's computation of AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. We calculate AFFO by starting with FFO and adjusting for general and administrative expense reimbursement, acquisition-related expenses, unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives, straight line rent adjustments, unit-based compensation, amortization of deferred loan costs and discount on secured notes, deferred income tax expense, amortization of above and below market rents, loss on extinguishment of debt, repayments of receivables, adjustments for investment in unconsolidated joint venture, adjustments for drop-down assets and foreign currency transaction gain (loss). The GAAP measures most directly comparable to FFO and AFFO is net income.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and we define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before impairments, acquisition-related expenses, unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivatives, loss on extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on sale of real property interests, unit-based compensation, straight line rental adjustments, amortization of above- and below-market rents plus cash receipts applied toward the repayments of investments in receivable, the deemed capital contribution to fund our general and administrative expense reimbursement and adjustments for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. During the third quarter of 2019, we changed our definition of EBITDA to exclude adjustments for investments in unconsolidated joint venture to adhere to the definition of EBITDA as described in item 10(e)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-K. During the fourth quarter 2017, we changed our definition of Adjusted EBITDA by adding cash receipts applied toward the repayments of investments in receivables. We made this change to better reflect the quarterly amount of operating surplus as determined by our amended and restated partnership agreement. These changes did not have a material impact on our EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA and prior period amounts have been recasted to conform to current presentation.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded limited partnerships, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; \n \u2022 the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders; \n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and \n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. \nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Each of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. You should not consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. As a result, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nFor a further discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures of FFO, AFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA flow, and a reconciliation of FFO, AFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read Selected Historical Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results\nOur future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations for the reasons described below:\nCOVID-19\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate and development generally and those risks listed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, management and operation of our properties. However, due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, the Partnership's tenants and their operations may be impacted, including their ability to pay rent. The impact of COVID-19 on our future results could be significant and will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the success of actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19 and reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture\nOn September 24, 2018, the Partnership completed the formation of an unconsolidated joint venture (the JV\u201d). The Partnership contributed 545 tenant site assets to the unconsolidated JV that secured the Partnership's $125.4 million Series 2018-1 secured notes (the 2018 Securitization\u201d), in exchange for a 50.01% membership interest in the unconsolidated JV and $65.5 million in cash (the Transaction\u201d). The Partnership used $59.7 million of the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The Partnership deconsolidated the 545 tenant sites and real property interests and recognized a gain on contribution of real property interests of $100 million. The Partnership does not control the unconsolidated JV and therefore, accounts for its investment in the unconsolidated JV using the equity method of accounting prospectively upon formation of the unconsolidated JV.\nAcquisitions and Developments\nWe have in the past and intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of real property interests and developments of infrastructure. Our significant historical acquisition activity impacts the period to period comparability of our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Partnership completed one drop-down acquisition from our Sponsor and affiliates (collectively the Drop-down Acquisitions\u201d or Drop-down Assets\u201d). The Drop-down Assets acquired by the Partnership included an aggregate of 127 tenant sites for the year ended December 31, 2018 in exchange for total consideration of $59.9 million. The Drop-down Acquisitions are a transfer of net assets between entities under common control as the acquisitions do not meet the definition of a business in accordance with ASU No. 2017-01. The transfer of net assets is accounted for prospectively in the period in which the transfer occurs at the net carrying value. Any differences between the cash consideration and the net carrying value of the transfer of net assets have been allocated to the General Partner.\nAdditionally, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Partnership acquired 15 tenant sites, 146 tenant sites and 104 tenant sites from third parties for a total consideration of $144.2 million, $52.0 million and $75.8 million, respectively. See Note 3, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2020, we focused on the acquisition of multiple data center properties with long-term triple net leases totaling $142.8 million.\nSales\nThe Partnership's sales of real property interests impacts the period to period comparability of our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership completed the sale of its interest in the consolidated joint venture that holds its European outdoor advertising portfolio and recognized a gain on sale of real property interest of $15.5 million. The operating results of the European outdoor advertising portfolio and the related gain on sale are presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, for all prior periods presented, the related assets and liabilities are presented as assets and liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. The Partnership used proceeds from the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio and available cash to repay borrowings totaling $115 million on its revolving credit facility, including the \u00a340.5 million of British pound sterling ( GBP\u201d) denominated borrowings, and terminate USD interest rate swaps with a notional value of $145 million and a GBP denominated interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of \u00a338 million for approximately $7.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Partnership completed sales of its real property interests and investments in receivables for total consideration of $46.4 million and recognized a gain on sale of $18.0 million.\nSecured Notes\nOn January 15, 2020, certain subsidiaries of the Partnership entered into a master note purchase and participation agreement ( MNPPA\u201d) pursuant to which such subsidiaries issued and sold an initial $170 million aggregate principal amount of 3.90% series A senior secured notes in a private placement (the 2019 Secured Notes\u201d). The 2019 Secured Notes mature on January 14, 2027 and include an interest-only initial term of three years. The net proceeds were used to repay in full the 2016 Secured Notes by $108 million and the revolving credit facility by $59 million. In connection with the issuance of the senior secured notes, the Partnership obtained a standby letter of credit arrangement totaling $3.4 million.\nOn June 6, 2018, the Partnership completed the 2018 Securitization involving a segregated pool of wireless communication sites and related property interests owned by certain special purpose subsidiaries of the Partnership, through the issuance of the 2018-1 Secured Tenant Site Contract Revenue Notes, Class C, Class D and Class F (the 2018 Secured Notes\u201d), in an aggregate principal amount of $125.4 million. The Class C, Class D and Class F 2018 Secured Notes bear interest at a fixed note rate per annum of 3.97%, 4.70% and 5.92%, respectively. On September 24, 2018, the Partnership completed the formation of an unconsolidated joint venture by contributing certain special purpose subsidiaries to the unconsolidated joint venture, including the 2018 Secured Notes. See Note 8, Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture and Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOn April 24, 2018, a special purpose subsidiary of the Partnership entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which such subsidiary agreed to sell approximately $43.7 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.38% senior secured notes in a private placement (the 4.38% Senior Secured Notes\u201d). The 4.38% Senior Secured Notes are fully amortizing through June 30, 2036. The 4.38% Senior Secured Notes are secured by a segregated pool of renewable power generation sites and related property interests owned directly or indirectly by such subsidiary.\nThe secured notes described above are collectively referred to as the Secured Notes.\u201d See Note 9, Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn November 15, 2018, the Partnership completed its Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility and obtained commitments from a syndicate of banks with initial borrowing commitments of $450.0 million for five-years. Additionally, borrowings up to $75.0 million may be denominated in GBP, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. Loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR related to the currency for which borrowings are denominated, plus a spread ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% (determined based on leverage levels). As of December 31, 2020, the applicable spread was 2.25%. Additionally, under the revolving credit facility we will be subject to an annual commitment fee (determined based on leverage levels) associated with the available undrawn capacity subject to certain restrictions. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable annual commitment rate used was 0.20%.\nSeries C Preferred Units\nOn April 2, 2018, the Partnership completed a public offering of 2,000,000 Series C Floating-to-Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Redeemable Convertible Preferred Units ( Series C Preferred Units\u201d), representing limited partner interest in the Partnership, at a price of $25.00 per unit. We received net proceeds of approximately $47.5 million after deducting underwriters' discounts and offering expenses paid by us of $2.5 million. We used substantially all net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nHolders of Series C Preferred Units, at their option, may, at any time and from time to time, convert some or all of their Series C Preferred Units based on an initial conversion rate of 1.3017 common units per Series C Preferred Unit. In the event of a fundamental change, holder of the Series C Preferred Units, at their option, may convert some or all of their Series C Preferred Units into the greater of (i) a number of common units plus a make-whole premium and (ii) a number of common units equal to the lessor of (a) the liquidation preference divided by the market value of our common units on the effective date of such fundamental change and (b) 11.13 (subject to adjustments). On May 15, 2025, May 15, 2028, and each subsequent five-year anniversary date thereafter (each such date, a designated redemption date\u201d), each holder of Series C Preferred Units shall have the right (a redemption right\u201d) to require the Partnership to redeem any or all of the Series C Preferred Units held by such holder outstanding on such designated redemption date at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference of $25.00, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to, but not including, in each case out of funds legally available for such payment and to the extent not prohibited by law, the designated redemption date (the put redemption price\u201d). At our option we may pay the redemption in our common units or cash, subject to certain limitations.\nAt any time on or after May 20, 2025, the Partnership shall have the option to redeem the Series C Preferred Units, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of $25.00 per Series C Preferred Unit plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to the date of redemption, whether or not declared. See Note 12, Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nHistorically we have hedged a portion of the variable interest rates under our secured debt facilities through interest rate swap agreements. We have not applied hedge accounting to these derivative financial instruments which has resulted in the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements to be reflected in income as either a realized or unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives, except for foreign currency changes on interest rate swaps denominated in a foreign currency. In connection with the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio, the Partnership used proceeds from the sale to terminate existing USD interest rate swaps with a notional value of $145 million and a GBP denominated interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of \u00a338 million for approximately $7.6 million. On September 29, 2020, the Partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $60 million with a fixed rate at 0.18% per annum and a maturity date of November 15, 2023. On December 30, 2020, the Partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $40 million with a fixed rate at 0.21% per annum and a maturity date of November 15, 2023.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nUnder the Partnership's Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Landmark Infrastructure Partners LP dated April 2, 2018 (the Amended Partnership Agreement\u201d), we are required to reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all costs and expenses that they incur on our behalf for managing and controlling our business and operations. Except to the extent specified under our amended Omnibus Agreement with Landmark (the Omnibus Agreement\u201d), which was amended on January 30, 2019, our general partner determines the amount of these expenses and such determinations must be made in good faith under the terms of the Partnership Agreement. Under the Omnibus Agreement, we agreed to reimburse Landmark for expenses related to certain general and administrative services that Landmark will provide to us in support of our business, subject to a quarterly cap equal to 3% of our revenue during the current calendar quarter. This cap on expenses will last until the earlier to occur of: (i) the date on which our revenue for the immediately preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeded $120 million and (ii) November 19, 2021. The full amount of our general and administrative expenses incurred will be reflected on our income statements, and to the extent such general and administrative expenses exceed the cap amount, the amount of such excess will be reflected in our financial statements as a capital contribution from Landmark rather than as a reduction of our general and administrative expenses, except for expenses that would otherwise be allocated to us, which are not included in the amount of general and administrative expenses.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nCOVID-19\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate and development generally and those risks listed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, management and operation of our properties. However, due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, the Partnership's tenants and their operations may be impacted, including their ability to pay rent. The impact of COVID-19 on our future results could be significant and will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the success of actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19 and reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets.\nAcquisitions and Developments\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of real property interests from third parties and developments of infrastructure, utilizing the expertise of our management and other Landmark employees to identify and assess potential acquisitions, for which we may pay Landmark mutually agreed reasonable fees. When acquiring real property interests, we will target infrastructure locations that are essential to the ongoing operations and profitability of our tenants, which we expect will result in continued high tenant occupancy and enhance our cash flow stability. For our digital infrastructure industry, we focus on acquiring mission-critical, high-quality, network-neutral, single and multi-tenant data centers, primarily supporting colocation/cloud, wholesale colocation and enterprise tenants, in strategic markets. We expect the data center assets to have high-quality anchor tenants in place for whom the data center is critically important for its continued operations as well as leases that are structured on a long-term, net basis and contain contractual rent escalators. Additionally, we will focus on infrastructure locations with characteristics that are difficult to replicate in their respective markets, and those with tenant assets that cannot be easily moved to nearby alternative sites or replaced by new construction. Although our initial portfolio is focused on wireless communication, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation assets in the United States, we intend to grow our initial portfolio of real property interests into other fragmented infrastructure asset classes and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions internationally. The impact of COVID-19 may restrict access to construction materials and delay development projects.\nDuring 2017, the Partnership started developing an ecosystem of technologies that provides smart enabled infrastructure including stealth towers and digital outdoor advertising kiosks across North America. Stealth towers are self-contained, neutral-host towers designed for wireless carrier and other wireless operator collocation. The stealth towers are designed for macro, mini macro and small cell deployments and will support Internet of Things (IoT), carrier densification needs, private LTE networks and other wireless solutions.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Partnership entered into an agreement with DART to develop a smart media and communications platform which will include the deployment of content-rich kiosks and the Partnership's smart enabled infrastructure ecosystem solution on strategic high-traffic DART locations.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership deployed two stealth towers, 112 DART kiosks and placed in service other assets for a total of $16.2 million. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Partnership deployed nine and four infrastructure sites totaling $1.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. As we deploy these infrastructure assets, we may incur additional operating expenses associated with ground lease payments and other operating expenses to maintain our infrastructure assets. Additionally, the Partnership may pursue further development opportunities in the future. The impact of COVID-19 has at times limited access to construction materials and delayed development projects and may continue to impact the pace of developments.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture\nOn September 24, 2018, the Partnership completed the formation of the unconsolidated JV. The Partnership contributed 545 tenant site assets to the unconsolidated JV that secured the Partnership's 2018 Securitization in exchange for a 50.01% membership interest in the unconsolidated JV and $65.5 million in cash. The Partnership does not control the unconsolidated JV and therefore, accounts for its investment in the unconsolidated JV using the equity method of accounting prospectively upon formation of the unconsolidated JV.\nSales\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership completed the sale of its interest in the consolidated joint venture that holds its European outdoor advertising portfolio and recognized a gain on sale of real property interest of $15.5 million in discontinued operations. The Partnership used proceeds from the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio and available cash to repay borrowings totaling $115 million on its revolving credit facility, including the \u00a340.5 million of GBP denominated borrowings, and terminate USD interest rate swaps with a notional value of $145 million and a GBP denominated interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of \u00a338 million for approximately $7.6 million.\nMergers\nSignificant consolidation among our tenants in the wireless communication industry (or our tenants' sub-lessees) may result in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites, because certain portions of these tenants' (or their sub-lessees') networks may be redundant. The loss of any one of our large customers as a result of joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions or other cooperative agreements may result in a material decrease in our revenue. On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint completed their merger. For the year ended December 31, 2020, T-Mobile represented approximately 14% of rental revenue.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn November 15, 2018, the Partnership completed its Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility and obtained commitments from a syndicate of banks with initial borrowing commitments of $450.0 million for five-years. Additionally, borrowings up to $75.0 million may be denominated in GBP, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. As of November 1, 2019, the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility denominated in GBP was \u00a340.5 million. Loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR, plus a spread ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% (determined based on leverage levels). As of December 31, 2020, the applicable spread was 2.25%. Additionally, under the revolving credit facility we will be subject to an annual commitment fee (determined based on leverage levels) associated with the available undrawn capacity subject to certain restrictions. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable annual commitment rate used was 0.20%.\nSecured Notes\nOn January 15, 2020, certain subsidiaries of the Partnership entered into a MNPPA pursuant to which such subsidiaries issued and sold an initial $170 million aggregate principal amount of 3.90% series A senior secured notes in a private placement. The senior secured notes mature on January 14, 2027 and include an interest-only initial term of three years. The net proceeds were used to repay in full the 2016 Secured Notes by $108 million and the revolving credit facility by $59 million. In connection with the issuance of the senior secured notes, the Partnership obtained a standby letter of credit arrangement totaling $3.4 million.\nChanging Interest Rates and Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nInterest rates have been at or near historic lows in recent years. If interest rates rise, this may impact the availability and terms of debt financing, our interest expense associated with existing and future debt or our ability to make accretive acquisitions. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currencies in which the Partnership operates may impact the availability and terms of debt financing, our interest expense associated with existing and future debt or our ability to make accretive acquisitions.\nLIBOR Phase Out\nIn July 2017, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the ARRC which identified the SOFR as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. The Partnership is not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets. Any changes adopted by FCA or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR. If that were to occur, our interest payments could change. In addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in its current form.\nThe Partnership has agreements that are indexed to LIBOR and is monitoring and evaluating the related risks, which include interest on loans and valuation of derivative instruments. These risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to a new alternative rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur. The value of loans or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued. For some instruments, the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging, as they may require negotiation with the respective counterparty.\nIf a contract is not transitioned to an alternative rate and LIBOR is discontinued, the impact on our contracts is likely to vary by contract. If LIBOR is discontinued or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected.\nWhile we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point. This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. Our revolving credit facility contains fallback language generally consistent with the ARRC's amendment approach, which provides a streamlined amendment approach for negotiating a benchmark replacement and introduces clarity with respect to the fallback trigger events and an adjustment to be applied to the successor rate. We continue to monitor developments by the ARRC and the potential impact of LIBOR changes on our business.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following discussion of critical accounting policies uses we\u201d, our\u201d and the Partnership\u201d interchangeably. Our discussion and analysis of the historical financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We have provided a summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership, included elsewhere in Part IV, Item 15(a)(1). We have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial condition and results of operations. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those of other companies.\nA critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. Generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by the users of our financial statements in their evaluation of our performance. Of the accounting policies discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership, included in Part IV, Item 15(a)(1), the accounting policies presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies.\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisitions\nThe Partnership applies the asset acquisition method to all acquired investments of real property interests for transactions that meet the definition of an asset acquisition. The purchase consideration of the real property interests is allocated to the acquired tangible asset, such as land and building, and the identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of perpetual and limited life easements, above-market and below-market leases and in-place leases, based in each case on their fair values. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using the discounted cash flow valuation method. In certain instances, such as data center acquisitions, the sales comparison approach is used to determine the fair value of the land assets, the cost approach to determine the fair value of the building and site improvements, and the income approach to determine the fair value of the real property interest and liability assumed. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, the Partnership estimates the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future cash flows. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized.\nFactors considered in estimating the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired include information obtained about each asset as a result of Landmark's pre-acquisition due diligence and its marketing and leasing activities. In order to calculate the estimated in-place lease value, we employed the income approach in accordance with ASC 805 by multiplying the anticipated market absorption period by the market rent at the time of acquisition for each in-place lease agreement. Based on our experience in the industry, we have determined a range of lease execution timelines to be between one and twelve months. For the in-place lease valuation, we consider a lease-up period of four to eight months to be representative of the market.\nWe estimated the fair value of real property interests using the income approach. The discount rates used ranged from 6% to 20% with a weighted average discount rate of 8.5%. In certain instances, such as data center acquisitions, the sales comparison approach is used to determine the fair value of the land assets, the cost approach to determine the fair value of the building and site improvements, and the income approach to\ndetermine the fair value of the real property interest and liability assumed. The value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in-place tenant lease value for the real estate acquired as such value and its consequence to amortization expense is materially consistent with the in-place lease value for these particular acquisitions. Should future acquisitions of real property interests result in allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships, an amount would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationship. The value of in-place leases and customer relationship is amortized to expense over the estimated period the tenant is expected to be leasing the site under the existing terms which typically range from 2 to 20 years. If a tenant lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be impaired.\nThe discount rate associated with each asset varies based on the location of an asset (including demographics and zoning restrictions), and other asset specific characteristics. Market rent for each asset is determined based on location of each asset, asset type, zoning restrictions, ground space necessary for the tenant's equipment, remaining site capacity, visibility (specifically for billboards), and nearby sites.\nIn allocating the purchase consideration of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired asset, above-market, below-market and in-place lease values are calculated based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over the estimated period the tenant is expected to be leasing the site under the above or below-market terms. The capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as a decrease or increase, respectively, to rental income over the estimated period the tenant is expected to be leasing the site. Wireless communication and outdoor advertising tenant leases obtained by us through acquisition of real property interests are generally cancellable, upon 30 to 180 days' notice by the tenants, with no significant penalty. Digital infrastructure and renewable power generation tenant leases are generally non-cancellable. With respect to below-market leases, consideration is given to any below-market renewal periods. However, for wireless communication assets, we estimated the above- or below-market lease value over an analysis period of the earlier of the lease expiration or 10 years based on estimated useful life of the underlying equipment and assets. For outdoor advertising assets, we estimated the above- or below-market lease value over an analysis period of the earlier of the lease expiration or 20 years, based on a longer estimated useful life of 20 years for outdoor advertising assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Development Projects\nWe assess the carrying values of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future net cash flow, undiscounted and without interest, expected to be generated by the asset.\nIn evaluating our assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change, as well as other factors. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including the income approach using a market discount rate, terminal capitalization rate and rental rate assumptions, or on the sales comparison approach to similar assets. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flow, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our assets that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairments of our assets.\nDevelopment projects and other similar contracts are also assessed to determine whether it continues to meet our investment return standards. Assessments are made separately for each project on a quarterly basis and are affected by the following factors relative to the market in which the asset is located, among others: estimated development and construction costs and projected profitability. When a decision is made to cease construction on certain projects due to market conditions and/or fluctuations in our development strategy, we write off the related capitalized costs, including pre-construction costs. Based on the results of our assessments, there were no construction in progress impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized impairment charges related to certain construction in progress of $1.6 million and included in impairment in our consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Partnership recognizes rental income under operating leases, including rental abatements, lease incentives and contractual fixed increases, if any, from tenants under lease arrangements with minimum fixed and determinable increases on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the related leases when collectability is reasonably assured. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are recorded as deferred rent assets. The excess of rent payments collected over amounts recognized contractually due pursuant to the underlying lease are recorded as prepaid rents. The Partnership accounts for and presents tenant reimbursements as a component of rental revenue in our consolidated income statements in accordance with the new lease standard ( ASC 842\u201d). Tenant reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant's obligation to reimburse us arises.\nLeases obtained by the Partnership through its acquisition and ownership of real property interests are generally cancelable upon 30-180 days' notice by the tenants with no significant penalty. The Partnership evaluates whether the lease arrangements economically compel the tenant to not cancel the lease in determining the term of the lease by considering various factors such as cancellation rights, availability of alternative sites, and historical cancellation rates. For cancellable leases where the tenant is not economically compelled to continue the lease, the term of the lease is considered to be the non-cancellable period with rental abatements and contractual fixed rate increases recorded in the period the amounts become due and payable. Leases obtained through development projects, are generally non-cancellable for the initial term.\n \u2022 Wireless Communication - As a result of various factors, including the cancellation rights, ability to find alternative sites, credit risk, and historical cancellation and lease amendment rates, the lease term is generally considered to be the non-cancellable term of the lease of 30 to 180 days. For these leases, rental abatements and contractual fixed increases are recorded in the period the amounts become due and payable. \n \u2022 Digital Infrastructure - The lease term is generally non-cancellable. \n \u2022 Outdoor Advertising and Renewable Power Generation - The lease term is generally considered to be the non-cancellable term of the remaining portion of the existing term of the lease. \nThe capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as a decrease or increase, respectively, to rental income over the estimated period the tenant is expected to be leasing the site.\nOur ability to accurately estimate the term of our tenant leases is critical to the amount of revenue we recognize.\nResults of Operations of our Partnership\nSegments\nIn connection with the sale of our European outdoor advertising portfolio, an evaluation of segment reporting thresholds resulted in changes in our segment presentation for all prior periods presented. As of June 30, 2020, we conduct business through four reportable business segments: Wireless Communication, Digital Infrastructure, Outdoor Advertising and Renewable Power Generation. Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are commonly managed, as all four businesses require similar marketing and business strategies. We evaluate our segments based on revenue because substantially all of our tenant lease arrangements are triple net or effectively triple net. We believe this measure provides investors relevant and useful information because it is presented on an unlevered basis.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations for all periods presented were affected by the sale of the European outdoor advertising portfolio on June 17, 2020, other asset sales in 2019, formation of the unconsolidated JV on September 24, 2018, and acquisitions made during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 1,986 and 2,025 available tenant sites, respectively.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2020 to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated statements of operations for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td>

primarily due to $3.6 million increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 attributable to digital infrastructure acquisitions in 2020 and $1.8 million increase attributable to the full year of rental revenue in 2020 for tenant sites acquired during 2019, offset by $0.3 million of decline in outdoor advertising rental revenue. Revenue generated in 2020 from our wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation segments was $25.7 million, $9.9, million, $15.2 million and $8.1 million or 43%, 17%, 26% and 14% of total rental revenue, respectively, compared to $25.5 million, $4.2 million, $15.5 million and $8.5 million or 47%, 8%, 29% and 16% of total rental revenue, respectively, during 2019. The occupancy rates in our wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation segments were 92%, 100%, 96% and 100%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 compared to 93%, 100%, 97% and 100%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, our effective monthly rental rates per tenant site for wireless communication, digital infrastructure, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation segments were $2,013, $82,006, $1,907 and $9,611, respectively, during 2020 compared to $1,953, $62,761, $1,953 and $9,214, respectively, during 2019.\nProperty Operating\nProperty operating expenses increased $0.4 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in rent expense on assets subject to a ground lease payment. Substantially all of our tenant sites are leased to tenants under triple net or effectively triple net lease arrangements, which require the tenant or the underlying property owner to pay all utilities, property taxes, insurance and repair and maintenance costs. As we deploy our smart enabled infrastructure solutions and other projects, we may incur additional operating expenses associated with ground lease payments and other operating expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $0.5 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in legal related expenses. Under our Amended Partnership Agreement, we are required to reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all costs and expenses that they incur on our behalf for managing and controlling our business and operations. Except to the extent specified under our Omnibus Agreement, our general partner determines the amount of these expenses and such determinations must be made in good faith under the terms of the Amended Partnership Agreement. On January 30, 2019, we amended the Omnibus Agreement and agreed to reimburse Landmark for expenses related to certain general and administrative services that Landmark will provide to us in support of our business, subject to a quarterly cap equal to 3% of our revenue during the current calendar quarter. Under the amended Omnibus Agreement, this cap on expenses will last until the earlier to occur of: (i) the date on which our revenue for the immediately preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeded $120 million and (ii) November 19, 2021. The full amount of general and administrative expenses incurred is reflected on our income statements and the amount in excess of the cap that is reimbursed is reflected on our financial statements as a capital contribution from Sponsor rather than as a reduction of our general and administrative expenses, except for expenses that would otherwise be allocated to us, which are not included in the amount of general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Landmark reimbursed us $3.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, for expenses related to certain general and administrative expenses that exceeded the cap. Included in the total general and expenses reimbursement from Sponsor is $0.3 million, respectively, of management fees related to our unconsolidated joint venture that is not subject to the cap and is treated as a capital contribution from Sponsor. Additionally, indemnification of $0.4 million related to property taxes is included in capital contributions from Sponsor on the Consolidated Statements of Equity and Mezzanine Equity for 2019.\nAcquisition-Related\nAcquisition-related expenses are third party fees and expenses related to acquiring an asset and include survey, title, legal and other items as well as legal and financial advisor expenses associated with business acquisitions or unsuccessful asset acquisitions.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $3.0 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of acquisitions and the deployment of two stealth towers, 112 DART kiosks and other assets placed in service in 2020.\nImpairments\nImpairments decreased $2.0 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to five lease terminations and one non-lease renewal in our wireless and outdoor advertising segments for $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to impairment charges related to certain construction in progress contracts and eight lease terminations in our wireless communication and outdoor advertising segments for $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest and Other Income\nInterest and other income decreased $0.1 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of the sale of investments in receivables during the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income on receivables is generated from our wireless communication, outdoor advertising, and renewable power generation segments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $0.2 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower interest rates during 2020 compared to 2019.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2019 Secured Notes, the Partnership repaid in full the 2016 Secured Notes by $108 million. The unamortized balance of the deferred loan costs totaling $1.2 million and a $1.0 million make-whole payment were recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nUnrealized Loss on Derivatives\nWe mitigated exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on existing variable rate debt by entering into swap contracts that fixed the floating LIBOR rate. These interest rate swap agreements extend through and beyond the term of the Partnership's existing credit facility. The swap contracts were adjusted to fair value at each period end. The unrealized loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 and unrealized loss for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflects the change in fair value of these"}
