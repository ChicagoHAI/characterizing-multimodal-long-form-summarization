MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following section contains statements that are not statements of historical fact and are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievement to differ materially from anticipated results, performance, or achievement, expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events, are based on assumptions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We discuss many of these risks and uncertainties at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and under the sections captioned Business\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nManagement Overview\nWe are a global, integrated orthopedic medicines company committed to improving the lives of patients with degenerative orthopedic diseases and traumatic conditions with clinically meaningful therapies along the continuum of care, from palliative pain management to regenerative tissue repair. We have over two decades of global expertise developing, manufacturing, and commercializing products based on our proprietary HA technology. Our orthopedic medicine portfolio includes ORTHOVISC, MONOVISC, and CINGAL, which alleviate pain and restore joint function by replenishing depleted HA, and HYALOFAST, a solid HA-based scaffold to aid cartilage repair and regeneration.\nTable 71: <table><tr><td>28 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur therapeutic offerings consist of products in the following areas: Orthobiologics, Dermal, Surgical, and Other, which includes our ophthalmic and veterinary products. All of our products are based on HA, a naturally occurring, biocompatible polymer found throughout the body. Due to its unique biophysical and biochemical properties, HA plays an important role in a number of physiological functions such as the protection and lubrication of soft tissues and joints, the maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues, and the transport of molecules to and within cells.\nOur proprietary technologies for modifying the HA molecule allow product properties to be tailored specifically to therapeutic use. Our patented technology chemically modifies HA to allow for longer residence time in the body. We also offer products made from HA based on two other technologies: HYAFF, which is a solid form of HA, and ACP gel, an autocross-linked polymer of HA. Our technologies are protected by an extensive portfolio of owned and licensed patents.\nSince our inception in 1992, we have utilized a commercial partnership model for the distribution of our products to end users. Our strong, worldwide network of distributors has historically provided, and continues to provide, a solid foundation for our revenue growth and territorial expansion. In 2015, we made the strategic decision to commercialize our next generation viscosupplementation product, CINGAL, in the United States by utilizing a direct sales model, initially through the engagement of a contract sales organization. Ultimately, we intend to transition the direct sales function into our company as part of a broader buildout of our commercial capabilities. We believe that the combination of the direct and distribution commercial models will maximize the revenue and profitability potential from our current and future product portfolio.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed all planned activities related to the strategic project we began in 2015 to insource the manufacturing of our HYAFF-based products to our Bedford, Massachusetts facility at a total cost of $23.0 million. These products were previously manufactured by a third-party contract manufacturer in Italy. Our main purposes behind this strategic move are to enhance our research and development capabilities with the aim of accelerating future product development and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes.\nThe following sections provide more information about our products:\nOrthobiologics\nOur orthobiologics business contributed 87% of our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our orthobiologics products primarily consist of viscosupplementation and regenerative orthopedic products. Our viscosupplementation products include ORTHOVISC, ORTHOVISC mini, and MONOVISC, each of which is commercialized in various territories worldwide, and CINGAL, which we launched internationally in Canada and the European Union in the second quarter of 2016 after receiving Health Canada and CE Mark approval. ORTHOVISC is available in the United States, Canada, and some international markets for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, and in Europe and other international markets for the treatment of osteoarthritis in all synovial joints. It has been marketed by us in the United States since 2004 and internationally since 1996 through various distribution agreements. ORTHOVISC mini is available in Europe and is designed for the treatment of osteoarthritis in small joints. MONOVISC is our first single injection osteoarthritis treatment indicated for all synovial joints in Europe and certain international markets, and for the knee in the United States, Turkey, and Canada. ORTHOVISC mini and MONOVISC both became available in certain international markets through our network of distributors during the second quarter of 2008, and the commercial introduction of MONOVISC in the United States occurred in April 2014. We are currently seeking regulatory approval for CINGAL, our second single-injection osteoarthritis product, in the United States.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td>29 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe currently offer several orthopedic products used in connection with regenerative medicine. The products currently available in Europe and certain international markets include HYALOFAST, a biodegradable support for human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells used for cartilage regeneration and as an adjunct for microfracture surgery; HYALONECT, a resorbable knitted fabric mesh for use in orthopedic and trauma reconstructive procedures to maintain the relative position of engrafted bone tissue or bone fragments from comminuted fractures; and HYALOSS, HYAFF fibers used to mix blood/bone grafts to form a paste for bone regeneration. We also offer HYALOGLIDE, an ACP gel used in tenolysis treatment that, with additional clinical data, may demonstrate potential for flexor tendon adhesion prevention and for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis prevention in the shoulder. This product is commercialized through a network of distributors, primarily in Europe and the Middle East. We believe that the U.S. market offers excellent expansion potential to increase revenue for these products, and this will continue to be a focus area for us moving forward.\nIn addition to the products discussed above, we received CE Mark approval in December 2016 for a product which utilizes our proprietary HA technology to treat pain associated with lateral epicondylitis, better known as tennis elbow. Outside of the United States, this product is marketed under the trade name ORTHOVISC-T. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2016, we submitted an IDE to the FDA to conduct a Phase III clinical trial for this treatment, and the IDE was approved by the FDA in June 2016. We also received 510(k) clearance for an injectable HA-based bone repair treatment in December 2017.\nOur strategy is to continue to add new products, to expand the indications for use of both our current and any new products, and to expand our commercial reach. The orthobiologics area has been our fastest growing area, generating 88% growth from 2012 to 2017. We continue to seek new distribution partnerships around the world, in concert with entering new markets with other appropriate sales strategies, and we expect total orthobiologics product sales to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 based mainly on increased sales to existing and new partners, as well as additional MONOVISC and CINGAL product launches in certain international countries. Additionally, if we achieve FDA approval of CINGAL, we plan to utilize a direct sales model to commercialize the product in the United States initially through the engagement of a contract sales organization with the ultimate goal of transitioning the direct sales function to our company as part of a broader buildout of our commercial capabilities.\nDermal\nOur dermal products contributed 3% to our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and consist of advanced wound care products, which are based on the HYAFF technology, and an aesthetic dermal filler. We offer products for the treatment of skin wounds ranging from burns to diabetic ulcers. The products cover a variety of wound treatment solutions including debridement agents, advanced therapies, and scaffolds used as skin substitutes. Leading products include HYALOMATRIX and HYALOFILL for the treatment of complex wounds, such as burns and ulcers, and for use in connection with the regeneration of skin. Our dermal products are commercialized through a network of distributors, primarily in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Products cleared for sale in the United States include HYALOMATRIX, HYALOFILL, HYALOGRAN, HYALOSAFE, and HYALOMATRIX 3D. We have a commercial partnership agreement with Medline Industries, Inc. to commercialize HYALOMATRIX in the United States on an exclusive basis through 2022.\nOur aesthetic dermatology product is a dermal filler based on our proprietary, chemically modified, cross-linked HA, and it is primarily commercialized in certain countries in the Middle East. Internationally, this product is marketed under the ELEVESS trade name. In the United States, the trade name is HYDRELLE, although the product is not currently marketed in the United States.\nSurgical\nOur surgical group consists of products used to prevent surgical adhesions and to treat ENT disorders. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of surgical products contributed 5% of our product revenue. HYALOBARRIER is a clinically proven post-operative adhesion barrier for use in the abdomino-pelvic area. The product is currently commercialized in Europe, the Middle East, and certain African and Asian countries through a distribution network, but it is not approved in the United States. INCERT, approved for sale in Europe, Turkey, and Malaysia, is a chemically modified, cross-linked HA product used for the prevention of post-surgical spinal adhesions. There are no plans at this time to distribute INCERT in the United States.\nWe also offer several products used in connection with the treatment of ENT disorders. The lead products are MEROGEL, a woven fleece nasal packing, and MEROGEL INJECTABLE, a thick, viscous hydrogel composed of cross-linked HA, a biocompatible agent that creates a moist wound-healing environment. We partner with Medtronic for the worldwide distribution of these products.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td>30 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther\nOur other products include our ophthalmic and veterinary products, which constituted 5% of our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. These legacy products are not a part of our core business. Our ophthalmic business includes HA viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery. Sales of ophthalmic products contributed 1% of our product revenue and sales of HYVISC, our veterinary product used for the treatment of equine osteoarthritis, contributed 4% of our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development efforts primarily consist of the development of new medical applications for our HA-based or other technologies, the management of clinical trials for certain product candidates, the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals or clearances at all relevant stages of product development, and process development and scale-up manufacturing activities for our existing and new products. Our development focus includes products for tissue protection, repair, and regeneration. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, these expenses were $18.8 million, $10.7 million, and $9.0 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to commit significant resources in the near future to research and development activities, including in relation to preclinical activities and clinical trials. These activities are aimed at the delivery of a steady cascade of new product development and launches over the next several years.\nOur second single-injection osteoarthritis product under development in the United States is CINGAL, which is composed of our proprietary cross-linked HA material combined with an approved steroid and is designed to provide both short- and long-term pain relief to patients. We completed an initial CINGAL phase III clinical trial, including the associated statistical analysis for 368 enrolled patients, during the fourth quarter of 2014 with data indicating that the product met all primary and secondary endpoints set forth for the trial. During the first half of 2015, we completed a CINGAL retreatment study with 242 patients who had participated in the phase III clinical trial and reported safety data related to the retreatment study. This initial phase III clinical trial and the associated retreatment study supported the Health Canada and CE Mark approval of the product, and the commercial launch of the product in both Canada and the European Union occurred in the second quarter of 2016. In the United States, after discussions with the FDA related to the regulatory pathway for CINGAL, we conducted a formal meeting with OCP to present and discuss our data in September 2015, and we submitted a formal request for designation with OCP a month later. In its response to our formal request for designation, OCP assigned the product to CDER as the lead agency center for premarket review and regulation. We held a meeting with CDER at the end of September 2016 to align on an approval framework and on submission requirements for an NDA for CINGAL, including the execution of an additional Phase III clinical trial to supplement our strong, existing CINGAL pivotal study data. We submitted an IND in late 2016, and discussions with CDER to this point indicate that they do not have objections to our clinical protocol design. As a result, we commenced work on this second Phase III clinical trial in the first quarter of 2017, and the first patient was treated in the second quarter of 2017. Enrollment of the 576 patients in this second Phase III clinical trial was completed during October 2017. We expect to complete the six-month follow-up for this Phase III clinical trial during the second quarter of 2018 and to submit our NDA to FDA as expeditiously as possible thereafter. We have also initiated an additional three-month extended follow-up study in conjunction with the second Phase III clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of CINGAL over this longer period, and the first patients were enrolled in this follow-up study in the fourth quarter of 2017. This extended follow-up study will not impact the timeline for submission of the NDA for CINGAL following the completion of the second Phase III clinical trial.\nWe have several research and development programs underway for new products, including for HYALOFAST (in the United States), an innovative product for cartilage tissue repair, and other early stage regenerative medicine development programs. HYALOFAST received CE Mark approval in September 2009, and it is commercially available in Europe and certain international countries. During the first quarter of 2015, we submitted an IDE for HYALOFAST to the FDA, which was approved in July 2015. We commenced patient enrollment in a clinical trial in December 2015, and we are advancing site initiations and patient enrollment activities. In the second quarter of 2016, a supplement to the HYALOFAST IDE was approved to expand the inclusion criteria for the clinical study. The purpose of this supplement is to allow us to increase enrollment rates with the ultimate goal of decreasing the time needed to complete the clinical trial. We are also currently proceeding with other research and development programs, one of which utilizes our proprietary HA technology to treat pain associated with common repetitive overuse injuries, such as lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow. We submitted a CE Mark application for this treatment during the first quarter of 2016 and received a CE Mark for the treatment of pain associated with tennis elbow in December 2016. We expect to begin enrolling patients in a post-market clinical study in relation to the CE Mark for this product before the end of the second quarter of 2018. Outside of the United States, this product will be marketed under the trade name ORTHOVISC-T. In the second quarter of 2016, we submitted an IDE to the FDA to conduct a phase III clinical trial for this treatment, which was approved by the FDA in June 2016. We also have other research and development programs underway focused on expanding the indications of our current products, including one program being conducted and funded by our U.S. MONOVISC distribution partner, Mitek, seeking to expand MONOVISC's indication to include the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis of the hip. In third quarter of 2017, we also submitted an application to the FDA for 510(k) clearance of an injectable HA-based bone repair treatment. The 510(k) clearance was received from the FDA in December 2017. In addition to other early stage research and developments initiatives we are currently undertaking, we are working to expand our regenerative medicine pipeline with a new product candidate in the form of an implant for rotator cuff repair utilizing our proprietary solid HA.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn June 2015, we entered into an agreement with the Institute for Applied Life Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to collaborate on research to develop a therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this research is to develop a novel modality for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The agreement with the University of Massachusetts Amherst was extended in January 2018, and the next phase of the research will focus on optimizing the drug delivery system with the goal of advancing a novel therapeutic candidate into clinical trials to support regulatory submission. We also recently entered into an agreement with the University of Liverpool to develop an injectable mesenchymal stem cell therapy for the treatment of age-related osteoarthritis with the goal of bringing a therapeutics candidate through clinical trials to market to meet an unmet therapeutic need.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies; Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We monitor our estimates on an ongoing basis for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.\nWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout this section captioned Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition - General\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collection from the customer is reasonably assured.\nProduct Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, which is typically upon shipment to the customer. Amounts billed or collected prior to recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenue. When determining whether risk of loss has transferred to customers on product sales, or if the sales price is fixed or determinable, we evaluate both the contractual terms and conditions of our distribution and supply agreements as well, as our business practices.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct revenue also includes royalties. Royalty revenue is based on our distributors' sales and is recognized in the same period our distributors record their sale of products manufactured by us. On a quarterly basis we record royalty revenue based upon estimated or reported sales results provided to us by our distributor customers.\nLicensing, Milestone and Contract Revenue\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue consists of revenue recognized on initial and milestone payments, as well as contractual amounts received from partners. Our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license, development, and/or supply agreements with partners for the development and commercialization of our products.\nThe terms of the agreements typically include non-refundable license fees, funding of research and development, and payments based upon achievement of certain milestones. Under ASC 605-25, Multiple Element Arrangements, in order to account for an element as a separate unit of accounting, the element must have objective and reliable evidence of selling price of the undelivered elements. In general, non-refundable upfront fees and milestone payments that do not relate to other elements are recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of standard cost and net realizable value, with approximate cost determined using the first-in, first-out method. Work-in-process and finished goods inventories include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Inventory costs associated with product candidates that have not yet received regulatory approval are capitalized if we believe there is probable future commercial use and future economic benefit.\nOur policy is to write-down inventory when conditions exist that suggest inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. We regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of inventory based on a combination of factors including, but not limited to, historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product end of life dates, and estimated current or future market values. Purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure.\nGoodwill and Acquired In-Process Research and Development\nGoodwill is the amount by which the purchase price of acquired net assets in a business combination exceeded the fair values of net identifiable assets on the date of acquisition. Acquired IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that we acquire that have not been completed at the date of acquisition or are pending regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions. The value assigned to the acquired IPR&D is determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting revenue from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to present value.\nGoodwill and IPR&D are evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Factors we consider important, on an overall company basis, that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period, or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value.\nTo conduct impairment tests of goodwill, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Our annual assessment for impairment of goodwill as of November 30, 2017 indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>33 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo conduct impairment tests of IPR&D, the fair value of the IPR&D project is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of the IPR&D project exceeds its fair value. We estimate the fair value for IPR&D projects using discounted cash flow valuation models, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in-process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed projects and in-process projects, and developing appropriate discount rates. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed an impairment review of our IPR&D projects as we reassessed our research and development strategy. We recorded an impairment charge of $0.7 million due to the decision to discontinue further development efforts needed to commercialize our Hemostatic Patch in-process development project. Our annual assessment for impairment of IPR&D indicated that the fair value of our other IPR&D assets as of November 30, 2017 exceeded their respective carrying values.\nThrough December 31, 2017, there have not been any events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or acquired intangible assets may not be recoverable. We continue to monitor and evaluate the financial performance of our business, including the impact of general economic conditions, to assess the potential for the fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its book value. There can be no assurance that, at the time future impairment tests are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets primarily include property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives. Our intangible assets are comprised of purchased developed technologies, distributor relationships, patents, and a trade name. The distributor relationships and trade name were fully amortized as of December 31, 2017. These intangible assets are carried at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the intangible assets' useful lives, which range from 5 to 16 years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure the compensation cost of award recipients' services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the underlying award. That cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. For performance based awards with financial achievement targets, we recognize expense using the graded vesting methodology based on the number of shares expected to vest. Compensation cost associated with performance grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation method multiplied by the expected number of shares to be issued, which is adjusted based on the estimated probabilities of achieving the performance goals. Changes to the probability assessment and the estimated shares expected to vest will result in adjustments to the related share-based compensation expense that will be recorded in the period of the change. If the performance targets are not achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. See Note 12, Equity Incentive Plan, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the types of stock-based awards granted, the compensation expense related to such awards, and detail of equity-based awards outstanding. See Note 16, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details related to the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for stock-based compensation.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effects of these differences are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and credit carry-forwards. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>34 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nStatement of Operations Detail\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Inc/(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td>% Inc/(Dec) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Licensing, milestone and contract revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,161 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of product revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research & development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, general & administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,878 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,668 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,937 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(731 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $10.0 million, as compared to the prior year, to $113.4 million. This increase was primarily due to the growth of our orthobiologics franchise, specifically an increase in global MONOVISC revenue and our achievement of $5.0 million of milestone revenue in 2017 for reaching a target MONOVISC U.S. end-user sales threshold set forth in the Mitek MONOVISC Agreement.\nProduct revenue\nProduct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $107.8 million, an increase of $4.9 million, or 5.0%, compared to the prior year. Product revenue increases in our Orthobiologics and Other franchises were partially offset by a moderate decrease in our Surgical product revenue. The following table presents comparative product revenue analysis by product franchise:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Inc/(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td>% Inc/(Dec) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Orthobiologics </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dermal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Surgical </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(165 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>35 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOrthobiologics\nOur orthobiologics franchise consists of our joint health and orthopedic products. Overall, revenue from our orthobiologics franchises increased $4.1 million, or 5%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The growth in 2017 reflected growing end-user demand, continued market penetration, and increased revenue from worldwide MONOVISC and CINGAL sales. The increase in viscosupplementation revenue in 2017 was driven primarily by increased sales of MONOVISC resulting from a robust and growing end-user demand. We expect orthobiologics revenue to continue to grow in 2018, led by MONOVISC revenue in domestic and international markets, including revenue from sales in India, Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan, as well as increased revenue from CINGAL internationally.\nDermal\nOur dermal franchise consists of advanced wound care products, which are based on our HYAFF technology, and aesthetic dermal fillers. Our advanced wound care products treat complex skin wounds ranging from burns to diabetic ulcers, with HYALOMATRIX and HYALOFILL as the lead products. Dermal revenue had no significant change in 2017 as compared to 2016. The revenue, in part, is derived from the agreement we entered into with Medline Industries, Inc. to commercialize HYALOMATRIX in the United States on an exclusive basis through 2022. We expect dermal revenue to increase modestly in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nSurgical\nOur surgical franchise consists of products used to prevent surgical adhesions and to treat ear, nose, and throat ( ENT\u201d) disorders. Sales of our surgical products decreased $0.2 million, or 3%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease of surgical product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in sales generated by our ENT products. Our surgical franchise consists primarily of our anti-adhesion products, including INCERT and HYALOBARRIER, and our ENT offerings, of which MEROGEL is the leading product. We are partnered with Medtronic for the worldwide distribution of our ENT products. We expect surgical product revenue to increase modestly in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to increased worldwide sales of our surgical anti-adhesions products.\nOther\nOther product revenue includes revenues from ophthalmic and veterinary products. The other product revenue increased in 2017 from 2016 due to a recovery from weak 2016 sales volume for these franchises. We expect other revenue to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily driven by continued increases in ophthalmic revenue.\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $5.6 million, compared to $0.4 million for 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of the recognition of milestone revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the second quarter of 2017, we fully recognized revenue for a milestone payment of $5.0 million under Mitek MONOVISC Agreement as a result of U.S. MONOVISC 12-month end-user sales exceeding $100 million. We expect that our licensing, milestone and contract revenue in 2018 will be approximately equal to such revenue received in 2017.\nProduct gross profit and margin\nProduct gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $80.4 million, or 75% of product revenue, as compared with $78.9 million, or 77% of product revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in product gross profit was primarily due to the increased volume compared to the prior year, while the decrease in product gross margin was due to inventory write-offs in 2017, as well as initial start-up costs associated with our insourcing of the manufacturing of HYAFF-based products to the Company's Bedford facility. We expect gross margin to remain at similar levels in 2018 with potential opportunities for improvement due to increased sales volume and manufacturing process improvements.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>36 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $8.1 million, or 75%, as compared to the prior year, mainly due to an increase in expenses for our HYALOFAST and CINGAL phase III clinical trials. We also increased our pre-clinical product development activities, including with respect to achieving a 510(k) clearance of an HA-based, injectable, calcium phosphate bone graft substitute material. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue was 17% in 2017 and 10% in 2016. Research and development spending is expected to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we further develop new products and line extensions and initiate new clinical trials based on our existing technology assets, including CINGAL and HYALOFAST, as well as increase early-stage activities for other products and line extensions in the pipeline, such as our research collaborations with the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of Liverpool.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $3.5 million, or 20%, as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily as a result of increased personnel related costs, external professional fees, and additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses for 2018 will increase to reflect the support, including CINGAL pre-launch expenses and the implementation of improved operational and financial technology platforms, required to grow our business both domestically and internationally.\nIncome taxes\nProvisions for income taxes were $14.4 million and $18.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 of 4.9%, as compared to 2016, is primarily due to the revaluation of the deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax reform legislation and an increased benefit from research and development activities. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company has recorded a reasonable estimate of the impact on the consolidated financial statements. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Company's current interpretation and implementation guidance of the 2017 Tax Act.\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the periods ending December 31 is as follows:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Statutory federal income tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>State tax expense, net of federal benefit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impact of rate change on deferred taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.9 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Permanent items, including nondeductible expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>State investment tax credit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Federal, state and foreign research and development credits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Foreign rate differential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Domestic production deduction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effective income tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had gross net operating losses ( NOL\u201d) for income tax purposes in Italy of $4.0 million with no expiration date. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements, we performed an analysis to ascertain if it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize, in future periods, the net deferred tax assets associated with our NOL carry-forward. We have concluded that the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets not otherwise subject to a valuation allowance are realizable on a more likely than not\u201d basis. As such, we have not recorded a valuation allowance at December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>37 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the normal course of business, Anika and its subsidiaries may be periodically examined by various taxing authorities. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, in certain U.S. states, and in Italy. The associated tax filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those filings relate. The 2014 through 2016 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS and other taxing authorities for U.S. federal and state tax purposes. The 2011 through 2016 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental authorities for Italy.\nNet income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $31.8 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, compared to $32.5 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily a result of increased expenses for our HYALOFAST and CINGAL phase III clinical trials and increases in personnel related costs, external professional fees, and additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts. These increased expenses are offset by increased total revenue and a decreased effective federal income tax rate as a result of the 2017 Income Tax Reform Legislation.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\nStatement of Operations Detail\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Inc/(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td>%Inc/(Dec) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Licensing, milestone and contract revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,856 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of product revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research & development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, general & administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,825 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income (expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $10.4 million to $103.4 million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the growth of our orthobiologics franchise, specifically an increase in global MONOVISC revenue, which was partially offset by our receipt of $5 million of milestone revenue in 2015 for the achievement of a target MONOVISC U.S. end user sales threshold.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>38 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct revenue\nProduct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $102.9 million, an increase of $15.2 million, or 17%, compared to the prior year.

Included in product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $1.8 million and $0.5 millions of non-recurring revenue recorded in the second and third quarter of 2015, respectively, related to a high end-user average selling price for MONOVISC products sold to our U.S. partner, Mitek, prior to the fourth quarter of 2014. Products sold to Mitek after the third quarter of 2014 are not impacted by this arrangement, which will not result in additional related revenue.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Inc/(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td>% Inc/(Dec) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Orthobiologics </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dermal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Surgical </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(385 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,320 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOrthobiologics\nRevenue from our orthobiologics franchises increased $16.4 million, or 22%, in 2016 as compared to 2015.

ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC revenue in the U.S. also increased 22% in 2016 as compared to 2015, while international viscosupplementation product revenue in 2016 increased 23% year-over-year. The increase in international viscosupplementation revenue in 2016 was driven primarily by increased sales of MONOVISC resulting from a robust and growing end-user demand.\nDermal\nDermal revenue increased $0.5 million, or 22%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase primarily reflects revenue from the agreement we entered into with Medline Industries, Inc. to commercialize HYALOMATRIX in the United States on an exclusive basis through 2022.\nSurgical\nSales of our surgical products decreased slightly in 2016 as compared to 2015. The decrease of surgical product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in sales generated by our ENT products and unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations compared with the same periods in the prior year. Our surgical franchise consists primarily of our anti-adhesion products, including INCERT and HYALOBARRIER, and our ENT offerings, of which MEROGEL is the leading product. We are partnered with Medtronic for the worldwide distribution of our ENT products.\nOther\nOther product revenue includes revenues from ophthalmic and veterinary products. The other product revenue decreased in 2016 from 2015 due to a decrease in sales generated by our veterinary and ophthalmic franchises.\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.4 million, compared to $5.3 million for 2015. The year over year decrease was primarily the result of the recognition of licensing and milestone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $5.0 million for the achievement of a milestone payment under the Mitek MONOVISC Agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we collected and fully recognized revenue for a milestone payment of $5.0 million as a result of U.S. MONOVISC 12-month end-user sales exceeding $50 million.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td>39 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct gross profit and margin\nProduct gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $78.9 million, or 77% of product revenue, as compared with $66.6 million, or 76% of product revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in product gross profit was primarily due to improvements in the overall revenue mix compared to the prior year, with increased sales of our higher-margin products as a percentage of our total product sales.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $1.7 million, or 19%, as compared to the prior year, mainly due to an increase in expenses for our HYALOFAST phase III clinical trial. Included in our 2015 results was a $0.7 million expense resulting from an impairment charge related to IPR&D that was recorded in connection with our acquisition of Anika S.r.l. The charge resulted from a decision to discontinue development of the acquired Hemostatic Patch in-process development project. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue was 10% for the years ended 2016 and 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $3.2 million, or 22%, as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily a result of increased headcount and external professional fees.\nIncome taxes\nProvisions for income taxes were $18.3 million and $17.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 of 0.3%, as compared to 2015, is primarily due to an increased benefit from research and development credits.\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the periods ending December 31 is as follows:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Statutory federal income tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>State tax expense, net of federal benefit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impact of rate change on deferred taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Permanent items, including nondeductible expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>State investment tax credit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Federal, state and foreign research and development credits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Foreign rate differential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Domestic production deduction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effective income tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in permanent items, including nondeductible expenses, was mainly due to the impact on Anika S.r.l.'s long-term deferred tax assets for the decrease in Italy's tax rate, effective January 1, 2017. The increase in the federal, state, and foreign research and development credit was mainly due to increased qualified research and development expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had gross net operating losses ( NOL\u201d) for income tax purposes in Italy of $5.2 million with no expiration date. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements, we performed an analysis to ascertain if it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize, in future periods, the net deferred tax assets associated with our NOL carry-forward. We have concluded that the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets not otherwise subject to a valuation allowance are realizable on a more likely than not\u201d basis. As such, we have not recorded a valuation allowance at December 31, 2016 or 2015.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>40 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net income was $32.5 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, compared to $30.8 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily a result of increased worldwide product revenue and improved operating profit.\nConcentration of Risk\nWe have historically derived the majority of our revenues from a small number of customers, most of whom resell our products to end-users and most of whom are significantly larger companies than us. For the year ended December 31, 2017, five customers accounted for 83% of product revenue, with Mitek alone accounting for 73% of product revenue. We expect to continue to be dependent on a small number of large customers, especially Mitek, for the majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future, even with our implementation of a direct sales model for CINGAL in the United States. The failure of these customers to purchase our products in the amounts they historically have or in amounts that we expect would seriously harm our business.\nIn addition, if present and future customers terminate their purchasing arrangements with us, significantly reduce or delay their orders, or seek to renegotiate their agreements on terms less favorable to us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected. If we accept terms less favorable than the terms of the current agreements, such renegotiations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Furthermore, in any future negotiations we may be subject to the perceived or actual leverage that these customers may have given their relative size and importance to us. Any termination, change, reduction, or delay in orders could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Accordingly, unless and until we diversify and expand our customer base, our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and size of future purchases by our largest customers and the financial and operational success of these customers. The loss of any one of our major customers or the delay of significant orders from such customers, even if only temporary, could reduce or delay our recognition of revenues, harm our reputation in the industry, and reduce our ability to accurately predict cash flow, and, as a consequence, it could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSee Note 15, Revenue by Product Group, by Significant Customer and by Geographic Location; Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding significant customers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require cash to fund our operating expenses and to make capital expenditures. We expect that our requirements for cash to fund these uses will increase as our operations expand. Historically we have generated positive cash flow from operations, which, together with our available cash, investments, and debt, have met our cash requirements. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $157.3 million and $124.8 million, and working capital totaled $193.3 million and $161.6 million, at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In addition, we have $50.0 million of available credit under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. We believe that we have adequate financial resources to support our business for at least the twelve months from the issuance date of our financial statements.\nCash provided by operating activities was $40.8 million, $24.4 million, and $39.9 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operations was due primarily to increases in accounts payable and decreases in accounts receivable offset in part by increases in inventory.\nCash used in investing activities was $12.5 million, $6.8 million, and $30.2 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was mainly the result of increased purchase of investments in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed all planned activities related to the strategic project at a cost of $23.0 million that we began in 2015 to insource the manufacturing of our HYAFF-based products to our Bedford, Massachusetts facility. Cash used in property and equipment investing activities decreased year-over-year in 2017 as the largest portion of the investment in this strategic project was made in 2016.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>41 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided (used) by financing activities was $0.3 million, ($24.0) million, and $1.1 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 was attributable to proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the $25.0 million accelerated share repurchase program initiated in February 2016 and concluded in August 2016. For a description of the accelerated share repurchase program, see Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Accelerated Share Repurchase Program.\u201d\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe table below summarizes our non-cancelable operating leases, purchase commitments, and contractual obligations related to future periods which are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017.

The lease has an initial term of ten and one-half years, and commenced in May 2007. In February 2017, we finalized the exercise of its first option under the lease to extend the terms from November 1, 2017 through October 31, 2022, including the determination of a new annual base rent of $1.5 million which is included in the disclosure above. No other terms of this lease were altered. We have an option under this lease to extend its lease-term for up to three additional periods subject to the condition that the Company notify the landlord that we are exercising each option at least one year prior to the expiration of the original or then-current term. The next two renewal options each extend the term an additional five years, while the final renewal option extends the term by six years. This schedule does not include the amounts that would be due if the company exercised the renewal options.\nAlso includes a lease entered into pursuant to which Anika S.r.l. leases its Italian facility. In October 2015, Anika S.r.l, entered into a build-to-suit lease agreement for a new European headquarters facility consisting of approximately 33,000 square feet of general office, research and development, training, and warehousing space located in Padova, Italy. This lease has an initial term of fifteen years which commenced in February 2017. The lease will automatically renew for up to three additional six-year terms, subject to certain terms and conditions. We have the ability to withdraw from this lease subject to certain financial penalties after six years and with no penalties after the ninth year. As such, lease commitments through the ninth year are included in the table above. The lease provides for an initial yearly rent of approximately $0.3 million.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following section contains statements that are not statements of historical fact and are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievement to differ materially from anticipated results, performance, or achievement, expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events, are based on assumptions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We discuss many of these risks and uncertainties at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and under the sections captioned Business\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nManagement Overview\nWe are a global, integrated orthopedic medicines company committed to improving the lives of patients with degenerative orthopedic diseases and traumatic conditions with clinically meaningful therapies along the continuum of care, from palliative pain management to regenerative tissue repair. We have over two decades of global expertise developing, manufacturing, and commercializing products based on our proprietary HA technology. Our orthopedic medicine portfolio includes ORTHOVISC, MONOVISC, and CINGAL, which alleviate pain and restore joint function by replenishing depleted HA, and HYALOFAST, a solid HA-based scaffold to aid cartilage repair and regeneration.\n 28 \nOur therapeutic offerings consist of products in the following areas: Orthobiologics, Dermal, Surgical, and Other, which includes our ophthalmic and veterinary products. All of our products are based on HA, a naturally occurring, biocompatible polymer found throughout the body. Due to its unique biophysical and biochemical properties, HA plays an important role in a number of physiological functions such as the protection and lubrication of soft tissues and joints, the maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues, and the transport of molecules to and within cells.\nOur proprietary technologies for modifying the HA molecule allow product properties to be tailored specifically to therapeutic use. Our patented technology chemically modifies HA to allow for longer residence time in the body. We also offer products made from HA based on two other technologies: HYAFF, which is a solid form of HA, and ACP gel, an autocross-linked polymer of HA. Our technologies are protected by an extensive portfolio of owned and licensed patents.\nSince our inception in 1992, we have utilized a commercial partnership model for the distribution of our products to end users. Our strong, worldwide network of distributors has historically provided, and continues to provide, a solid foundation for our revenue growth and territorial expansion. In 2015, we made the strategic decision to commercialize our next generation viscosupplementation product, CINGAL, in the United States by utilizing a direct sales model, initially through the engagement of a contract sales organization. Ultimately, we intend to transition the direct sales function into our company as part of a broader buildout of our commercial capabilities. We believe that the combination of the direct and distribution commercial models will maximize the revenue and profitability potential from our current and future product portfolio.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed all planned activities related to the strategic project we began in 2015 to insource the manufacturing of our HYAFF-based products to our Bedford, Massachusetts facility at a total cost of $23.0 million. These products were previously manufactured by a third-party contract manufacturer in Italy. Our main purposes behind this strategic move are to enhance our research and development capabilities with the aim of accelerating future product development and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes.\nThe following sections provide more information about our products:\nOrthobiologics\nOur orthobiologics business contributed 87% of our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our orthobiologics products primarily consist of viscosupplementation and regenerative orthopedic products. Our viscosupplementation products include ORTHOVISC, ORTHOVISC mini, and MONOVISC, each of which is commercialized in various territories worldwide, and CINGAL, which we launched internationally in Canada and the European Union in the second quarter of 2016 after receiving Health Canada and CE Mark approval. ORTHOVISC is available in the United States, Canada, and some international markets for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, and in Europe and other international markets for the treatment of osteoarthritis in all synovial joints. It has been marketed by us in the United States since 2004 and internationally since 1996 through various distribution agreements. ORTHOVISC mini is available in Europe and is designed for the treatment of osteoarthritis in small joints. MONOVISC is our first single injection osteoarthritis treatment indicated for all synovial joints in Europe and certain international markets, and for the knee in the United States, Turkey, and Canada. ORTHOVISC mini and MONOVISC both became available in certain international markets through our network of distributors during the second quarter of 2008, and the commercial introduction of MONOVISC in the United States occurred in April 2014. We are currently seeking regulatory approval for CINGAL, our second single-injection osteoarthritis product, in the United States.\n 29 \nWe currently offer several orthopedic products used in connection with regenerative medicine. The products currently available in Europe and certain international markets include HYALOFAST, a biodegradable support for human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells used for cartilage regeneration and as an adjunct for microfracture surgery; HYALONECT, a resorbable knitted fabric mesh for use in orthopedic and trauma reconstructive procedures to maintain the relative position of engrafted bone tissue or bone fragments from comminuted fractures; and HYALOSS, HYAFF fibers used to mix blood/bone grafts to form a paste for bone regeneration. We also offer HYALOGLIDE, an ACP gel used in tenolysis treatment that, with additional clinical data, may demonstrate potential for flexor tendon adhesion prevention and for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis prevention in the shoulder. This product is commercialized through a network of distributors, primarily in Europe and the Middle East. We believe that the U.S. market offers excellent expansion potential to increase revenue for these products, and this will continue to be a focus area for us moving forward.\nIn addition to the products discussed above, we received CE Mark approval in December 2016 for a product which utilizes our proprietary HA technology to treat pain associated with lateral epicondylitis, better known as tennis elbow. Outside of the United States, this product is marketed under the trade name ORTHOVISC-T. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2016, we submitted an IDE to the FDA to conduct a Phase III clinical trial for this treatment, and the IDE was approved by the FDA in June 2016. We also received 510(k) clearance for an injectable HA-based bone repair treatment in December 2017.\nOur strategy is to continue to add new products, to expand the indications for use of both our current and any new products, and to expand our commercial reach. The orthobiologics area has been our fastest growing area, generating 88% growth from 2012 to 2017. We continue to seek new distribution partnerships around the world, in concert with entering new markets with other appropriate sales strategies, and we expect total orthobiologics product sales to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 based mainly on increased sales to existing and new partners, as well as additional MONOVISC and CINGAL product launches in certain international countries. Additionally, if we achieve FDA approval of CINGAL, we plan to utilize a direct sales model to commercialize the product in the United States initially through the engagement of a contract sales organization with the ultimate goal of transitioning the direct sales function to our company as part of a broader buildout of our commercial capabilities.\nDermal\nOur dermal products contributed 3% to our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and consist of advanced wound care products, which are based on the HYAFF technology, and an aesthetic dermal filler. We offer products for the treatment of skin wounds ranging from burns to diabetic ulcers. The products cover a variety of wound treatment solutions including debridement agents, advanced therapies, and scaffolds used as skin substitutes. Leading products include HYALOMATRIX and HYALOFILL for the treatment of complex wounds, such as burns and ulcers, and for use in connection with the regeneration of skin. Our dermal products are commercialized through a network of distributors, primarily in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Products cleared for sale in the United States include HYALOMATRIX, HYALOFILL, HYALOGRAN, HYALOSAFE, and HYALOMATRIX 3D. We have a commercial partnership agreement with Medline Industries, Inc. to commercialize HYALOMATRIX in the United States on an exclusive basis through 2022.\nOur aesthetic dermatology product is a dermal filler based on our proprietary, chemically modified, cross-linked HA, and it is primarily commercialized in certain countries in the Middle East. Internationally, this product is marketed under the ELEVESS trade name. In the United States, the trade name is HYDRELLE, although the product is not currently marketed in the United States.\nSurgical\nOur surgical group consists of products used to prevent surgical adhesions and to treat ENT disorders. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of surgical products contributed 5% of our product revenue. HYALOBARRIER is a clinically proven post-operative adhesion barrier for use in the abdomino-pelvic area. The product is currently commercialized in Europe, the Middle East, and certain African and Asian countries through a distribution network, but it is not approved in the United States. INCERT, approved for sale in Europe, Turkey, and Malaysia, is a chemically modified, cross-linked HA product used for the prevention of post-surgical spinal adhesions. There are no plans at this time to distribute INCERT in the United States.\nWe also offer several products used in connection with the treatment of ENT disorders. The lead products are MEROGEL, a woven fleece nasal packing, and MEROGEL INJECTABLE, a thick, viscous hydrogel composed of cross-linked HA, a biocompatible agent that creates a moist wound-healing environment. We partner with Medtronic for the worldwide distribution of these products.\n 30 \nOther\nOur other products include our ophthalmic and veterinary products, which constituted 5% of our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. These legacy products are not a part of our core business. Our ophthalmic business includes HA viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery. Sales of ophthalmic products contributed 1% of our product revenue and sales of HYVISC, our veterinary product used for the treatment of equine osteoarthritis, contributed 4% of our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development efforts primarily consist of the development of new medical applications for our HA-based or other technologies, the management of clinical trials for certain product candidates, the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals or clearances at all relevant stages of product development, and process development and scale-up manufacturing activities for our existing and new products. Our development focus includes products for tissue protection, repair, and regeneration. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, these expenses were $18.8 million, $10.7 million, and $9.0 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to commit significant resources in the near future to research and development activities, including in relation to preclinical activities and clinical trials. These activities are aimed at the delivery of a steady cascade of new product development and launches over the next several years.\nOur second single-injection osteoarthritis product under development in the United States is CINGAL, which is composed of our proprietary cross-linked HA material combined with an approved steroid and is designed to provide both short- and long-term pain relief to patients. We completed an initial CINGAL phase III clinical trial, including the associated statistical analysis for 368 enrolled patients, during the fourth quarter of 2014 with data indicating that the product met all primary and secondary endpoints set forth for the trial. During the first half of 2015, we completed a CINGAL retreatment study with 242 patients who had participated in the phase III clinical trial and reported safety data related to the retreatment study. This initial phase III clinical trial and the associated retreatment study supported the Health Canada and CE Mark approval of the product, and the commercial launch of the product in both Canada and the European Union occurred in the second quarter of 2016. In the United States, after discussions with the FDA related to the regulatory pathway for CINGAL, we conducted a formal meeting with OCP to present and discuss our data in September 2015, and we submitted a formal request for designation with OCP a month later. In its response to our formal request for designation, OCP assigned the product to CDER as the lead agency center for premarket review and regulation. We held a meeting with CDER at the end of September 2016 to align on an approval framework and on submission requirements for an NDA for CINGAL, including the execution of an additional Phase III clinical trial to supplement our strong, existing CINGAL pivotal study data. We submitted an IND in late 2016, and discussions with CDER to this point indicate that they do not have objections to our clinical protocol design. As a result, we commenced work on this second Phase III clinical trial in the first quarter of 2017, and the first patient was treated in the second quarter of 2017. Enrollment of the 576 patients in this second Phase III clinical trial was completed during October 2017. We expect to complete the six-month follow-up for this Phase III clinical trial during the second quarter of 2018 and to submit our NDA to FDA as expeditiously as possible thereafter. We have also initiated an additional three-month extended follow-up study in conjunction with the second Phase III clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of CINGAL over this longer period, and the first patients were enrolled in this follow-up study in the fourth quarter of 2017. This extended follow-up study will not impact the timeline for submission of the NDA for CINGAL following the completion of the second Phase III clinical trial.\nWe have several research and development programs underway for new products, including for HYALOFAST (in the United States), an innovative product for cartilage tissue repair, and other early stage regenerative medicine development programs. HYALOFAST received CE Mark approval in September 2009, and it is commercially available in Europe and certain international countries. During the first quarter of 2015, we submitted an IDE for HYALOFAST to the FDA, which was approved in July 2015. We commenced patient enrollment in a clinical trial in December 2015, and we are advancing site initiations and patient enrollment activities. In the second quarter of 2016, a supplement to the HYALOFAST IDE was approved to expand the inclusion criteria for the clinical study. The purpose of this supplement is to allow us to increase enrollment rates with the ultimate goal of decreasing the time needed to complete the clinical trial. We are also currently proceeding with other research and development programs, one of which utilizes our proprietary HA technology to treat pain associated with common repetitive overuse injuries, such as lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow. We submitted a CE Mark application for this treatment during the first quarter of 2016 and received a CE Mark for the treatment of pain associated with tennis elbow in December 2016. We expect to begin enrolling patients in a post-market clinical study in relation to the CE Mark for this product before the end of the second quarter of 2018. Outside of the United States, this product will be marketed under the trade name ORTHOVISC-T. In the second quarter of 2016, we submitted an IDE to the FDA to conduct a phase III clinical trial for this treatment, which was approved by the FDA in June 2016. We also have other research and development programs underway focused on expanding the indications of our current products, including one program being conducted and funded by our U.S. MONOVISC distribution partner, Mitek, seeking to expand MONOVISC's indication to include the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis of the hip. In third quarter of 2017, we also submitted an application to the FDA for 510(k) clearance of an injectable HA-based bone repair treatment. The 510(k) clearance was received from the FDA in December 2017. In addition to other early stage research and developments initiatives we are currently undertaking, we are working to expand our regenerative medicine pipeline with a new product candidate in the form of an implant for rotator cuff repair utilizing our proprietary solid HA.\n 31 \nIn June 2015, we entered into an agreement with the Institute for Applied Life Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to collaborate on research to develop a therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this research is to develop a novel modality for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The agreement with the University of Massachusetts Amherst was extended in January 2018, and the next phase of the research will focus on optimizing the drug delivery system with the goal of advancing a novel therapeutic candidate into clinical trials to support regulatory submission. We also recently entered into an agreement with the University of Liverpool to develop an injectable mesenchymal stem cell therapy for the treatment of age-related osteoarthritis with the goal of bringing a therapeutics candidate through clinical trials to market to meet an unmet therapeutic need.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies; Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We monitor our estimates on an ongoing basis for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.\nWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout this section captioned Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition - General\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collection from the customer is reasonably assured.\nProduct Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, which is typically upon shipment to the customer. Amounts billed or collected prior to recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenue. When determining whether risk of loss has transferred to customers on product sales, or if the sales price is fixed or determinable, we evaluate both the contractual terms and conditions of our distribution and supply agreements as well, as our business practices.\n 32 \nProduct revenue also includes royalties. Royalty revenue is based on our distributors' sales and is recognized in the same period our distributors record their sale of products manufactured by us. On a quarterly basis we record royalty revenue based upon estimated or reported sales results provided to us by our distributor customers.\nLicensing, Milestone and Contract Revenue\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue consists of revenue recognized on initial and milestone payments, as well as contractual amounts received from partners. Our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license, development, and/or supply agreements with partners for the development and commercialization of our products.\nThe terms of the agreements typically include non-refundable license fees, funding of research and development, and payments based upon achievement of certain milestones. Under ASC 605-25, Multiple Element Arrangements, in order to account for an element as a separate unit of accounting, the element must have objective and reliable evidence of selling price of the undelivered elements. In general, non-refundable upfront fees and milestone payments that do not relate to other elements are recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of standard cost and net realizable value, with approximate cost determined using the first-in, first-out method. Work-in-process and finished goods inventories include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Inventory costs associated with product candidates that have not yet received regulatory approval are capitalized if we believe there is probable future commercial use and future economic benefit.\nOur policy is to write-down inventory when conditions exist that suggest inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. We regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of inventory based on a combination of factors including, but not limited to, historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product end of life dates, and estimated current or future market values. Purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure.\nGoodwill and Acquired In-Process Research and Development\nGoodwill is the amount by which the purchase price of acquired net assets in a business combination exceeded the fair values of net identifiable assets on the date of acquisition. Acquired IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that we acquire that have not been completed at the date of acquisition or are pending regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions. The value assigned to the acquired IPR&D is determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting revenue from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to present value.\nGoodwill and IPR&D are evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Factors we consider important, on an overall company basis, that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period, or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value.\nTo conduct impairment tests of goodwill, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Our annual assessment for impairment of goodwill as of November 30, 2017 indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit.\n 33 \nTo conduct impairment tests of IPR&D, the fair value of the IPR&D project is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of the IPR&D project exceeds its fair value. We estimate the fair value for IPR&D projects using discounted cash flow valuation models, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in-process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed projects and in-process projects, and developing appropriate discount rates. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed an impairment review of our IPR&D projects as we reassessed our research and development strategy. We recorded an impairment charge of $0.7 million due to the decision to discontinue further development efforts needed to commercialize our Hemostatic Patch in-process development project. Our annual assessment for impairment of IPR&D indicated that the fair value of our other IPR&D assets as of November 30, 2017 exceeded their respective carrying values.\nThrough December 31, 2017, there have not been any events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or acquired intangible assets may not be recoverable. We continue to monitor and evaluate the financial performance of our business, including the impact of general economic conditions, to assess the potential for the fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its book value. There can be no assurance that, at the time future impairment tests are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets primarily include property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives. Our intangible assets are comprised of purchased developed technologies, distributor relationships, patents, and a trade name. The distributor relationships and trade name were fully amortized as of December 31, 2017. These intangible assets are carried at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the intangible assets' useful lives, which range from 5 to 16 years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure the compensation cost of award recipients' services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the underlying award. That cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. For performance based awards with financial achievement targets, we recognize expense using the graded vesting methodology based on the number of shares expected to vest. Compensation cost associated with performance grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation method multiplied by the expected number of shares to be issued, which is adjusted based on the estimated probabilities of achieving the performance goals. Changes to the probability assessment and the estimated shares expected to vest will result in adjustments to the related share-based compensation expense that will be recorded in the period of the change. If the performance targets are not achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. See Note 12, Equity Incentive Plan, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the types of stock-based awards granted, the compensation expense related to such awards, and detail of equity-based awards outstanding. See Note 16, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details related to the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for stock-based compensation.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effects of these differences are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and credit carry-forwards. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations.\n 34 \nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nStatement of Operations Detail\n\nTotal revenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $10.0 million, as compared to the prior year, to $113.4 million. This increase was primarily due to the growth of our orthobiologics franchise, specifically an increase in global MONOVISC revenue and our achievement of $5.0 million of milestone revenue in 2017 for reaching a target MONOVISC U.S. end-user sales threshold set forth in the Mitek MONOVISC Agreement.\nProduct revenue\nProduct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $107.8 million, an increase of $4.9 million, or 5.0%, compared to the prior year. Product revenue increases in our Orthobiologics and Other franchises were partially offset by a moderate decrease in our Surgical product revenue. The following table presents comparative product revenue analysis by product franchise:\n\n 35 \nOrthobiologics\nOur orthobiologics franchise consists of our joint health and orthopedic products. Overall, revenue from our orthobiologics franchises increased $4.1 million, or 5%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The growth in 2017 reflected growing end-user demand, continued market penetration, and increased revenue from worldwide MONOVISC and CINGAL sales. The increase in viscosupplementation revenue in 2017 was driven primarily by increased sales of MONOVISC resulting from a robust and growing end-user demand. We expect orthobiologics revenue to continue to grow in 2018, led by MONOVISC revenue in domestic and international markets, including revenue from sales in India, Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan, as well as increased revenue from CINGAL internationally.\nDermal\nOur dermal franchise consists of advanced wound care products, which are based on our HYAFF technology, and aesthetic dermal fillers. Our advanced wound care products treat complex skin wounds ranging from burns to diabetic ulcers, with HYALOMATRIX and HYALOFILL as the lead products. Dermal revenue had no significant change in 2017 as compared to 2016. The revenue, in part, is derived from the agreement we entered into with Medline Industries, Inc. to commercialize HYALOMATRIX in the United States on an exclusive basis through 2022. We expect dermal revenue to increase modestly in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nSurgical\nOur surgical franchise consists of products used to prevent surgical adhesions and to treat ear, nose, and throat ( ENT\u201d) disorders. Sales of our surgical products decreased $0.2 million, or 3%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease of surgical product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in sales generated by our ENT products. Our surgical franchise consists primarily of our anti-adhesion products, including INCERT and HYALOBARRIER, and our ENT offerings, of which MEROGEL is the leading product. We are partnered with Medtronic for the worldwide distribution of our ENT products. We expect surgical product revenue to increase modestly in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to increased worldwide sales of our surgical anti-adhesions products.\nOther\nOther product revenue includes revenues from ophthalmic and veterinary products. The other product revenue increased in 2017 from 2016 due to a recovery from weak 2016 sales volume for these franchises. We expect other revenue to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily driven by continued increases in ophthalmic revenue.\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $5.6 million, compared to $0.4 million for 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of the recognition of milestone revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the second quarter of 2017, we fully recognized revenue for a milestone payment of $5.0 million under Mitek MONOVISC Agreement as a result of U.S. MONOVISC 12-month end-user sales exceeding $100 million. We expect that our licensing, milestone and contract revenue in 2018 will be approximately equal to such revenue received in 2017.\nProduct gross profit and margin\nProduct gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $80.4 million, or 75% of product revenue, as compared with $78.9 million, or 77% of product revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in product gross profit was primarily due to the increased volume compared to the prior year, while the decrease in product gross margin was due to inventory write-offs in 2017, as well as initial start-up costs associated with our insourcing of the manufacturing of HYAFF-based products to the Company's Bedford facility. We expect gross margin to remain at similar levels in 2018 with potential opportunities for improvement due to increased sales volume and manufacturing process improvements.\n 36 \nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $8.1 million, or 75%, as compared to the prior year, mainly due to an increase in expenses for our HYALOFAST and CINGAL phase III clinical trials. We also increased our pre-clinical product development activities, including with respect to achieving a 510(k) clearance of an HA-based, injectable, calcium phosphate bone graft substitute material. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue was 17% in 2017 and 10% in 2016. Research and development spending is expected to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we further develop new products and line extensions and initiate new clinical trials based on our existing technology assets, including CINGAL and HYALOFAST, as well as increase early-stage activities for other products and line extensions in the pipeline, such as our research collaborations with the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of Liverpool.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $3.5 million, or 20%, as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily as a result of increased personnel related costs, external professional fees, and additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses for 2018 will increase to reflect the support, including CINGAL pre-launch expenses and the implementation of improved operational and financial technology platforms, required to grow our business both domestically and internationally.\nIncome taxes\nProvisions for income taxes were $14.4 million and $18.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 of 4.9%, as compared to 2016, is primarily due to the revaluation of the deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax reform legislation and an increased benefit from research and development activities. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company has recorded a reasonable estimate of the impact on the consolidated financial statements. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Company's current interpretation and implementation guidance of the 2017 Tax Act.\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the periods ending December 31 is as follows:\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had gross net operating losses ( NOL\u201d) for income tax purposes in Italy of $4.0 million with no expiration date. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements, we performed an analysis to ascertain if it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize, in future periods, the net deferred tax assets associated with our NOL carry-forward. We have concluded that the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets not otherwise subject to a valuation allowance are realizable on a more likely than not\u201d basis. As such, we have not recorded a valuation allowance at December 31, 2017 or 2016.\n 37 \nIn the normal course of business, Anika and its subsidiaries may be periodically examined by various taxing authorities. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, in certain U.S. states, and in Italy. The associated tax filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those filings relate. The 2014 through 2016 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS and other taxing authorities for U.S. federal and state tax purposes. The 2011 through 2016 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental authorities for Italy.\nNet income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $31.8 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, compared to $32.5 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily a result of increased expenses for our HYALOFAST and CINGAL phase III clinical trials and increases in personnel related costs, external professional fees, and additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts. These increased expenses are offset by increased total revenue and a decreased effective federal income tax rate as a result of the 2017 Income Tax Reform Legislation.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\nStatement of Operations Detail\n\nTotal revenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $10.4 million to $103.4 million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the growth of our orthobiologics franchise, specifically an increase in global MONOVISC revenue, which was partially offset by our receipt of $5 million of milestone revenue in 2015 for the achievement of a target MONOVISC U.S. end user sales threshold.\n 38 \nProduct revenue\nProduct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $102.9 million, an increase of $15.2 million, or 17%, compared to the prior year. Product revenue increases in our Orthobiologics and Dermal franchises were partially offset by moderate decreases in product revenue in our Surgical and Other franchises. Included in product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $1.8 million and $0.5 millions of non-recurring revenue recorded in the second and third quarter of 2015, respectively, related to a high end-user average selling price for MONOVISC products sold to our U.S. partner, Mitek, prior to the fourth quarter of 2014. Products sold to Mitek after the third quarter of 2014 are not impacted by this arrangement, which will not result in additional related revenue.\n\nOrthobiologics\nRevenue from our orthobiologics franchises increased $16.4 million, or 22%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The growth in 2016 reflected a growing end-user demand, continued market penetration, increased revenue from worldwide MONOVISC sales, and CINGAL revenue associated with the product's commercial launch in Canada and Europe. ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC revenue in the U.S. also increased 22% in 2016 as compared to 2015, while international viscosupplementation product revenue in 2016 increased 23% year-over-year. The increase in international viscosupplementation revenue in 2016 was driven primarily by increased sales of MONOVISC resulting from a robust and growing end-user demand.\nDermal\nDermal revenue increased $0.5 million, or 22%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase primarily reflects revenue from the agreement we entered into with Medline Industries, Inc. to commercialize HYALOMATRIX in the United States on an exclusive basis through 2022.\nSurgical\nSales of our surgical products decreased slightly in 2016 as compared to 2015. The decrease of surgical product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in sales generated by our ENT products and unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations compared with the same periods in the prior year. Our surgical franchise consists primarily of our anti-adhesion products, including INCERT and HYALOBARRIER, and our ENT offerings, of which MEROGEL is the leading product. We are partnered with Medtronic for the worldwide distribution of our ENT products.\nOther\nOther product revenue includes revenues from ophthalmic and veterinary products. The other product revenue decreased in 2016 from 2015 due to a decrease in sales generated by our veterinary and ophthalmic franchises.\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.4 million, compared to $5.3 million for 2015. The year over year decrease was primarily the result of the recognition of licensing and milestone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $5.0 million for the achievement of a milestone payment under the Mitek MONOVISC Agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we collected and fully recognized revenue for a milestone payment of $5.0 million as a result of U.S. MONOVISC 12-month end-user sales exceeding $50 million.\n 39 \nProduct gross profit and margin\nProduct gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $78.9 million, or 77% of product revenue, as compared with $66.6 million, or 76% of product revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in product gross profit was primarily due to improvements in the overall revenue mix compared to the prior year, with increased sales of our higher-margin products as a percentage of our total product sales.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $1.7 million, or 19%, as compared to the prior year, mainly due to an increase in expenses for our HYALOFAST phase III clinical trial. Included in our 2015 results was a $0.7 million expense resulting from an impairment charge related to IPR&D that was recorded in connection with our acquisition of Anika S.r.l. The charge resulted from a decision to discontinue development of the acquired Hemostatic Patch in-process development project. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue was 10% for the years ended 2016 and 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $3.2 million, or 22%, as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily a result of increased headcount and external professional fees.\nIncome taxes\nProvisions for income taxes were $18.3 million and $17.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 of 0.3%, as compared to 2015, is primarily due to an increased benefit from research and development credits.\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the periods ending December 31 is as follows:\n\nThe decrease in permanent items, including nondeductible expenses, was mainly due to the impact on Anika S.r.l.'s long-term deferred tax assets for the decrease in Italy's tax rate, effective January 1, 2017. The increase in the federal, state, and foreign research and development credit was mainly due to increased qualified research and development expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had gross net operating losses ( NOL\u201d) for income tax purposes in Italy of $5.2 million with no expiration date. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements, we performed an analysis to ascertain if it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize, in future periods, the net deferred tax assets associated with our NOL carry-forward. We have concluded that the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets not otherwise subject to a valuation allowance are realizable on a more likely than not\u201d basis. As such, we have not recorded a valuation allowance at December 31, 2016 or 2015.\n 40 \nNet income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net income was $32.5 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, compared to $30.8 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily a result of increased worldwide product revenue and improved operating profit.\nConcentration of Risk\nWe have historically derived the majority of our revenues from a small number of customers, most of whom resell our products to end-users and most of whom are significantly larger companies than us. For the year ended December 31, 2017, five customers accounted for 83% of product revenue, with Mitek alone accounting for 73% of product revenue. We expect to continue to be dependent on a small number of large customers, especially Mitek, for the majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future, even with our implementation of a direct sales model for CINGAL in the United States. The failure of these customers to purchase our products in the amounts they historically have or in amounts that we expect would seriously harm our business.\nIn addition, if present and future customers terminate their purchasing arrangements with us, significantly reduce or delay their orders, or seek to renegotiate their agreements on terms less favorable to us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected. If we accept terms less favorable than the terms of the current agreements, such renegotiations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Furthermore, in any future negotiations we may be subject to the perceived or actual leverage that these customers may have given their relative size and importance to us. Any termination, change, reduction, or delay in orders could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Accordingly, unless and until we diversify and expand our customer base, our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and size of future purchases by our largest customers and the financial and operational success of these customers. The loss of any one of our major customers or the delay of significant orders from such customers, even if only temporary, could reduce or delay our recognition of revenues, harm our reputation in the industry, and reduce our ability to accurately predict cash flow, and, as a consequence, it could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSee Note 15, Revenue by Product Group, by Significant Customer and by Geographic Location; Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding significant customers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require cash to fund our operating expenses and to make capital expenditures. We expect that our requirements for cash to fund these uses will increase as our operations expand. Historically we have generated positive cash flow from operations, which, together with our available cash, investments, and debt, have met our cash requirements. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $157.3 million and $124.8 million, and working capital totaled $193.3 million and $161.6 million, at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In addition, we have $50.0 million of available credit under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. We believe that we have adequate financial resources to support our business for at least the twelve months from the issuance date of our financial statements.\nCash provided by operating activities was $40.8 million, $24.4 million, and $39.9 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operations was due primarily to increases in accounts payable and decreases in accounts receivable offset in part by increases in inventory.\nCash used in investing activities was $12.5 million, $6.8 million, and $30.2 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was mainly", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following section contains statements that are not statements of historical fact and are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievement to differ materially from anticipated results, performance, or achievement, expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events, are based on assumptions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We discuss many of these risks and uncertainties at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and under the sections captioned Business\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nManagement Overview\nWe are a global, integrated orthopedic medicines company committed to improving the lives of patients with degenerative orthopedic diseases and traumatic conditions with clinically meaningful therapies along the continuum of care, from palliative pain management to regenerative tissue repair. We have over two decades of global expertise developing, manufacturing, and commercializing products based on our proprietary HA technology. Our orthopedic medicine portfolio includes ORTHOVISC, MONOVISC, and CINGAL, which alleviate pain and restore joint function by replenishing depleted HA, and HYALOFAST, a solid HA-based scaffold to aid cartilage repair and regeneration.\n 28 \nOur therapeutic offerings consist of products in the following areas: Orthobiologics, Dermal, Surgical, and Other, which includes our ophthalmic and veterinary products. All of our products are based on HA, a naturally occurring, biocompatible polymer found throughout the body. Due to its unique biophysical and biochemical properties, HA plays an important role in a number of physiological functions such as the protection and lubrication of soft tissues and joints, the maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues, and the transport of molecules to and within cells.\nOur proprietary technologies for modifying the HA molecule allow product properties to be tailored specifically to therapeutic use. Our patented technology chemically modifies HA to allow for longer residence time in the body. We also offer products made from HA based on two other technologies: HYAFF, which is a solid form of HA, and ACP gel, an autocross-linked polymer of HA. Our technologies are protected by an extensive portfolio of owned and licensed patents.\nSince our inception in 1992, we have utilized a commercial partnership model for the distribution of our products to end users. Our strong, worldwide network of distributors has historically provided, and continues to provide, a solid foundation for our revenue growth and territorial expansion. In 2015, we made the strategic decision to commercialize our next generation viscosupplementation product, CINGAL, in the United States by utilizing a direct sales model, initially through the engagement of a contract sales organization. Ultimately, we intend to transition the direct sales function into our company as part of a broader buildout of our commercial capabilities. We believe that the combination of the direct and distribution commercial models will maximize the revenue and profitability potential from our current and future product portfolio.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed all planned activities related to the strategic project we began in 2015 to insource the manufacturing of our HYAFF-based products to our Bedford, Massachusetts facility at a total cost of $23.0 million. These products were previously manufactured by a third-party contract manufacturer in Italy. Our main purposes behind this strategic move are to enhance our research and development capabilities with the aim of accelerating future product development and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes.\nThe following sections provide more information about our products:\nOrthobiologics\nOur orthobiologics business contributed 87% of our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our orthobiologics products primarily consist of viscosupplementation and regenerative orthopedic products. Our viscosupplementation products include ORTHOVISC, ORTHOVISC mini, and MONOVISC, each of which is commercialized in various territories worldwide, and CINGAL, which we launched internationally in Canada and the European Union in the second quarter of 2016 after receiving Health Canada and CE Mark approval. ORTHOVISC is available in the United States, Canada, and some international markets for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, and in Europe and other international markets for the treatment of osteoarthritis in all synovial joints. It has been marketed by us in the United States since 2004 and internationally since 1996 through various distribution agreements. ORTHOVISC mini is available in Europe and is designed for the treatment of osteoarthritis in small joints. MONOVISC is our first single injection osteoarthritis treatment indicated for all synovial joints in Europe and certain international markets, and for the knee in the United States, Turkey, and Canada. ORTHOVISC mini and MONOVISC both became available in certain international markets through our network of distributors during the second quarter of 2008, and the commercial introduction of MONOVISC in the United States occurred in April 2014. We are currently seeking regulatory approval for CINGAL, our second single-injection osteoarthritis product, in the United States.\n 29 \nWe currently offer several orthopedic products used in connection with regenerative medicine. The products currently available in Europe and certain international markets include HYALOFAST, a biodegradable support for human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells used for cartilage regeneration and as an adjunct for microfracture surgery; HYALONECT, a resorbable knitted fabric mesh for use in orthopedic and trauma reconstructive procedures to maintain the relative position of engrafted bone tissue or bone fragments from comminuted fractures; and HYALOSS, HYAFF fibers used to mix blood/bone grafts to form a paste for bone regeneration. We also offer HYALOGLIDE, an ACP gel used in tenolysis treatment that, with additional clinical data, may demonstrate potential for flexor tendon adhesion prevention and for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis prevention in the shoulder. This product is commercialized through a network of distributors, primarily in Europe and the Middle East. We believe that the U.S. market offers excellent expansion potential to increase revenue for these products, and this will continue to be a focus area for us moving forward.\nIn addition to the products discussed above, we received CE Mark approval in December 2016 for a product which utilizes our proprietary HA technology to treat pain associated with lateral epicondylitis, better known as tennis elbow. Outside of the United States, this product is marketed under the trade name ORTHOVISC-T. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2016, we submitted an IDE to the FDA to conduct a Phase III clinical trial for this treatment, and the IDE was approved by the FDA in June 2016. We also received 510(k) clearance for an injectable HA-based bone repair treatment in December 2017.\nOur strategy is to continue to add new products, to expand the indications for use of both our current and any new products, and to expand our commercial reach. The orthobiologics area has been our fastest growing area, generating 88% growth from 2012 to 2017. We continue to seek new distribution partnerships around the world, in concert with entering new markets with other appropriate sales strategies, and we expect total orthobiologics product sales to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 based mainly on increased sales to existing and new partners, as well as additional MONOVISC and CINGAL product launches in certain international countries. Additionally, if we achieve FDA approval of CINGAL, we plan to utilize a direct sales model to commercialize the product in the United States initially through the engagement of a contract sales organization with the ultimate goal of transitioning the direct sales function to our company as part of a broader buildout of our commercial capabilities.\nDermal\nOur dermal products contributed 3% to our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and consist of advanced wound care products, which are based on the HYAFF technology, and an aesthetic dermal filler. We offer products for the treatment of skin wounds ranging from burns to diabetic ulcers. The products cover a variety of wound treatment solutions including debridement agents, advanced therapies, and scaffolds used as skin substitutes. Leading products include HYALOMATRIX and HYALOFILL for the treatment of complex wounds, such as burns and ulcers, and for use in connection with the regeneration of skin. Our dermal products are commercialized through a network of distributors, primarily in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Products cleared for sale in the United States include HYALOMATRIX, HYALOFILL, HYALOGRAN, HYALOSAFE, and HYALOMATRIX 3D. We have a commercial partnership agreement with Medline Industries, Inc. to commercialize HYALOMATRIX in the United States on an exclusive basis through 2022.\nOur aesthetic dermatology product is a dermal filler based on our proprietary, chemically modified, cross-linked HA, and it is primarily commercialized in certain countries in the Middle East. Internationally, this product is marketed under the ELEVESS trade name. In the United States, the trade name is HYDRELLE, although the product is not currently marketed in the United States.\nSurgical\nOur surgical group consists of products used to prevent surgical adhesions and to treat ENT disorders. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of surgical products contributed 5% of our product revenue. HYALOBARRIER is a clinically proven post-operative adhesion barrier for use in the abdomino-pelvic area. The product is currently commercialized in Europe, the Middle East, and certain African and Asian countries through a distribution network, but it is not approved in the United States. INCERT, approved for sale in Europe, Turkey, and Malaysia, is a chemically modified, cross-linked HA product used for the prevention of post-surgical spinal adhesions. There are no plans at this time to distribute INCERT in the United States.\nWe also offer several products used in connection with the treatment of ENT disorders. The lead products are MEROGEL, a woven fleece nasal packing, and MEROGEL INJECTABLE, a thick, viscous hydrogel composed of cross-linked HA, a biocompatible agent that creates a moist wound-healing environment. We partner with Medtronic for the worldwide distribution of these products.\n 30 \nOther\nOur other products include our ophthalmic and veterinary products, which constituted 5% of our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. These legacy products are not a part of our core business. Our ophthalmic business includes HA viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery. Sales of ophthalmic products contributed 1% of our product revenue and sales of HYVISC, our veterinary product used for the treatment of equine osteoarthritis, contributed 4% of our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development efforts primarily consist of the development of new medical applications for our HA-based or other technologies, the management of clinical trials for certain product candidates, the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals or clearances at all relevant stages of product development, and process development and scale-up manufacturing activities for our existing and new products. Our development focus includes products for tissue protection, repair, and regeneration. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, these expenses were $18.8 million, $10.7 million, and $9.0 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to commit significant resources in the near future to research and development activities, including in relation to preclinical activities and clinical trials. These activities are aimed at the delivery of a steady cascade of new product development and launches over the next several years.\nOur second single-injection osteoarthritis product under development in the United States is CINGAL, which is composed of our proprietary cross-linked HA material combined with an approved steroid and is designed to provide both short- and long-term pain relief to patients. We completed an initial CINGAL phase III clinical trial, including the associated statistical analysis for 368 enrolled patients, during the fourth quarter of 2014 with data indicating that the product met all primary and secondary endpoints set forth for the trial. During the first half of 2015, we completed a CINGAL retreatment study with 242 patients who had participated in the phase III clinical trial and reported safety data related to the retreatment study. This initial phase III clinical trial and the associated retreatment study supported the Health Canada and CE Mark approval of the product, and the commercial launch of the product in both Canada and the European Union occurred in the second quarter of 2016. In the United States, after discussions with the FDA related to the regulatory pathway for CINGAL, we conducted a formal meeting with OCP to present and discuss our data in September 2015, and we submitted a formal request for designation with OCP a month later. In its response to our formal request for designation, OCP assigned the product to CDER as the lead agency center for premarket review and regulation. We held a meeting with CDER at the end of September 2016 to align on an approval framework and on submission requirements for an NDA for CINGAL, including the execution of an additional Phase III clinical trial to supplement our strong, existing CINGAL pivotal study data. We submitted an IND in late 2016, and discussions with CDER to this point indicate that they do not have objections to our clinical protocol design. As a result, we commenced work on this second Phase III clinical trial in the first quarter of 2017, and the first patient was treated in the second quarter of 2017. Enrollment of the 576 patients in this second Phase III clinical trial was completed during October 2017. We expect to complete the six-month follow-up for this Phase III clinical trial during the second quarter of 2018 and to submit our NDA to FDA as expeditiously as possible thereafter. We have also initiated an additional three-month extended follow-up study in conjunction with the second Phase III clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of CINGAL over this longer period, and the first patients were enrolled in this follow-up study in the fourth quarter of 2017. This extended follow-up study will not impact the timeline for submission of the NDA for CINGAL following the completion of the second Phase III clinical trial.\nWe have several research and development programs underway for new products, including for HYALOFAST (in the United States), an innovative product for cartilage tissue repair, and other early stage regenerative medicine development programs. HYALOFAST received CE Mark approval in September 2009, and it is commercially available in Europe and certain international countries. During the first quarter of 2015, we submitted an IDE for HYALOFAST to the FDA, which was approved in July 2015. We commenced patient enrollment in a clinical trial in December 2015, and we are advancing site initiations and patient enrollment activities. In the second quarter of 2016, a supplement to the HYALOFAST IDE was approved to expand the inclusion criteria for the clinical study. The purpose of this supplement is to allow us to increase enrollment rates with the ultimate goal of decreasing the time needed to complete the clinical trial. We are also currently proceeding with other research and development programs, one of which utilizes our proprietary HA technology to treat pain associated with common repetitive overuse injuries, such as lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow. We submitted a CE Mark application for this treatment during the first quarter of 2016 and received a CE Mark for the treatment of pain associated with tennis elbow in December 2016. We expect to begin enrolling patients in a post-market clinical study in relation to the CE Mark for this product before the end of the second quarter of 2018. Outside of the United States, this product will be marketed under the trade name ORTHOVISC-T. In the second quarter of 2016, we submitted an IDE to the FDA to conduct a phase III clinical trial for this treatment, which was approved by the FDA in June 2016. We also have other research and development programs underway focused on expanding the indications of our current products, including one program being conducted and funded by our U.S. MONOVISC distribution partner, Mitek, seeking to expand MONOVISC's indication to include the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis of the hip. In third quarter of 2017, we also submitted an application to the FDA for 510(k) clearance of an injectable HA-based bone repair treatment. The 510(k) clearance was received from the FDA in December 2017. In addition to other early stage research and developments initiatives we are currently undertaking, we are working to expand our regenerative medicine pipeline with a new product candidate in the form of an implant for rotator cuff repair utilizing our proprietary solid HA.\n 31 \nIn June 2015, we entered into an agreement with the Institute for Applied Life Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to collaborate on research to develop a therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this research is to develop a novel modality for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The agreement with the University of Massachusetts Amherst was extended in January 2018, and the next phase of the research will focus on optimizing the drug delivery system with the goal of advancing a novel therapeutic candidate into clinical trials to support regulatory submission. We also recently entered into an agreement with the University of Liverpool to develop an injectable mesenchymal stem cell therapy for the treatment of age-related osteoarthritis with the goal of bringing a therapeutics candidate through clinical trials to market to meet an unmet therapeutic need.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies; Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We monitor our estimates on an ongoing basis for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.\nWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout this section captioned Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition - General\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collection from the customer is reasonably assured.\nProduct Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, which is typically upon shipment to the customer. Amounts billed or collected prior to recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenue. When determining whether risk of loss has transferred to customers on product sales, or if the sales price is fixed or determinable, we evaluate both the contractual terms and conditions of our distribution and supply agreements as well, as our business practices.\n 32 \nProduct revenue also includes royalties. Royalty revenue is based on our distributors' sales and is recognized in the same period our distributors record their sale of products manufactured by us. On a quarterly basis we record royalty revenue based upon estimated or reported sales results provided to us by our distributor customers.\nLicensing, Milestone and Contract Revenue\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue consists of revenue recognized on initial and milestone payments, as well as contractual amounts received from partners. Our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license, development, and/or supply agreements with partners for the development and commercialization of our products.\nThe terms of the agreements typically include non-refundable license fees, funding of research and development, and payments based upon achievement of certain milestones. Under ASC 605-25, Multiple Element Arrangements, in order to account for an element as a separate unit of accounting, the element must have objective and reliable evidence of selling price of the undelivered elements. In general, non-refundable upfront fees and milestone payments that do not relate to other elements are recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of standard cost and net realizable value, with approximate cost determined using the first-in, first-out method. Work-in-process and finished goods inventories include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Inventory costs associated with product candidates that have not yet received regulatory approval are capitalized if we believe there is probable future commercial use and future economic benefit.\nOur policy is to write-down inventory when conditions exist that suggest inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. We regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of inventory based on a combination of factors including, but not limited to, historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product end of life dates, and estimated current or future market values. Purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure.\nGoodwill and Acquired In-Process Research and Development\nGoodwill is the amount by which the purchase price of acquired net assets in a business combination exceeded the fair values of net identifiable assets on the date of acquisition. Acquired IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that we acquire that have not been completed at the date of acquisition or are pending regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions. The value assigned to the acquired IPR&D is determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting revenue from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to present value.\nGoodwill and IPR&D are evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Factors we consider important, on an overall company basis, that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period, or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value.\nTo conduct impairment tests of goodwill, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Our annual assessment for impairment of goodwill as of November 30, 2017 indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit.\n 33 \nTo conduct impairment tests of IPR&D, the fair value of the IPR&D project is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of the IPR&D project exceeds its fair value. We estimate the fair value for IPR&D projects using discounted cash flow valuation models, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in-process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed projects and in-process projects, and developing appropriate discount rates. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed an impairment review of our IPR&D projects as we reassessed our research and development strategy. We recorded an impairment charge of $0.7 million due to the decision to discontinue further development efforts needed to commercialize our Hemostatic Patch in-process development project. Our annual assessment for impairment of IPR&D indicated that the fair value of our other IPR&D assets as of November 30, 2017 exceeded their respective carrying values.\nThrough December 31, 2017, there have not been any events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or acquired intangible assets may not be recoverable. We continue to monitor and evaluate the financial performance of our business, including the impact of general economic conditions, to assess the potential for the fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its book value. There can be no assurance that, at the time future impairment tests are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets primarily include property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives. Our intangible assets are comprised of purchased developed technologies, distributor relationships, patents, and a trade name. The distributor relationships and trade name were fully amortized as of December 31, 2017. These intangible assets are carried at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the intangible assets' useful lives, which range from 5 to 16 years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure the compensation cost of award recipients' services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the underlying award. That cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. For performance based awards with financial achievement targets, we recognize expense using the graded vesting methodology based on the number of shares expected to vest. Compensation cost associated with performance grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation method multiplied by the expected number of shares to be issued, which is adjusted based on the estimated probabilities of achieving the performance goals. Changes to the probability assessment and the estimated shares expected to vest will result in adjustments to the related share-based compensation expense that will be recorded in the period of the change. If the performance targets are not achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. See Note 12, Equity Incentive Plan, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the types of stock-based awards granted, the compensation expense related to such awards, and detail of equity-based awards outstanding. See Note 16, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details related to the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for stock-based compensation.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effects of these differences are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and credit carry-forwards. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations.\n 34 \nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nStatement of Operations Detail\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Inc/(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td>% Inc/(Dec) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Licensing, milestone and contract revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,161 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of product revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research & development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, general & administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,878 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,668 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,937 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(731 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $10.0 million, as compared to the prior year, to $113.4 million. This increase was primarily due to the growth of our orthobiologics franchise, specifically an increase in global MONOVISC revenue and our achievement of $5.0 million of milestone revenue in 2017 for reaching a target MONOVISC U.S. end-user sales threshold set forth in the Mitek MONOVISC Agreement.\nProduct revenue\nProduct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $107.8 million, an increase of $4.9 million, or 5.0%, compared to the prior year. Product revenue increases in our Orthobiologics and Other franchises were partially offset by a moderate decrease in our Surgical product revenue. The following table presents comparative product revenue analysis by product franchise:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Inc/(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td>% Inc/(Dec) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Orthobiologics </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dermal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Surgical </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(165 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 35 \nOrthobiologics\nOur orthobiologics franchise consists of our joint health and orthopedic products. Overall, revenue from our orthobiologics franchises increased $4.1 million, or 5%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The growth in 2017 reflected growing end-user demand, continued market penetration, and increased revenue from worldwide MONOVISC and CINGAL sales. The increase in viscosupplementation revenue in 2017 was driven primarily by increased sales of MONOVISC resulting from a robust and growing end-user demand. We expect orthobiologics revenue to continue to grow in 2018, led by MONOVISC revenue in domestic and international markets, including revenue from sales in India, Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan, as well as increased revenue from CINGAL internationally.\nDermal\nOur dermal franchise consists of advanced wound care products, which are based on our HYAFF technology, and aesthetic dermal fillers. Our advanced wound care products treat complex skin wounds ranging from burns to diabetic ulcers, with HYALOMATRIX and HYALOFILL as the lead products. Dermal revenue had no significant change in 2017 as compared to 2016. The revenue, in part, is derived from the agreement we entered into with Medline Industries, Inc. to commercialize HYALOMATRIX in the United States on an exclusive basis through 2022. We expect dermal revenue to increase modestly in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nSurgical\nOur surgical franchise consists of products used to prevent surgical adhesions and to treat ear, nose, and throat ( ENT\u201d) disorders. Sales of our surgical products decreased $0.2 million, or 3%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease of surgical product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in sales generated by our ENT products. Our surgical franchise consists primarily of our anti-adhesion products, including INCERT and HYALOBARRIER, and our ENT offerings, of which MEROGEL is the leading product. We are partnered with Medtronic for the worldwide distribution of our ENT products. We expect surgical product revenue to increase modestly in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to increased worldwide sales of our surgical anti-adhesions products.\nOther\nOther product revenue includes revenues from ophthalmic and veterinary products. The other product revenue increased in 2017 from 2016 due to a recovery from weak 2016 sales volume for these franchises. We expect other revenue to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily driven by continued increases in ophthalmic revenue.\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $5.6 million, compared to $0.4 million for 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of the recognition of milestone revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the second quarter of 2017, we fully recognized revenue for a milestone payment of $5.0 million under Mitek MONOVISC Agreement as a result of U.S. MONOVISC 12-month end-user sales exceeding $100 million. We expect that our licensing, milestone and contract revenue in 2018 will be approximately equal to such revenue received in 2017.\nProduct gross profit and margin\nProduct gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $80.4 million, or 75% of product revenue, as compared with $78.9 million, or 77% of product revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in product gross profit was primarily due to the increased volume compared to the prior year, while the decrease in product gross margin was due to inventory write-offs in 2017, as well as initial start-up costs associated with our insourcing of the manufacturing of HYAFF-based products to the Company's Bedford facility. We expect gross margin to remain at similar levels in 2018 with potential opportunities for improvement due to increased sales volume and manufacturing process improvements.\n 36 \nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $8.1 million, or 75%, as compared to the prior year, mainly due to an increase in expenses for our HYALOFAST and CINGAL phase III clinical trials. We also increased our pre-clinical product development activities, including with respect to achieving a 510(k) clearance of an HA-based, injectable, calcium phosphate bone graft substitute material. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue was 17% in 2017 and 10% in 2016. Research and development spending is expected to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we further develop new products and line extensions and initiate new clinical trials based on our existing technology assets, including CINGAL and HYALOFAST, as well as increase early-stage activities for other products and line extensions in the pipeline, such as our research collaborations with the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of Liverpool.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $3.5 million, or 20%, as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily as a result of increased personnel related costs, external professional fees, and additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses for 2018 will increase to reflect the support, including CINGAL pre-launch expenses and the implementation of improved operational and financial technology platforms, required to grow our business both domestically and internationally.\nIncome taxes\nProvisions for income taxes were $14.4 million and $18.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 of 4.9%, as compared to 2016, is primarily due to the revaluation of the deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax reform legislation and an increased benefit from research and development activities. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company has recorded a reasonable estimate of the impact on the consolidated financial statements. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Company's current interpretation and implementation guidance of the 2017 Tax Act.\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the periods ending December 31 is as follows:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Statutory federal income tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>State tax expense, net of federal benefit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impact of rate change on deferred taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.9 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Permanent items, including nondeductible expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>State investment tax credit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Federal, state and foreign research and development credits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Foreign rate differential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Domestic production deduction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effective income tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had gross net operating losses ( NOL\u201d) for income tax purposes in Italy of $4.0 million with no expiration date. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements, we performed an analysis to ascertain if it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize, in future periods, the net deferred tax assets associated with our NOL carry-forward. We have concluded that the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets not otherwise subject to a valuation allowance are realizable on a more likely than not\u201d basis. As such, we have not recorded a valuation allowance at December 31, 2017 or 2016.\n 37 \nIn the normal course of business, Anika and its subsidiaries may be periodically examined by various taxing authorities. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, in certain U.S. states, and in Italy. The associated tax filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those filings relate. The 2014 through 2016 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS and other taxing authorities for U.S. federal and state tax purposes. The 2011 through 2016 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental authorities for Italy.\nNet income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $31.8 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, compared to $32.5 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily a result of increased expenses for our HYALOFAST and CINGAL phase III clinical trials and increases in personnel related costs, external professional fees, and additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts. These increased expenses are offset by increased total revenue and a decreased effective federal income tax rate as a result of the 2017 Income Tax Reform Legislation.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\nStatement of Operations Detail\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Inc/(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td>%Inc/(Dec) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Licensing, milestone and contract revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,856 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of product revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research & development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, general & administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,825 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income (expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $10.4 million to $103.4 million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the growth of our orthobiologics franchise, specifically an increase in global MONOVISC revenue, which was partially offset by our receipt of $5 million of milestone revenue in 2015 for the achievement of a target MONOVISC U.S. end user sales threshold.\n 38 \nProduct revenue\nProduct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $102.9 million, an increase of $15.2 million, or 17%, compared to the prior year. Product revenue increases in our Orthobiologics and Dermal franchises were partially offset by moderate decreases in product revenue in our Surgical and Other franchises. Included in product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $1.8 million and $0.5 millions of non-recurring revenue recorded in the second and third quarter of 2015, respectively, related to a high end-user average selling price for MONOVISC products sold to our U.S. partner, Mitek, prior to the fourth quarter of 2014. Products sold to Mitek after the third quarter of 2014 are not impacted by this arrangement, which will not result in additional related revenue.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Inc/(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td>% Inc/(Dec) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Orthobiologics </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dermal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Surgical </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(385 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,320 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOrthobiologics\nRevenue from our orthobiologics franchises increased $16.4 million, or 22%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The growth in 2016 reflected a growing end-user demand, continued market penetration, increased revenue from worldwide MONOVISC sales, and CINGAL revenue associated with the product's commercial launch in Canada and Europe. ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC revenue in the U.S. also increased 22% in 2016 as compared to 2015, while international viscosupplementation product revenue in 2016 increased 23% year-over-year. The increase in international viscosupplementation revenue in 2016 was driven primarily by increased sales of MONOVISC resulting from a robust and growing end-user demand.\nDermal\nDermal revenue increased $0.5 million, or 22%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase primarily reflects revenue from the agreement we entered into with Medline Industries, Inc. to commercialize HYALOMATRIX in the United States on an exclusive basis through 2022.\nSurgical\nSales of our surgical products decreased slightly in 2016 as compared to 2015. The decrease of surgical product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in sales generated by our ENT products and unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations compared with the same periods in the prior year. Our surgical franchise consists primarily of our anti-adhesion products, including INCERT and HYALOBARRIER, and our ENT offerings, of which MEROGEL is the leading product. We are partnered with Medtronic for the worldwide distribution of our ENT products.\nOther\nOther product revenue includes revenues from ophthalmic and veterinary products. The other product revenue decreased in 2016 from 2015 due to a decrease in sales generated by our veterinary and ophthalmic franchises.\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue\nLicensing, milestone and contract revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.4 million, compared to $5.3 million for 2015. The year over year decrease was primarily the result of the recognition of licensing and milestone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $5.0 million for the achievement of a milestone payment under the Mitek MONOVISC Agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we collected and fully recognized revenue for a milestone payment of $5.0 million as a result of U.S. MONOVISC 12-month end-user sales exceeding $50 million.\n 39 \nProduct gross profit and margin\nProduct gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $78.9 million, or 77% of product revenue, as compared with $66.6 million, or 76% of product revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in product gross profit was primarily due to improvements in the overall revenue mix compared to the prior year, with increased sales of our higher-margin products as a percentage of our total product sales.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $1.7 million, or 19%, as compared to the prior year, mainly due to an increase in expenses for our HYALOFAST phase III clinical trial. Included in our 2015 results was a $0.7 million expense resulting from an impairment charge related to IPR&D that was recorded in connection with our acquisition of Anika S.r.l. The charge resulted from a decision to discontinue development of the acquired Hemostatic Patch in-process development project. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue was 10% for the years ended 2016 and 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $3.2 million, or 22%, as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily a result of increased headcount and external professional fees.\nIncome taxes\nProvisions for income taxes were $18.3 million and $17.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 of 0.3%, as compared to 2015, is primarily due to an increased benefit from research and development credits.\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the periods ending December 31 is as follows:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Statutory federal income tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>State tax expense, net of federal benefit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impact of rate change on deferred taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Permanent items, including nondeductible expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>State investment tax credit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Federal, state and foreign research and development credits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Foreign rate differential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Domestic production deduction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effective income tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in permanent items, including nondeductible expenses, was mainly due to the impact on Anika S.r.l.'s long-term deferred tax assets for the decrease in Italy's tax rate, effective January 1, 2017. The increase in the federal, state, and foreign research and development credit was mainly due to increased qualified research and development expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had gross net operating losses ( NOL\u201d) for income tax purposes in Italy of $5.2 million with no expiration date. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements, we performed an analysis to ascertain if it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize, in future periods, the net deferred tax assets associated with our NOL carry-forward. We have concluded that the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets not otherwise subject to a valuation allowance are realizable on a more likely than not\u201d basis. As such, we have not recorded a valuation allowance at December 31, 2016 or 2015.\n 40 \nNet income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net income was $32.5 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, compared to $30.8 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily a result of increased worldwide product revenue and improved operating profit.\nConcentration of Risk\nWe have historically derived the majority of our revenues from a small number of customers, most of whom resell our products to end-users and most of whom are significantly larger companies than us. For the year ended December 31, 2017, five customers accounted for 83% of product revenue, with Mitek alone accounting for 73% of product revenue. We expect to continue to be dependent on a small number of large customers, especially Mitek, for the majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future, even with our implementation of a direct sales model for CINGAL in the United States. The failure of these customers to purchase our products in the amounts they historically have or in amounts that we expect would seriously harm our business.\nIn addition, if present and future customers terminate their purchasing arrangements with us, significantly reduce or delay their orders, or seek to renegotiate their agreements on terms less favorable to us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected. If we accept terms less favorable than the terms of the current agreements, such renegotiations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Furthermore, in any future negotiations we may be subject to the perceived or actual leverage that these customers may have given their relative size and importance to us. Any termination, change, reduction, or delay in orders could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Accordingly, unless and until we diversify and expand our customer base, our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and size of future purchases by our largest customers and the financial and operational success of these customers. The loss of any one of our major customers or the delay of significant orders from such customers, even if only temporary, could reduce or delay our recognition of revenues, harm our reputation in the industry, and reduce our ability to accurately predict cash flow, and, as a consequence, it could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSee Note 15, Revenue by Product Group, by Significant Customer and by Geographic Location; Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding significant customers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require cash to fund our operating expenses and to make capital expenditures. We expect that our requirements for cash to fund these uses will increase as our operations expand. Historically we have generated positive cash flow from operations, which, together with our available cash, investments, and debt, have met our cash requirements. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $157.3 million and $124.8 million, and working capital totaled $193.3 million and $161.6 million, at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In addition, we have $50.0 million of available credit under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. We believe that we have adequate financial resources to support our business for at least the twelve months from the issuance date of our financial statements.\nCash provided by operating activities was $40.8 million, $24.4 million, and $39.9 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operations was due primarily to increases in accounts payable and decreases in accounts receivable offset in part by increases in inventory.\nCash used in investing activities was $12.5 million, $6.8 million, and $30.2 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was mainly"}
