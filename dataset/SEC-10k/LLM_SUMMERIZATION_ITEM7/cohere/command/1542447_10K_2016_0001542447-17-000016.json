MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the other unaudited financial data included in this Annual Report. We further invite you to visit our website, www.rreefpropertytrust.com, where we routinely post additional information about our company, such as, without limitation, our daily net asset value, or NAV, per share, press releases and information about upcoming investor conference calls. The public may find this information on our website. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference. The terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d and the Company\u201d refer to RREEF Property Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nThe Company's NAV per share is published daily via NASDAQ's Mutual Fund Quotation System under the symbols ZRPTAX, ZRPTIX and ZRPTTX for its Class A shares, Class I shares and Class T shares, respectively.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation formed on February 7, 2012, to invest in a diversified portfolio of high quality, income-producing commercial real estate properties and other real estate-related assets. We are an externally advised, perpetual-life corporation that qualified as a REIT for the calendar year ended December 31, 2013 for federal income tax purposes. We hold our properties, real estate-related assets and other investments through RREEF Property Operating Partnership, LP, or our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner.\nWe invest primarily in the office, industrial, retail and multifamily sectors of the commercial real estate industry in the United States. We may also invest in real estate-related assets, which include common and preferred stock of publicly traded REITs and other real estate companies, which we refer to as real estate equity securities,\u201d and debt investments backed by real estate, which we refer to as real estate loans.\u201d\nOur board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, our board has delegated to our advisor authority to manage our day-to-day business in accordance with our investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations.\nOn May 30, 2013, upon receipt of a purchase order from our sponsor for $10,000,000 of Class I shares of our common stock and the release to us of funds in the escrow account, we commenced operations. Prior to May 30, 2013, we had neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues. Our entire activity from our inception date through May 30, 2013 was to prepare for and implement our public offering of our common stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we accomplished the following:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Acquired one medical office property outside of Boston, Massachusetts, for $34,000,000, increasing both our geographic and property type diversification;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expanded our Wells Fargo line of credit to a maximum capacity of $100,000,000;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintained 100% occupancy in the real estate portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Secured two fully non-recourse, fixed-rate loans totaling $27.5 million on two separate properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Successfully launched our follow-on public offering; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Raised approximately $27.6 million of new capital from investors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFurther detail on these activities is provided below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nPortfolio Information\nReal Estate Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2016, our real estate portfolio was comprised of eight properties diversified across geography and sector. Details of the properties acquired in the past three years are shown below.\n2014 Acquisitions\nOn April 11, 2014, we acquired a fee simple interest in an industrial building and an adjacent lot located in Logan Township, New Jersey ( Commerce Corner\u201d) for a purchase price of $19,750,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded\nthis acquisition with existing capital and $17,600,000 from our line of credit. Of the $17,600,000 borrowed, $8,760,000 was from existing borrowing capacity on previously acquired properties, while $8,840,000 was allocated to Commerce Corner. Commerce Corner is a 259,910 square-foot industrial building located on a 14.4 acre site at 1109 Commerce Boulevard, plus an additional adjacent 9.7 acre parcel of land which is partially utilized by one of the tenants for additional trailer parking. Situated one mile from Exit 10 of Interstate 295 and in close proximity to Interstate 95 and the New Jersey Turnpike, the northeast distribution corridor's primary north/south highways, Commerce Corner is strategically positioned at the front of the 3.1 million square foot LogistiCenter at Logan industrial park.\nOn July 2, 2014, we acquired a fee simple interest in an office building located in Anaheim, California (\"Anaheim Hills Office Plaza\") for a purchase price of $18,500,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded this acquisition with existing capital and by borrowing $14,700,000 from our line of credit. Of the $14,700,000 borrowed, $4,570,000 was from existing borrowing capacity secured by previously acquired properties, while $10,130,000 was specific to Anaheim Hills Office Plaza. Anaheim Hills Office Plaza is a 73,892 square-foot, three-story, office building located on a 4.1 acre site located at 160 North Riverview Drive in Anaheim Hills, a submarket in Orange County. The property lies 15 miles north of John Wayne International Airport with direct access to CA-91 and ease of access to the regional freeway system. We believe the property's proximity to multiple major freeways provides access to a large and diverse labor pool. The building was constructed in 2008.\nOn October 2, 2014, we acquired a fee simple interest in a retail building located in Chula Vista, California (\"Terra Nova Plaza\") for a purchase price of $21,850,000, exclusive of closing costs.

Terra Nova Plaza is at the intersection of Interstate 805 and H Street, providing access, visibility and drive-by traffic on H Street.\n2015 Acquisitions\nOn September 30, 2015, we acquired a fee simple interest in a student housing building located in Athens, Georgia (\"The Flats at Carrs Hill\") for a purchase price of $27,000,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded this acquisition by borrowing $27,000,000 from our line of credit. Of the $27,000,000 borrowed, $13,570,962 was from existing borrowing capacity secured by previously acquired properties, while $13,429,038 was specific to The Flats at Carrs Hill. The Flats at Carrs Hill is a 135,864 square-foot five-story student housing building with 138 units and 316 beds on a 14.3 acre site located at 592 Oconee Street in Athens, Georgia, just one quarter of a mile east of the University of Georgia ( UGA\u201d) campus and within walking distance from coffee shops, bookstores, restaurants and bars. Among other amenities, The Flats at Carrs Hill features a full-size indoor basketball court, multiple lounges, a 24-hour fitness center and a pool. Additionally, UGA recently approved an expansion of the North Oconee River Greenway trail, a 3.65 mile walking and biking path, which will provide the student residents direct pedestrian access to additional parts of campus.\nOn December 21, 2015, we acquired a fee simple interest in an office building located in Sterling, Virginia (\"Loudoun Gateway\") for a purchase price of $21,950,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded the acquisition with existing capital and by borrowing $20,000,000 from our line of credit. Of the $20,000,000 borrowed, approximately $8,000,000 was from existing borrowing capacity secured by previously acquired properties, while approximately $12,000,000 was specific to Loudoun Gateway.

Loudoun Gateway is approximately three miles north of Washington Dulles International Airport at the intersection of Route 28 and Old Ox Road (Route 606), providing access to a network of highways and other commuter thoroughfares that connect Northern Virginia with the broader Washington, DC metropolitan region. The greater Washington, DC metropolitan area can be accessed via four routes: Route 28, the Dulles Toll Road, Route 50, and Route 7. Dining, entertainment and shopping facilities in Dulles Town Center, Dulles Town Crossing, Dulles 28 Centre, and Reston Town Center are all within short driving distances of Loudoun Gateway.\n2016 Acquisition\nOn September 27, 2016, we acquired a fee simple interest in a medical office building located in Dedham, Massachusetts (\"Allied Drive\") for a purchase price of $34,000,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded the acquisition with cash on hand and a $32,400,000 borrowing from our Wells Fargo line of credit. Of the $32,400,000 borrowed, approximately $13,100,000 is from existing borrowing capacity on previously acquired properties, while approximately\n$19,300,000 is allocated to Allied Drive. Allied Drive is a two-story, 64,127 rentable square foot Class A medical office building approximately 20 miles outside of Boston. The property is located at Allied Drive in Dedham, Massachusetts directly off of Route 128 / Interstate 95, providing easy vehicular access to a network of highways and other commuter thoroughfares that connect to the broader Boston metropolitan region. Allied Drive is also accessible via the commuter rail MBTA stop, which services Boston in less than 10 minutes. Legacy Place, University Station, Dedham Mall and Hilton Boston - Dedham are within short driving distances of Allied Drive, offering tenants a multitude of dining, entertainment and lodging options. Newly constructed in 2013, Allied Drive was built with a full spectrum of orthopedic-related services, featuring eight state-of-the-art operating rooms, a hospital-quality post-anesthesia care unit, diagnostic imaging and ancillary service space and Class A medical office suites.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our weighted average remaining lease term was 7.1 years. The following table presents certain additional information about the properties we owned as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rentable Square Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Leases/Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Occupancy(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Heritage Parkway\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Woodridge, IL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Anaheim Hills Office Plaza\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Anaheim, CA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Loudoun Gateway\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sterling, VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Allied Drive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dedham, MA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Wallingford Plaza(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Seattle, WA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Terra Nova Plaza\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Chula Vista, CA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Commerce Corner\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Logan Township, NJ\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> The Flats at Carrs Hill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Athens, GA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grand Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>856,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19/138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Occupancy is based on executed leases as of December 31, 2016.\n(2) Wallingford Plaza is ground floor retail plus two floors of office space. The retail portion comprises the majority of the rental revenue for the property.\nReal Estate Equity Securities Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2016, our real estate equity securities portfolio consisted of publicly traded common stock of 40 REITs with a value of $8,609,212. We believe that investing a portion of our proceeds from our offering into a diversified portfolio of common and preferred shares of REITs and other real estate operating companies will provide our overall portfolio flexibility with near-term liquidity as well as potentially enhance our NAV over a longer period. The real estate equity securities portfolio is regularly reviewed and evaluated to determine whether the marketable securities held at any time continue to serve their original intended purposes.\nThe following chart summarizes our marketable securities by property type as of December 31, 2016:\nAs of December 31, 2016, our top ten holdings in our real estate equity securities portfolio were as follows:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Security\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Securities Portfolio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simon Property Group, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prologis, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public Storage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Welltower, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vornado Realty Trust\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Growth Properties, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Essex Property Trust, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarket Outlook\nCommercial real estate had a strong year during 2016. For the most part, demand continued to outstrip supply, pushing vacancy rates lower and rents higher. Commercial real estate prices generally ended the year above where they started, delivering total returns to core real estate in line with the historical average for commercial real estate. In more subtle ways, however, we believe the landscape began to shift. While fundamentals were strong, financial-market volatility curbed the decline of capitalization rates that had powered capital gains since 2010. Total annual returns on an unleveraged basis slipped into the single digits for the first time since the recent financial crisis.\nWe believe that commercial real estate will deliver a similar return profile over the next five years. Given that supply is generally moderate and shows tentative signs of peaking, we believe that real estate is positioned to generate healthy net operating income growth. At the same time, rising interest rates and temperate capital flows directly into commercial real estate are expected to put modest upward pressure on capitalization rates, slowing the pace of appreciation. We expect\ntotal annual unleveraged returns on commercial real estate will be primarily income driven, averaging 5%-6% annually through 2021 (6%-7% over the next two years).\nWhile a more normalized return profile may be disappointing to some investors, in our view it represents a soft landing that should be welcomed. We believe the U.S. economy does not suffer from overt excesses, such as inflation or asset bubbles, that have precipitated past recessions. We believe supply is generally under control, real estate is not over-leveraged and valuations are not stretched on a relative basis. In this context, a moderation of returns should help extend the duration of the cycle, or in a worst case scenario, cushion the severity of any downturn, which we continue to believe is several years off.\nResults of Operations\nWe commenced operations on May 30, 2013 upon receipt of $10,000,000 in proceeds from our sponsor in our initial public offering. On May 31, 2013, we acquired our first property and made our initial investments in marketable securities. Since then and through December 31, 2016, we acquired seven additional properties and significantly increased our outstanding debt balance as described above under \"Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio.\" In addition, we expect to continue to raise additional capital, increase our borrowings and make future acquisitions, which we believe will have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenues\nOur rental income increased to $15,102,464 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $8,050,514 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our tenant reimbursement income increased to $1,514,772 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $1,066,073 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our 2016 rental and tenant reimbursement income increased from 2015 due to the property acquisitions occurring during 2015 and 2016 as described above under \"Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio.\" Also included in our 2016 rental and tenant reimbursement income is approximately $1,499,234 related to the fully amortized below market lease liability at Terra Nova Plaza for The Sports Authority, Inc. In connection with the bankruptcy proceedings of The Sports Authority, Inc., on June 29, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. won the right at auction to assume and/or negotiate a new lease for the space at Terra Nova Plaza occupied by The Sports Authority, Inc. In September 2016, we executed a 10-year lease with Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., which was subsequently approved by the bankruptcy court on September 26, 2016 at which time Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. became the tenant, effectively terminating the lease with The Sports Authority, Inc. At such time, all remaining lease intangibles related to The Sports Authority, Inc. were fully amortized through the lease termination date.\nStraight line revenues increased to $836,108 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $431,065 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in straight line revenues for 2016 over 2015 was due to our additional property acquisitions. Typically, our leases have contractual base rent increases, which cause corresponding decreases in the straight line rent adjustments once effective. In addition, we recognized approximately $264,000 of straight line revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the lease with Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., a result of the lease beginning in September 2016 but cash base rent not commencing until March 1, 2017.\nHeritage Parkway, Wallingford Plaza, Commerce Corner, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza and Terra Nova Plaza represent our same-store real estate investments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, being the properties owned for the entirety of both periods. For those properties, property income was up $1,622,000 in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to $1,499,234 from the full amortization of the below market lease liability related to the termination of the lease with The Sports Authority, Inc. as described above. Base rental income had a minimal change over the prior period as contractual base rent increases at the properties were offset by three months of free rent at Terra Nova Plaza related to the lease with Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. Straight line revenue increased by approximately $125,000, primarily a result of the $264,000 recognized from the Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. lease offsetting decreases from the other properties. In addition, the 2016 period saw increased tenant reimbursements of approximately $57,000 primarily related similar increases in recoverable operating expenses.\nOur investment income on marketable securities increased to $484,912 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $284,627 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in investment income was due to certain securities providing greater distributions in 2016 as a result of asset sales. Such greater distributions may not continue in future periods. The portfolio is regularly adjusted by increasing and decreasing specific holdings primarily based upon\nchanges in sector allocations and to a lesser degree based upon performance of specific securities. Proceeds from sale of securities are primarily reinvested in the common stock of other publicly traded REITs, thereby keeping a base of investments that generate dividend income. As of December 31, 2016, our real estate equity securities portfolio had a total investment cost of $8,103,761. All of our investment income on marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was comprised of dividend income from these investments.\nExpenses\nOur total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $19,214,799 and $10,310,944, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses were $2,091,416 and $2,012,137, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses include a variety of corporate expenses, the largest of which were audit fees, legal fees, professional fees, directors and officers insurance and independent director compensation. The amount for the 2016 period is higher than 2015 primarily due to higher audit fees and other professional fees related to tax and compliance.\nProperty operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $5,158,942 and $2,118,849, respectively. The increase in property operating expenses from 2015 to 2016 is primarily due to the 2015 property acquisitions occurring late in the year as described above under \"Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio.\" In addition, we recognized approximately $545,000 of bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the bankruptcy filing of The Sports Authority, Inc. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, depreciation was $3,826,198 and $2,233,667, respectively and amortization was $6,803,850 and $2,735,138, respectively. Depreciation and amortization also increased in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period as a result of the additional acquisitions. Furthermore, the 2016 period includes $1,898,000 in amortization expense due to the full amortization of the acquired intangible lease assets related to The Sports Authority, Inc. lease.\nOn a same-store basis (for Heritage Parkway, Wallingford Plaza, Commerce Corner, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza and Terra Nova Plaza), property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by approximately $628,000 compared to the same period of 2015 primarily due to $545,000 of bad debt expense and, to a lesser degree, legal costs, at Terra Nova Plaza related to the bankruptcy of The Sports Authority, Inc. In addition, we recognized increased real estate taxes of approximately $40,000, primarily related to Commerce Corner. On a same-store basis, amortization increased approximately $1,854,000, primarily due to the additional amortization related to The Sports Authority Inc. lease as noted above, however, depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe fixed component of the advisory fee is equal to 1% per annum of the NAV for each share class and is calculated and accrued daily and reflected in our NAV per share. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fixed component of the advisory fee was $900,726 and $607,614, respectively. The fixed component of the advisory fee was not earned by our advisor until our combined NAV for all share classes reached $50,000,000, which occurred on January 22, 2015. The increase in the fixed component of the advisory fee is due to the additional capital raised during 2016 as well as an increase to our NAV resulting from appreciation of our real estate investments.\nIn accordance with our advisory agreement, our advisor can earn the performance component of the advisory fee when the total return to stockholders exceeds a required 6% per annum hurdle. The performance component is calculated separately for each share class and is comprised of the distributions paid to stockholders in each share class combined with the change in price of each share class. The performance component of the advisory fee for each share class is equal to 25% of the excess total return (the portion above the 6% per annum hurdle) allocable to such class; provided that in no event will the performance component exceed 10% of the aggregate total return allocable to such class for such year. The performance component of the advisory fee is payable annually based on the results for the entire calendar year. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the performance component exceeded the 6% per annum hurdle for at least one of the share classes. However, our advisor waived the performance component of the advisory fee for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the performance component of the advisory fee was $274,905. The actual performance component that our advisor could earn in the future depends on several factors, including but not limited to the performance of our investments, our expenses and interest rates.\nAcquisition related expenses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $158,762 and $603,539, respectively. The 2016 amount related to our acquisition of Allied Drive and the 2015 amount related primarily to our acquisitions of The Flats at Carrs Hill and Loudoun Gateway. Acquisition related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 also included costs related to pursuit of acquisitions that we ultimately decided not to complete.\nWe expect our acquisition related expenses, depreciation, amortization and property operating expenses to increase in future periods because we anticipate acquiring additional properties in the future.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense was $2,427,110 compared to $1,330,601 for the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to a greater weighted average outstanding aggregate loan balance due to additional borrowings on our line of credit related to acquisitions which occurred in the second half of 2015 and late 2016. The weighted average outstanding balance on our line of credit was $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our weighted average balance on our line of credit was attributable to our ownership of a greater number of properties during 2016 as compared to 2015. Additionally contributing to the increased interest expense in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period is the long term property specific loans that were originated in 2016. On March 1, 2016, we originated a $14,500,000 loan for The Flats at Carrs Hill which has a fixed interest rate of 3.63%. In addition, on December 1, 2016, we originated a $13,000,000 loan for Commerce Corner which has a fixed interest rate of 3.41%. Interest expense is greater from these loans as the interest rates are slightly higher than the 2.1% - 2.4% interest rate on the Wells Fargo line of credit, and there is additional amortization of financing costs associated with these fixed rate loans. Lastly, the increase in overall interest expense from 2015 to 2016 was partly due to the imputation of interest of $209,772 on our note to affiliate. Because we reached our maximum expense support of $9,200,000 from our advisor as of December 31, 2015, the repayment provisions of the expense support agreement were triggered in January 2016, causing us to impute interest on the payment stream. We expect our interest expense to increase in future periods because we anticipate acquiring additional properties with borrowings in the future. However, as we acquire additional properties and finance a portion of those properties with borrowings under our line of credit, we expect our line of credit fees to decrease. In addition, we anticipate utilizing additional property specific debt as a form of permanent financing along with continuing to use the line of credit to acquire additional properties.\nRealized and Unrealized Losses from Marketable Securities\nOur portfolio of investments in publicly-traded REIT securities is subject to continual adjustments in positions held as the portfolio is actively managed among different sectors. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, these portfolio refinements resulted in net realized gains of $193,285 and $12,635, respectively. During 2016, the REIT securities market generally gained ground during the first half, followed by a somewhat negative second half of the year due to expectations of a rise in interest rates as well as the uncertainty of the presidential election. During 2015, the REIT stock sector declined generally, primarily as a result of interest rate fears, the Greek debt situation and a slowing Chinese economy, although by the end of 2015, these fears had tempered and the public REIT sector finished the year by recovering the losses and adding further gains resulting in unrealized gains. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2016, our securities portfolio experienced a net unrealized loss of $189,989, while the year ended December 31, 2015 experienced a net unrealized gain of $105,958. As of December 31, 2016, we owned a portfolio of publicly traded common stock of 40 REITs with a cost basis of $8,103,761 and a fair value of $8,609,212, reflecting a net unrealized gain of $505,451.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nOur rental income increased to $8,050,514 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4,591,711 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our tenant reimbursement income increased to $1,066,073 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $593,845 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our 2015 rental and tenant reimbursement income increased from 2014 due to the property acquisitions occurring during 2014 and 2015 as described above under \"Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio.\" Straight line revenues increased to $431,065 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $342,643 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in straight line revenues for 2015 over 2014 is reflective of our additional property acquisitions.\nWallingford Plaza and Heritage Parkway represent our only same-store real estate investments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, being the only properties owned for the entirety of the periods. For those properties, other property income was down $40,000 in 2015 compared to 2014, due to a one-time easement fee received in 2014 at Wallingford Plaza from the adjacent property owner.\nOur investment income on marketable securities increased to $284,627 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $133,208 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in investment income was due to a larger average invested balance resulting from an increase in holdings over the prior year. We invested an additional $2,000,000 and $2,500,000 into our real estate equity securities portfolio during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The portfolio is regularly adjusted by increasing and decreasing specific holdings primarily based upon changes in sector allocations and, to a lesser degree, based upon performance of specific securities. Proceeds from sale of securities are reinvested in the common stock of other publicly traded REITs, thereby keeping a base of investments that generate dividend income. As of December 31, 2015, our real estate equity securities portfolio had a total investment cost of $7,873,564. All of our investment income on marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of dividend income from these investments.\nExpenses\nOur total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $10,310,944 and $6,131,581, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, general and administrative expenses were $2,012,137 and $2,232,336, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses include a variety of corporate expenses, the largest of which were audit fees, legal fees, directors and officers insurance, and independent director fees. The amount for 2015 was lower than for 2014 primarily due to our advisor's outsourcing of its fund administration services to BNY Mellon that occurred in February 2015. Prior to the switch to BNY Mellon, we were responsible for reimbursing our advisor for costs related to certain of our advisor's employees who were subsequently transitioned to BNY Mellon. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the fees incurred from BNY Mellon were approximately $313,000 less than the employee expense reimbursements to our advisor for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, professional and legal fees were reduced by approximately $148,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of fewer SEC-related consulting fees and more efficient internal processes. The aforementioned savings were offset by slightly higher audit costs due to increased activity and higher directors and officers insurance premiums as we increased our policy limits to be commensurate with our growth upon policy renewal in 2015.\nProperty operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $2,118,849 and $1,007,235, respectively. The increase was due to the acquisitions that occurred during 2014 and 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, depreciation was $2,233,667 and $1,097,034, respectively and amortization was $2,735,138 and $1,461,422, respectively, with the increases due to the additional properties acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nOn a same-store basis (for Wallingford Plaza and Heritage Parkway), property operating expenses, amortization and depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 were consistent with the year ended December 31, 2014, as the amounts for each category were materially unchanged for 2015 compared to 2014.\nThe fixed component of the advisory fee is equal to 1% per annum of the NAV for each share class and is calculated and accrued daily and reflected in our NAV per share. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fixed component of the advisory fee was $607,614 and zero, respectively. The fixed component of the advisory fee was not earned by our advisor until our combined NAV for all share classes reached $50,000,000, which occurred on January 22, 2015.\nIn accordance with our advisory agreement, our advisor can earn the performance component of the advisory fee when the total return to stockholders exceeds a required 6% per annum hurdle. The performance component is calculated separately for each share class and is comprised of the distributions paid to stockholders in each share class combined with the change in price of each share class. The performance component of the advisory fee for each share class is equal to 25% of the excess total return (the portion above the 6% per annum hurdle) allocable to such class; provided that in no event will the performance component exceed 10% of the aggregate total return allocable to such class for such year. The performance component of the advisory fee is payable annually based on the results for the entire calendar year. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the performance component exceeded the 6% per annum hurdle for at least one of the share classes. However, our advisor waived the performance component of the advisory fee for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The actual performance component that our advisor could earn in the future depends on several factors, including but not limited to the performance of our investments, the expenses of the Company and interest rates.\nAcquisition related expenses during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $603,539 and $333,554, respectively. The 2015 amount related primarily to our acquisitions of The Flats at Carrs Hill and Loudoun Gateway, while the 2014 amount related primarily to our acquisitions of Commerce Corner, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza, and Terra\nNova Plaza. Acquisition related expenses during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 also included costs related to pursuit of an acquisition that we ultimately decided not to complete.\nWe expect our acquisition related expenses, depreciation, amortization and property operating expenses to increase in future periods because we anticipate acquiring additional properties in the future.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense was $1,330,601 compared to $1,078,124 for the same period in 2014. This was due to an increase in the weighted average outstanding balance on our line of credit to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our weighted average balance on our line of credit was attributable to our ownership of a greater number of properties as of December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014, all of which were financed on our line of credit. We expect our interest expense to increase in future periods because (1) the interest expense reported during the periods presented reflects a lower average leverage level than we expect to maintain and (2) we anticipate acquiring additional properties in the future with borrowings. However, as we acquire additional properties and finance a portion of those properties with borrowings under our line of credit, we expect our line of credit fees to decrease. In addition, we anticipate utilizing property specific debt as a form of permanent financing along with continuing to use the line of credit to acquire additional properties.\nRealized and Unrealized Losses from Marketable Securities\nSince our initial investment in a portfolio of publicly traded REIT securities, our portfolio has been subject to continual refinements. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, these portfolio refinements resulted in net realized gains of $12,635 and $91,837, respectively. Compared to the 2014 period, the public REIT sector of the equities market continued to improve, however at a slower pace during 2015. During the 2014 calendar year, and into first quarter of 2015, the public REIT sector rose significantly on stable economic growth and interest rates. As a consequence, refinements in our marketable securities portfolio during both periods locked in realized gains that were not fully eliminated during the second quarter of 2015 when the REIT stock sector declined generally, primarily on interest rate fears, the Greek debt situation and a slowing Chinese economy. By the end of 2015, these fears had tempered and the public REIT sector finished the year by recovering the losses of the second quarter and adding further gains. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2015, our securities portfolio experienced a net unrealized gain of $105,958. The net unrealized gain for 2015 was less than the net unrealized gain of $765,053 for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily because the public REIT sector was coming off of a low at December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we owned a portfolio of publicly traded common stock of 44 REITs with a cost basis of $7,873,564 and a fair value of $8,569,004, reflecting a net unrealized gain of $695,440.\nInflation\nThe real estate property sector has not been affected significantly by inflation in the past several years due to the relatively low inflation rate. With the exception of leases with tenants in multifamily properties, we will seek to include provisions in our tenant leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market. Leases in multifamily properties generally turn over on an annual basis and do not typically present the same concerns regarding inflation protection due to their short-term nature.\nNet Asset Value (NAV) per Share\nWe commenced calculating our NAV per share for each class of shares on May 30, 2013, the day we commenced operations. We calculate NAV per share in accordance with the valuation guidelines approved by our board of directors for the purposes of establishing a price for shares sold in our public offering as well as establishing a redemption price.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the major components of our NAV per share as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of NAV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total NAV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Class A Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Class I Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Class T Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in real estate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182,900,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in real estate equity securities (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,609,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,031,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65,200,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.74\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.81\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.74\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,500,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.71\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,258,701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.44\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,582,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The value of our investments in real estate was approximately 6.9% more than their historical cost.\n(2) The value of our investments in real estate securities was approximately 6.2% more than their historical cost.\nAs of December 31, 2016, all properties were appraised by a third-party appraisal firm in addition to our independent valuation advisor. Set forth below are the weighted averages of the key assumptions used in the appraisals of the office properties (Heritage Parkway, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza, Loudoun Gateway and Allied Drive) and the retail properties (Wallingford Plaza and Terra Nova Plaza) as of December 31, 2016. Once we own more than one property for each of the industrial and multifamily property types, we will include the key assumptions for these property types.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Exit Capitalization Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office properties\n</td> <td>7.52%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.77%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail properties\n</td> <td>6.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.00%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese assumptions are determined by our independent valuation advisor or by separate third-party appraisers. A change in these assumptions would impact the calculation of the value of our office property investments. For example, assuming all other factors remain unchanged, an increase in the weighted-average discount rate used as of December 31, 2016 of 0.25% would yield a decrease in the total office property investment value of 2.2% and would yield a decrease in the total retail property investment value of 1.9%.\nThe table below sets forth a reconciliation of our stockholders' equity to our NAV as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total NAV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Class A Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Class I Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Class T Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,271,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unrealized gain on real estate investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,972,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Accumulated depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,349,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Accumulated amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,127,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Deferred costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,306,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Deferred rent receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,445,992\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,582,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe deferred costs and expenses of $11,306,527 are initially excluded from the NAV calculation. This represents amounts payable to our advisor and dealer manager, but is less than the total amount payable to our advisor and dealer manager, as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, because (1) certain amounts payable to our advisor as of December 31, 2016 were recorded as assets and as such have no impact on our NAV as of December 31, 2016, and (2) the amount payable to our advisor and dealer manager as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet includes accrued operating expenses that are reimbursable to our advisor under the advisory agreement and accrued offering costs payable\nto our dealer manager, both of which have been deducted from our NAV as of December 31, 2016 and thus are not deferred. The deferred amounts will be included in the NAV calculation as such costs are reimbursed to our advisor or paid to our dealer manager in accordance with the relevant agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we reimbursed our advisor for $925,687 of deferred offering costs and expenses, which have been included as a deduction to our NAV calculation in a pro rata amount on a daily basis since these reimbursements began in January 2014. The deferred offering costs and expenses above additionally includes $2,352,711 in estimated future trailing fees that will be deducted from the NAV on a daily basis as and when they become payable to the dealer manager. These amounts have not yet been included in the calculation of our NAV because the timing and ultimate amount of the trailing fees to be paid are unknown and dependent on factors including how long the applicable shares remain outstanding. However, under GAAP, we have incurred a liability and have estimated future trailing fees of $2,352,711 as of December 31, 2016 based on shares then outstanding, which is reflected on our most recent consolidated balance sheet.\nLimitations and Risks\nAs with any valuation methodology, our methodology is based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different NAV per share. Accordingly, with respect to our NAV per share, we can provide no assurance that:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a stockholder would be able to realize this NAV per share upon attempting to resell his or her shares;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we would be able to achieve, for our stockholders, the NAV per share, upon a listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange, selling our real estate portfolio, or merging with another company; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the NAV per share, or the methodologies relied upon to estimate the NAV per share, will be found by any regulatory authority to comply with any regulatory requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Furthermore, the NAV per share was calculated as of a particular point in time. The NAV per share will fluctuate over time in response to, among other things, changes in real estate market fundamentals, capital markets activities, and attributes specific to the properties and leases within our portfolio.\nFunds from Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO\u201d)\nWe believe that FFO and MFFO in combination with net loss and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are useful supplemental performance measures that we use to evaluate our operating performance. However, these supplemental, non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or to net cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our performance and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. No single measure can provide users of financial information with sufficient information, and only our disclosures read as a whole can be relied upon to adequately portray our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, other REITs may define FFO and similar measures differently and thus choose to treat certain accounting line items in a manner different from us due to differences in investment and operating strategy or for other reasons.\nFFO\nAs defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure that excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization and the impact of certain non-recurring items such as realized gains and losses on sales of real estate. We believe FFO is a meaningful supplemental financial performance measure of our operating performance that is useful to investors because depreciation and amortization in accordance with GAAP implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Additionally, realized gains and losses on sales of real estate generally occur infrequently. As a result, excluding these items from FFO aids our analysis of our ongoing operations. We use FFO as an indication of our operating performance and as a guide to making decisions about future investments.\nMFFO\nAs defined by the Investment Program Association ( IPA\u201d), MFFO is a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure used to assist us in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that MFFO is helpful as a measure of ongoing operating performance because it excludes costs that management considers more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO. Compared to FFO, MFFO additionally excludes items such as acquisition related costs, straight-line rent and amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles. In addition, there are certain other MFFO adjustments as defined by the IPA that are not applicable to us at this time and\nare not included in our presentation of MFFO. We believe that excluding acquisition costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with our analysis of the operating performance of our portfolio over time, including periods after our acquisition stage.\nWe use FFO and MFFO, among other things: (i) to evaluate and compare the potential performance of the portfolio after the acquisition phase is complete, and (ii) as metrics in evaluating our ongoing distribution policy. We believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analyses and evaluation with these same performance metrics used by us in planning and executing our business strategy. We believe that these performance metrics will assist investors in evaluating the potential performance of the portfolio after the completion of the acquisition phase. However, these supplemental, non-GAAP measures are not necessarily indicative of future performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or to net cash flows from operating activities and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Neither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments used to calculate MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT, or a regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-traded REIT industry at which point we may adjust our calculation and characterization of MFFO.\nThe following unaudited table presents a reconciliation of net loss to FFO and MFFO:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,346,476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,227,696\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,799,104\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate related depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,826,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,233,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,097,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate related amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,803,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,735,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,461,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAREIT defined FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,283,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,741,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>759,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>603,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight line rents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(607,900\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(431,065\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(342,643\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,816,111\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(372,391\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(119,906\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease incentive amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IPA defined MFFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,045,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,541,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>630,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that our FFO for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as compared to our distributions declared for the same period, is not indicative of future performance as we are in the development and acquisition phase of our life cycle. In addition, FFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $1,499,234 of below market intangible lease income for The Sports Authority, Inc. in relation to its lease termination.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments in accordance with our investment strategy and policies, make distributions to our stockholders, redeem shares of our common stock pursuant to our redemption plan, pay our offering and operating fees and expenses and pay interest on any outstanding indebtedness.\nOver time, we generally intend to fund our cash needs for items, other than asset acquisitions, from operations. Our cash needs for acquisitions will be funded primarily from the sale of shares of our common stock in our offerings, and the amount we may raise in such offerings is uncertain. We commenced our follow-on offering on July 12, 2016. We intend to contribute any additional net proceeds from our offerings that are not used or retained to pay the fees and expenses attributable to our operations to our operating partnership. Since our inception through December 31, 2016, we raised $105,507,959 from the sales of shares of our common stock, of which $10,200,000 of our Class I shares were purchased by RREEF America.\nWe may also satisfy our cash needs for acquisitions through the assumption or incurrence of debt. On May 1, 2013, we, as guarantor, and our operating partnership, as borrower, entered into a secured revolving credit facility with Regions\nBank and its affiliates, as administrative agent, sole lead arranger and sole book runner, and other lending institutions that could have become parties to the credit agreement, which we refer to as the Regions line of credit. The Regions line of credit had a capacity of $50,000,000. Borrowings under the Regions line of credit carried a specified interest rate which ranged from 220 to 250 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. The Regions line of credit had a scheduled maturity date of May 1, 2015.\nOn March 6, 2015, we entered into a new secured revolving line of credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, which we refer to as the Wells Fargo line of credit. Upon closing, we borrowed $43,426,851which was used to fully repay and retire the Regions line of credit. The Wells Fargo line of credit has a three-year term with two one-year extension options exercisable by us upon satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of applicable extension fees. The interest rate under the Wells Fargo line of credit is based on the 1-month LIBOR with a spread of 170 to 190 basis points depending on the debt yield as defined in the agreement. The Wells Fargo line of credit had an initial maximum capacity of $75 million, but could be expanded up to a maximum capacity of $150 million upon satisfaction of specified conditions. Each requested expansion must be for at least $25 million and may result in the Wells Fargo line of credit being syndicated. On September 27, 2016, we expanded the maximum capacity of the Wells Fargo line of credit by $25,000,000 to a maximum capacity of $100,000,000. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance and weighted average interest rate under the Wells Fargo line of credit were $65,200,000 and 2.40%, respectively.\nThe Wells Fargo line of credit has as co-borrowers certain wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership, with our Company serving as the guarantor. The borrowing capacity under the Wells Fargo line of credit is based on the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 65% of the aggregate value of the properties in the collateral pool as determined by lender appraisals, (2) an amount that results in a minimum debt yield of 11% based on the in-place net operating income of the collateral pool, or (3) the maximum capacity of the Wells Fargo line of credit. Proceeds from the Wells Fargo line of credit can be used to fund acquisitions, redeem shares pursuant to our redemption plan and for any other corporate purpose. The Wells Fargo line of credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, borrowing conditions and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including that there must be at least five properties in the collateral pool at all times, and the collateral pool must also meet specified concentration provisions, unless waived by the lender. In addition, the guarantor must meet tangible net worth hurdles. On March 22, 2016, we amended the Wells Fargo line of credit agreement, effective December 31, 2015, to revise the tangible net worth definition therein to reflect our property values at the lesser of cost or appraised value as determined by our independent valuation advisor. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nOn March 1, 2016, we, through an an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary as borrower, entered into a credit agreement providing for a $14.5 million secured, fully non-recourse loan with Nationwide Life Insurance Company, or Nationwide. The Nationwide loan is secured by The Flats at Carrs Hill, our 138 unit student housing apartment property in Athens, Georgia. The interest rate for the Nationwide loan is fixed at 3.63% with interest-only payments for the full term of the loan. The maturity date of the Nationwide loan is March 1, 2026 with no extension options. The Nationwide loan permits voluntary prepayment of the full amount of the loan at any time subject to payment of the applicable prepayment premium, which is (a) the greater of a yield maintenance calculation or 1.0% of the principal amount outstanding for prepayments occurring up to and including the 96th month of the term, (b) 2.0% of the principal amount outstanding for prepayments occurring during months 97 through 102 of the term, or (c) 1.0% of the principal amount outstanding for prepayments occurring during months 103 through 114 of the term. The Nationwide loan is prepayable at par during the last six months of the term. Additionally, the Nationwide loan contains a one-time option to be assumed by a new borrower subject to satisfaction, in Nationwide's sole discretion, of specified conditions and payment of a fee equal to 1.0% of the outstanding balance of the loan. Proceeds of $14,500,000 were applied to our Wells Fargo line of credit. Prior to closing of the Nationwide loan, The Flats at Carrs Hill served as additional collateral under the Wells Fargo line of credit.\nOn December 1, 2016, we, through an an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary as borrower, entered into a credit agreement with Hartford Life Insurance Company, or Hartford. Proceeds of $13,000,000 obtained from Hartford were used to repay outstanding balances under the Wells Fargo line of credit, thereby releasing Commerce Corner from the Wells Fargo line of credit. The Hartford loan is a secured, fully non-recourse loan with a term of seven years. The Hartford loan carries a fixed interest rate of 3.41% with interest-only payments for the first 24 months of the term, followed by principal and interest payments for the remainder of the term, based upon a 30-year amortization schedule.\nIn the future, as our assets increase, it may not be commercially feasible, or we may not be able to secure, an adequate line of credit to fund acquisitions, redemptions or other needs. Moreover, actual availability may be reduced at any given time if the values of our real estate or our marketable securities portfolio decline.\nExpense Payments by Our Advisor\nIn connection with our advisory agreement, our advisor agreed to pay all of our organization and offering costs through January 3, 2013, and certain of our organization and offering costs through January 3, 2014, all of which were incurred on our behalf (collectively, the \"Deferred O&O\"). These costs amounted to $4,618,318, and are being reimbursed to our advisor on a pro rata basis over a 60-month period that started January 3, 2014. However, such reimbursements will be limited to a cumulative amount that does not cause our total organization and offering costs with respect to our initial public offering to exceed 15% of the gross proceeds raised from our initial public offering at any time. As of December 31, 2016, the organization and offering costs paid by our advisor did not exceed the 15% limit. Through December 31, 2016, we have reimbursed RREEF America for $2,766,943 for Deferred O&O.\nAlso pursuant to the advisory agreement, our advisor is entitled to reimbursement of certain costs incurred by our advisor or its affiliates that are not incurred under the expense support agreement, as discussed below. Costs eligible for reimbursement, if they are not incurred under the expense support agreement, include most third-party operating expenses, salaries and related costs of its employees who perform services for us (but not those employees for which our advisor earns a separate fee or those employees who are our executive officers) and travel related costs for its employees who incur such costs on our behalf. We will reimburse our advisor for all expenses paid or incurred by our advisor in connection with the services provided to us, subject to the limitations described below regarding the 2%/25% guidelines as defined in our advisory agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our advisor incurred $276,633 of these expenses, of which $72,200 was payable to our advisor as of December 31, 2016.\nOn May 29, 2013, we entered into an expense support agreement with our advisor, which was amended and restated most recently on January 20, 2016, which we refer to as the expense support agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the expense support agreement, our advisor has incurred expenses related to our operations in addition to the Deferred O&O, which we refer to as expense payments. These expense payments included, without limitation, expenses that are organization and offering costs and operating expenses under the advisory agreement. Our advisor agreed to incur these expense payments until the earlier of (i) the date we have surpassed $200,000,000 in aggregate gross proceeds from our offering or (ii) the date the aggregate expense payments by our advisor exceed $9,200,000. As of December 31, 2015, our advisor has incurred $9,200,000 in expense payments. While receiving expense support, we continued to incur and pay certain fees and property level expenses, including acquisition related expenses and interest expense on borrowed funds secured by properties. In addition, commencing with the fourth calendar quarter of 2014, we, as opposed to our advisor, began to incur and pay certain operating expenses, subject to certain limits, which were not treated as expense payments and for which we were not entitled to reimbursement from our advisor.\nAs the expense payment limit had been reached, pursuant to the expense support agreement, in January 2016 the reimbursement provisions were triggered. As such, we commenced making reimbursement payments to our advisor at the rate $250,000 per quarter, subject to adjustment as described in the expense support agreement. During the first quarter of 2016, we reimbursed $250,000 to our advisor under the expense support agreement. On April 25, 2016, we and our advisor entered into a letter agreement that amended certain provisions of the advisory agreement and the expense support agreement, which we refer to as the ESA letter agreement. The ESA letter agreement provides, in part, that our obligations to reimburse our advisor for expense payments under the expense support agreement are suspended until the first calendar month following the month in which we have reached $500 million in offering proceeds from our offerings, which we refer to as the ESA commencement date. We currently owe $8,950,000 to our advisor under the expense support agreement. Beginning the month following the ESA commencement date, we will make monthly reimbursement payments to our advisor in the amount of $416,667 for the first 12 months and $329,166 for the second 12 months, subject to monthly reimbursement payment limitations described in the ESA letter agreement. In addition, pursuant to the ESA letter agreement, if RREEF America is serving as our advisor at the time that we or our Operating Partnership undertakes a liquidation, our remaining obligations to reimburse our advisor for the unpaid Deferred O&O under the advisory agreement and the unpaid monthly reimbursements under the expense support agreement shall be waived.\nLimits on Expense Reimbursement\nIn all cases, reimbursement payments to our advisor will be subject to reduction as necessary in order to ensure that such reimbursement payment will not cause the aggregate organization and offering costs paid by us for a given offering to exceed 15% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares in such offering as of the date of the reimbursement payment, and such reimbursement payment will not adversely affect our ability to maintain our status as a REIT for federal tax purposes.\nIn addition to the reimbursement limitations for organization and offering costs, we are also limited in the amount of\noperating expenses that we may reimburse our advisor. Pursuant to the our charter, we may reimburse our advisor, at the end of each fiscal quarter, for total operating expenses incurred by our advisor; provided, however, that commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2014, which was the fourth full quarter after the quarter in which we made our first investment, we may not reimburse our advisor at the end of any fiscal quarter for total operating expenses (as defined in our charter) that, in the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, exceed the greater of 2% of our average invested assets or 25% of our net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of our assets for that period (which we refer to as the 2%/25% guidelines) for such four-quarter period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may reimburse our advisor for expenses in excess of the 2%/25% guidelines if a majority of our independent directors determine that such excess expenses (which we refer to as an excess amount\u201d) are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. For the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2016, our total operating expenses were $3,260,955, which exceeded the 2%/25% guidelines by $149,133, and our advisor will reimburse us for such excess amount.\nPursuant to the expense support agreement, the amount of the reimbursement payment paid in any calendar quarter will not be aggregated with our cumulative operating expenses for any four consecutive calendar quarters that includes the calendar quarter in which such reimbursement payment is paid, and instead the amount of the unreimbursed expense payments comprising such reimbursement payment will have previously been aggregated with our total operating expenses for the four calendar quarters ending with the calendar quarter in which such expense payment was originally incurred, which we refer to as prior 2%/25% periods.\u201d If an unreimbursed expense payment incurred during a prior 2%/25% period exceeded the 2%/25% guidelines for such prior 2%/25% period, the amount of such excess will only be reimbursed pursuant to the expense support agreement to the extent that our independent directors previously approved such excess with respect to the applicable prior 2%/25% period. Our independent directors have approved the excess amount for every prior 2%/25% period from June 30, 2014 through September 30, 2016.\nWe anticipate our offering and operating fees and expenses will include, among other things, the advisory fee that we pay to our advisor, the selling commissions, dealer manager and distribution fees we pay to the dealer manager, legal and audit expenses, federal and state filing fees, printing expenses, transfer agent fees, marketing and distribution expenses and fees related to appraising and managing our properties. We will not have any office or personnel expenses as we do not have any employees. Our advisor will incur certain of these expenses and fees, for which we will reimburse our advisor, subject to certain limitations. Additionally, our advisor will allocate to us out-of-pocket expenses in connection with providing services to us, including our allocable share of our advisor's overhead, such as rent, utilities and personnel costs for personnel who are directly involved in the performance of services to us and are not our executive officers. Furthermore, our former dealer manager incurred certain bona fide offering expenses in connection with the distribution of our shares for which our former dealer manager was fully repaid in July 2016. Ultimately, total organization and offering costs incurred in a given offering will not exceed 15% of the gross proceeds from such offering. Through December 31, 2016, our advisor has paid on our behalf or reimbursed us for $8,589,137 in organization and offering costs and $5,229,181 in operating expenses. Through December 31, 2016, our dealer manager has incurred on our behalf $150,132 of offering costs. Also, through June 30, 2016, our former deal manager had paid on our behalf $1,618,114 in offering costs. The total organization and offering costs paid by our advisor, the dealer manager and the former dealer manager did not cause us to exceed the 15% limitation as of December 31, 2016 with respect to the initial public offering. If, in future periods, the total organization and offering costs paid by our advisor and the dealer manager cause us to exceed the 15% limitation with respect to the initial public offering, the excess would not be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such period. A similar limitation will apply to the total organization and offering costs incurred with respect to the follow-on public offering. In such event, we may become obligated to reimburse all or a portion of this excess as we raise additional proceeds from our follow-on public offering. The total organization and offering costs paid by our advisor and the dealer manager did not cause us to exceed the 15% limitation as of December 31, 2016 with respect to the follow-on public offering.\nOther potential future sources of capital include secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from the sale of assets. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures.\nCash Flow Analysis\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nCash flow provided by operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $4,935,400 and $2,850,008, respectively. This increase is due to the operating cash flow from the additional properties acquired and a full year of operations for properties acquired in 2015, somewhat offset by higher debt service costs as a result of higher debt balances.\nCash flow used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $33,894,787 and $51,062,345, respectively. During 2016 we acquired one property for $33,761,415, while in 2015 we acquired two properties for $48,954,401. In addition, during 2015 we invested an additional $2,000,000 into our real estate securities portfolio.\nCash flow provided by financing activities was $28,515,773 for the year ended December 31, 2016. We received proceeds of $27,604,469 in our offerings. We paid $5,705,461 in offering costs inclusive of reimbursements to our advisor and our former dealer manager. We borrowed $36,600,000 from our Wells Fargo line of credit to finance the acquisition of Allied Drive and to fund redemptions. We originated two property specific loans totaling $27,500,000 ($14,500,000 from Nationwide on The Flats at Carrs Hill and for $13,000,000 from Hartford on Commerce Center) and used the proceeds along with proceeds of our offerings to repay $43,900,000 outstanding under the Wells Fargo line of credit. In connection with the origination of the two property specific loans and the expansion of our Wells Fargo line of credit to a maximum capacity of $100,000,000, we paid $462,883 in financing costs. Cash distributions to stockholders paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $4,470,040. Of the total distributions declared for the year ended December 31, 2016, $1,882,139 was reinvested via our distribution reinvestment plan. Additionally, we processed redemptions that resulted in payments by us of $10,282,451, after deductions for any applicable 2% short-term trading discounts.\nCash flow provided by financing activities was $48,029,820 for the year ended December 31, 2015. We received proceeds of $32,581,726 in our offering. We paid $684,502 in offering costs that were not covered by our advisor and we reimbursed our advisor for $923,158 of offering costs previously funded by our advisor under our advisory agreement. We had net borrowings of $24,100,000 under our line of credit during 2015. The net borrowings include repayment of the Regions Line of Credit with proceeds from the new Wells Fargo line of credit as well as principal repayments made from offering proceeds. The net borrowings were used for the two property acquisitions during 2015. Cash distributions to stockholders paid during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3,070,769. Of the total distributions declared for the year ended December 31, 2015, $1,342,575 was reinvested via our distribution reinvestment plan.

Deferred financing costs paid by us in connection with refinancing our Regions line of credit and the acquisition of two properties amounted to $922,105.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCash flow provided by operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2,850,008 and $2,917,313, respectively. The 2015 and 2014 periods benefited from the expense support payments from our advisor of $1,097,737 and $2,128,248, respectively. These expense support payments effectively offset most of our general and administrative expenses and most of our deferred financing costs, and includes certain offering costs. In addition, the depreciation and amortization expenses were $4,596,414 and $2,438,550 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The significant increase for the 2015 period relates to a full year of operations on the properties acquired during 2014 and the additional properties acquired during 2015.\nCash flow used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $51,062,345, compared to net usage of $62,340,371 for the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2015 we acquired two properties for $48,954,401, while in 2014 we acquired three properties for $59,719,256. In addition, during 2015 we invested an additional $2,000,000 into our equity securities portfolio of REIT stocks, while we invested $2,500,000 into our equity securities portfolio of REIT stocks during 2014.\nCash flow provided by financing activities was $48,029,820 for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The net borrowings were used for the two property acquisitions during 2015. Cash distributions to stockholders paid during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3,070,769. Of the total distributions declared for the year ended December 31, 2015, $1,342,575 was reinvested via our distribution reinvestment plan. Additionally, we\nprocessed redemptions resulting in payments by us of $4,393,947 after deductions for any applicable 2% short term trading discounts. Deferred financing costs paid by us in connection with refinancing our line of credit and the acquisition of two properties amounted to $922,105.\nCash flow provided by financing activities was $58,626,301 for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Deferred financing costs paid by us in connection with obtaining our Regions line of credit and not reimbursed by our sponsor amounted to $154,871.\nDistributions\nOur board of directors authorized and declared daily cash distributions for each quarter which were payable monthly for the period commencing on January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2016 for each share of Class A, Class I and Class T common stock outstanding. The table below shows the details of the distributions for 2016:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Declared daily distribution rate, before adjustment for class-specific expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.00179534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.00177203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.00181182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.00182234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions paid or payable in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>633,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>631,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>670,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>699,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,635,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions reinvested\n</td> <td>407,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>457,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>513,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,882,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions declared\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,040,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,088,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,174,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,213,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,517,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Source of Distributions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>633,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>631,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>670,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>699,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,635,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinvested via the distribution reinvestment plan\n</td> <td>407,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>457,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>513,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,882,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Sources of Distributions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,040,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,088,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,174,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,213,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,517,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,700,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>644,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,359,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,231,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,935,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds From Operations:\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>956,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,362,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,627,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,338,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,283,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our distributions were covered by our cash flow from operations. For the periods from our inception through December 31, 2015 (but not beyond December 31, 2015), our cash flow from operations included expense support received from our advisor.\nWe expect that we will continue to pay distributions monthly in arrears. Any distributions not reinvested will be payable in cash, and there can be no assurances regarding the portion of the distributions that will be reinvested. We intend to fund distributions from cash generated by operations. However, we may fund distributions from borrowings under our line of credit or from the proceeds of our offering. The payment of distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations or FFO may be dilutive to our NAV because it may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds.\nRedemptions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we processed redemptions for a total of 709,572 Class A shares at a weighted average price of $12.93 per share and redemptions for a total of 84,614 Class I shares at a weighted average price of $13.15 per share, in both cases before allowing for the 2% short-term trading discount. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we processed redemptions for a total of 73,780 Class A shares at a weighted average price of $12.71 per share and redemptions for a total of 274,878 Class I shares at a weighted average price of $12.78 per share, in both cases before allowing for the 2% short-term trading discount. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we processed redemptions for a total of 10,008 Class A shares at a weighted average price of $12.23 per share and redemptions for a total of 60,391 Class I shares at a weighted average price of $12.67 per share, in both cases before allowing for the 2% short-term trading discount. We funded these redemptions with cash flows from operations and with borrowings. As of December 31, 2016, we had no unfulfilled redemption requests.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We consider our critical accounting policies to be the policies that relate to the following concepts.\nReal Estate Investments and Lease Intangibles\nReal estate investments are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Buildings and improvements are depreciated utilizing the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 20 to 40 years for industrial, retail and office properties, and 27.5 years for residential. Tenant improvements, lease commissions and certain lease intangibles are amortized over the terms of the respective tenant leases. Furniture and equipment is depreciated over an estimated useful life ranging from 5 to 7 years.\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations, and FASB ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of operations of acquired properties will be included in our results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. Estimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques believed to be similar to those used by independent appraisers are used to allocate the purchase price of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as land, buildings and improvements, equipment and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities such as amounts related to in-place leases, acquired above- and below-market leases, tenant relationships, asset retirement obligations and mortgage notes payable. Values of buildings and improvements are determined on an as-if-vacant basis. Initial allocations are subject to change until such information is finalized, which may be no later than 12 months from the acquisition date.\nThe estimated fair value of acquired in-place leases are the costs we would have incurred to lease the properties to the occupancy level of the properties at the date of acquisition. Such estimates include the fair value of leasing commissions, legal costs and other direct costs that would be incurred to lease the properties to such occupancy levels. Additionally, we evaluate the time period over which such occupancy levels would be achieved. Such evaluation will include an estimate of the net market-based rental revenues and net operating costs (primarily consisting of forgone rents, real estate taxes, recoverable charges and insurance) that would be incurred during the lease-up period, which generally ranges up to one year. Acquired in-place leases as of the date of acquisition are amortized over the remaining lease terms into amortization expense.\nAcquired above- and below-market lease values are estimated based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the lease acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and our estimate of fair market value lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases. The capitalized above- and below-market lease values are amortized to rental revenue over the remaining terms of the respective leases, which include, for below-market leases, periods covered by bargain fixed-rate renewal options. If a lease is terminated prior to its scheduled expiration, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease is charged to amortization expense and the unamortized portion of the above- or below-market lease is charged to rental revenue.\nThe carrying value of the real estate investments are reviewed to ascertain if there are any indicators of impairment. Factors considered include the type of asset, the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located, the economic situation in the industry in which a tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by a tenant under its lease, as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with a tenant, including property inspection reports. A real estate investment is impaired if the undiscounted cash flows over the expected hold period are less than the real estate investment's carrying amount. In this case, an impairment loss will be recorded to the extent that the estimated fair value of the real estate investment is lower than its carrying amount. The estimated fair value is determined primarily using information contained within independent appraisals obtained quarterly by us from its independent valuation agent. Real estate investments that are expected to be disposed of are valued at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nInvestments in Marketable Securities\nIn accordance with our investment guidelines as approved by our board of directors, investments in marketable securities may consist of common and preferred stock of publicly-traded REITs and other real estate operating companies. We determine the appropriate classification for these securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2016, we classified our investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale as we intend to hold the securities for the purpose of collecting dividend income and for longer term price appreciation. These investments are carried at their estimated fair value based on published prices for each security. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nAny non-temporary decline in the market value of an available-for-sale security below cost results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. When a security is impaired, we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and consider whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment being recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to period end and forecasted performance of the investee.\nSecurities may be sold if we believe a security has attained its target maximum value or if other conditions exist whereby we believe that the value of its investment in a particular security has a larger than desired risk of declining. We consider many factors in determining whether to hold or sell a security, including, but not limited to, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, external credit ratings and recent changes in such ratings. Upon the sale of a particular security, the realized net gain or loss is computed assuming the shares with the highest cost are sold first.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental revenue from real estate investments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. The differences between rental revenue earned from real estate investments and amounts due under the respective lease agreements are amortized or accreted, as applicable, to deferred rent receivable. Rental revenue will also include amortization of above- and below-market leases, as well as amortization of lease incentives. Revenues relating to lease termination fees will be recognized at the time that a tenant's right to occupy the leased space is terminated and collectability is reasonably assured. Also included in rental revenue are tenant reimbursements of certain operating expenses and percentage rents determined in accordance with the terms of the lease agreements.\nOrganization and Offering Expenses\nOrganizational expenses and other expenses which do not qualify as offering costs are expensed as incurred from and after the commencement of operations. Offering costs are those costs incurred by us, RREEF America and its affiliates on our behalf which relate directly to our activities of raising capital in the offering, preparing for the offering, the qualification and registration of the Offering, and the marketing and distribution of our shares. This includes, but is not limited to, accounting and legal fees, including the legal fees of the Dealer Manager, costs for registration statement amendments and prospectus supplements, printing, mailing and distribution costs, filing fees, amounts to reimburse RREEF America as our advisor or its affiliates for the salaries of employees and other costs in connection with preparing supplemental sales literature, amounts to reimburse the Dealer Manager for amounts that it may pay to reimburse the bona fide due diligence expenses of any participating broker-dealers supported by detailed and itemized invoices, telecommunication costs, fees of the transfer agent, registrars, trustees, depositories and experts, the cost of educational conferences held by us (including the travel, meal and lodging costs of registered representatives of any participating broker-dealers), and attendance fees and cost reimbursement for employees of affiliates to attend retail seminars conducted by broker-dealers. Offering costs will be deferred and will be paid from the proceeds of the offerings. These\ncosts will be treated as a reduction of the total proceeds. Total organization and offering costs incurred by us with respect to a particular offering will not exceed 15% of the gross proceeds from such offering. In addition, we will not reimburse RREEF America or the Dealer Manager for any underwriting compensation (a subset of organization and offering costs) which would cause our total underwriting compensation to exceed 10% of the gross proceeds from the primary portion of an offering.\nIncluded in offering costs are certain distribution fees and dealer manager fees paid on a trailing basis, computed daily as a percentage of the NAV of specified classes of our common stock, which we refer to as trailing fees. At each reporting date,we accrue an estimate for the amount of trailing fees that ultimately may be paid on the outstanding shares. Such estimate reflects our assumptions for certain variables, including future redemptions with respect to each offering, share price appreciation and the total gross proceeds to be raised during the currently effective offering. In addition, the estimated accrual for future trailing fees as of a given reporting date may be reduced by the aforementioned limits on total organization and offering costs and total underwriting compensation. Changes in this estimate will be recorded prospectively as an adjustment to additional paid in capital.\nCertain Accounting Pronouncements Effective in the Future\nIn January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-01, Financial Statements - Overall (Subtopic 825-10) - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 amends the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although ASU 2016-01 retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to investments in equity securities, excluding those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee. Under ASU 2016-01, investments in equity securities that fall within the scope of ASU 2016-01 will be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. ASU 2016-01 also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for us on January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted for certain provisions. Upon adoption, we will be required to record the amount of net unrealized gain or loss on our investments in marketable securities in earnings via a cumulative effect adjustment. We presently do not intend to early adopt ASU 2016-01.\nIn August 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows, (Topic 230): Classification of Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which identifies the principles for the classification of eight specific types of cash flow with the objective of providing specific guidance on these specified cash flows. The cash flows that may be pertinent to us in the future include debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration of payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims and distributions received. In addition, ASU 2016-01 also specifies the classification of cash flows for payments made under zero-coupon debt instruments, such as our note to affiliate on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we made one payment of $250,000 to our advisor under the note to affiliate. Under ASU 2016-15, the portion of such payment representing the imputed interest expense would be reflected in cash flows from operating activities. Under current GAAP, the entire cash flow is reported as a financing activity. ASU 2016-15 will become effective for us on January 1, 2018. Upon adoption, ASU 2016-15 must be applied retrospectively, implying that prior periods presented should be adjusted to conform to ASU 2016-15, unless to do so would be impracticable. We are currently evaluating the full impact of ASU 2016-15 our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, the intent of which is to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (and dispositions) of assets or businesses. Under the current implementation guidance, real estate has broadly been interpreted to be a business, which requires, among other things, that acquisition related costs be expensed at the time of acquisition. The amendments in ASU 2017-01 provide a screen to determine when a set of identifiable assets is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. Generally, a real estate asset and its related leases will be considered a single identifiable asset and therefore will not meet the definition of a business. If the real estate and related leases in an acquisition are determined to be an asset and not a business, then the acquisition related costs would be capitalized onto the balance sheet. ASU 2017-01 is effective for us on January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted in certain circumstances. Adoption of ASU 2017-01 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, but may affect transactions in real estate that occur after adoption. We presently intend to early adopt ASU 2017-01, but will more fully evaluate this option based on the specifics of our next real estate transaction.\nIn May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers. ASU 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in their financial statements in a manner that depicts the transfer of the promised goods or services to\nits customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity is entitled at the time of transfer of those goods or services. As a result, the amount and timing of revenue recognition may be affected. However, certain types of contracts are excluded from the provisions of ASU 2014-09, including leases. However, other types of real estate related contracts, such as for dispositions or development of real estate, will be impacted by ASU 2014-09. In addition, ASU 2014-09 requires additional disclosures regarding revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09, as amended, becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Upon adoption, ASU 2014-09 must be applied retrospectively either (a) to each prior reporting period presented, or (b) with a cumulative effect adjustment. We do not intend to early adopt ASU 2014-09, and we are evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. Presently, we intend to adopt via a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of adoption.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. ASU 2016-02 requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. As of December 31, 2016, we are not a lessee under any lease contracts. Upon adoption, we would apply a modified retrospective approach that will depend on the types of leases we have in force at the time of adoption. ASU 2016-02 is effective for us on January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.\nREIT Compliance and Income Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code for the year ended December 31, 2013. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to, among other things, distribute as dividends at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent our income meets certain criteria and we distribute our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Even as a REIT, we may be subject to (1) certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth, and (2) federal income and excise taxes on undistributed income, if any income remains undistributed. Many of these requirements are highly technical and complex. We will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. If we were to fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we could be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions paid to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT. We would also be disqualified for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016. Also see Notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the other unaudited financial data included in this Annual Report. We further invite you to visit our website, www.rreefpropertytrust.com, where we routinely post additional information about our company, such as, without limitation, our daily net asset value, or NAV, per share, press releases and information about upcoming investor conference calls. The public may find this information on our website. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference. The terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d and the Company\u201d refer to RREEF Property Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nThe Company's NAV per share is published daily via NASDAQ's Mutual Fund Quotation System under the symbols ZRPTAX, ZRPTIX and ZRPTTX for its Class A shares, Class I shares and Class T shares, respectively.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation formed on February 7, 2012, to invest in a diversified portfolio of high quality, income-producing commercial real estate properties and other real estate-related assets. We are an externally advised, perpetual-life corporation that qualified as a REIT for the calendar year ended December 31, 2013 for federal income tax purposes. We hold our properties, real estate-related assets and other investments through RREEF Property Operating Partnership, LP, or our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner.\nWe invest primarily in the office, industrial, retail and multifamily sectors of the commercial real estate industry in the United States. We may also invest in real estate-related assets, which include common and preferred stock of publicly traded REITs and other real estate companies, which we refer to as real estate equity securities,\u201d and debt investments backed by real estate, which we refer to as real estate loans.\u201d\nOur board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, our board has delegated to our advisor authority to manage our day-to-day business in accordance with our investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations.\nOn May 30, 2013, upon receipt of a purchase order from our sponsor for $10,000,000 of Class I shares of our common stock and the release to us of funds in the escrow account, we commenced operations. Prior to May 30, 2013, we had neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues. Our entire activity from our inception date through May 30, 2013 was to prepare for and implement our public offering of our common stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we accomplished the following:\n \u2022 Acquired one medical office property outside of Boston, Massachusetts, for $34,000,000, increasing both our geographic and property type diversification; \n \u2022 Expanded our Wells Fargo line of credit to a maximum capacity of $100,000,000; \n \u2022 Maintained 100% occupancy in the real estate portfolio; \n \u2022 Secured two fully non-recourse, fixed-rate loans totaling $27.5 million on two separate properties; \n \u2022 Successfully launched our follow-on public offering; and \n \u2022 Raised approximately $27.6 million of new capital from investors. \nFurther detail on these activities is provided below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nPortfolio Information\nReal Estate Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2016, our real estate portfolio was comprised of eight properties diversified across geography and sector. Details of the properties acquired in the past three years are shown below.\n2014 Acquisitions\nOn April 11, 2014, we acquired a fee simple interest in an industrial building and an adjacent lot located in Logan Township, New Jersey ( Commerce Corner\u201d) for a purchase price of $19,750,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded\nthis acquisition with existing capital and $17,600,000 from our line of credit. Of the $17,600,000 borrowed, $8,760,000 was from existing borrowing capacity on previously acquired properties, while $8,840,000 was allocated to Commerce Corner. Commerce Corner is a 259,910 square-foot industrial building located on a 14.4 acre site at 1109 Commerce Boulevard, plus an additional adjacent 9.7 acre parcel of land which is partially utilized by one of the tenants for additional trailer parking.

Among other amenities, The Flats at Carrs Hill features a full-size indoor basketball court, multiple lounges, a 24-hour fitness center and a pool. Additionally, UGA recently approved an expansion of the North Oconee River Greenway trail, a 3.65 mile walking and biking path, which will provide the student residents direct pedestrian access to additional parts of campus.\nOn December 21, 2015, we acquired a fee simple interest in an office building located in Sterling, Virginia (\"Loudoun Gateway\") for a purchase price of $21,950,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded the acquisition with existing capital and by borrowing $20,000,000 from our line of credit.

The greater Washington, DC metropolitan area can be accessed via four routes: Route 28, the Dulles Toll Road, Route 50, and Route 7. Dining, entertainment and shopping facilities in Dulles Town Center, Dulles Town Crossing, Dulles 28 Centre, and Reston Town Center are all within short driving distances of Loudoun Gateway.\n2016 Acquisition\nOn September 27, 2016, we acquired a fee simple interest in a medical office building located in Dedham, Massachusetts (\"Allied Drive\") for a purchase price of $34,000,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded the acquisition with cash on hand and a $32,400,000 borrowing from our Wells Fargo line of credit. Of the $32,400,000 borrowed, approximately $13,100,000 is from existing borrowing capacity on previously acquired properties, while approximately\n$19,300,000 is allocated to Allied Drive. Allied Drive is a two-story, 64,127 rentable square foot Class A medical office building approximately 20 miles outside of Boston. The property is located at Allied Drive in Dedham, Massachusetts directly off of Route 128 / Interstate 95, providing easy vehicular access to a network of highways and other commuter thoroughfares that connect to the broader Boston metropolitan region. Allied Drive is also accessible via the commuter rail MBTA stop, which services Boston in less than 10 minutes. Legacy Place, University Station, Dedham Mall and Hilton Boston - Dedham are within short driving distances of Allied Drive, offering tenants a multitude of dining, entertainment and lodging options. Newly constructed in 2013, Allied Drive was built with a full spectrum of orthopedic-related services, featuring eight state-of-the-art operating rooms, a hospital-quality post-anesthesia care unit, diagnostic imaging and ancillary service space and Class A medical office suites.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our weighted average remaining lease term was 7.1 years. The following table presents certain additional information about the properties we owned as of December 31, 2016:\n\n(1) Occupancy is based on executed leases as of December 31, 2016.\n(2) Wallingford Plaza is ground floor retail plus two floors of office space. The retail portion comprises the majority of the rental revenue for the property.\nReal Estate Equity Securities Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2016, our real estate equity securities portfolio consisted of publicly traded common stock of 40 REITs with a value of $8,609,212. We believe that investing a portion of our proceeds from our offering into a diversified portfolio of common and preferred shares of REITs and other real estate operating companies will provide our overall portfolio flexibility with near-term liquidity as well as potentially enhance our NAV over a longer period. The real estate equity securities portfolio is regularly reviewed and evaluated to determine whether the marketable securities held at any time continue to serve their original intended purposes.\nThe following chart summarizes our marketable securities by property type as of December 31, 2016:\nAs of December 31, 2016, our top ten holdings in our real estate equity securities portfolio were as follows:\n\nMarket Outlook\nCommercial real estate had a strong year during 2016. For the most part, demand continued to outstrip supply, pushing vacancy rates lower and rents higher. Commercial real estate prices generally ended the year above where they started, delivering total returns to core real estate in line with the historical average for commercial real estate. In more subtle ways, however, we believe the landscape began to shift. While fundamentals were strong, financial-market volatility curbed the decline of capitalization rates that had powered capital gains since 2010. Total annual returns on an unleveraged basis slipped into the single digits for the first time since the recent financial crisis.\nWe believe that commercial real estate will deliver a similar return profile over the next five years. Given that supply is generally moderate and shows tentative signs of peaking, we believe that real estate is positioned to generate healthy net operating income growth. At the same time, rising interest rates and temperate capital flows directly into commercial real estate are expected to put modest upward pressure on capitalization rates, slowing the pace of appreciation. We expect\ntotal annual unleveraged returns on commercial real estate will be primarily income driven, averaging 5%-6% annually through 2021 (6%-7% over the next two years).\nWhile a more normalized return profile may be disappointing to some investors, in our view it represents a soft landing that should be welcomed. We believe the U.S. economy does not suffer from overt excesses, such as inflation or asset bubbles, that have precipitated past recessions. We believe supply is generally under control, real estate is not over-leveraged and valuations are not stretched on a relative basis. In this context, a moderation of returns should help extend the duration of the cycle, or in a worst case scenario, cushion the severity of any downturn, which we continue to believe is several years off.\nResults of Operations\nWe commenced operations on May 30, 2013 upon receipt of $10,000,000 in proceeds from our sponsor in our initial public offering. On May 31, 2013, we acquired our first property and made our initial investments in marketable securities. Since then and through December 31, 2016, we acquired seven additional properties and significantly increased our outstanding debt balance as described above under \"Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio.\" In addition, we expect to continue to raise additional capital, increase our borrowings and make future acquisitions, which we believe will have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenues\nOur rental income increased to $15,102,464 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $8,050,514 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our tenant reimbursement income increased to $1,514,772 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $1,066,073 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our 2016 rental and tenant reimbursement income increased from 2015 due to the property acquisitions occurring during 2015 and 2016 as described above under \"Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio.\" Also included in our 2016 rental and tenant reimbursement income is approximately $1,499,234 related to the fully amortized below market lease liability at Terra Nova Plaza for The Sports Authority, Inc. In connection with the bankruptcy proceedings of The Sports Authority, Inc., on June 29, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. won the right at auction to assume and/or negotiate a new lease for the space at Terra Nova Plaza occupied by The Sports Authority, Inc. In September 2016, we executed a 10-year lease with Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., which was subsequently approved by the bankruptcy court on September 26, 2016 at which time Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. became the tenant, effectively terminating the lease with The Sports Authority, Inc. At such time, all remaining lease intangibles related to The Sports Authority, Inc. were fully amortized through the lease termination date.\nStraight line revenues increased to $836,108 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $431,065 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in straight line revenues for 2016 over 2015 was due to our additional property acquisitions. Typically, our leases have contractual base rent increases, which cause corresponding decreases in the straight line rent adjustments once effective. In addition, we recognized approximately $264,000 of straight line revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the lease with Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., a result of the lease beginning in September 2016 but cash base rent not commencing until March 1, 2017.\nHeritage Parkway, Wallingford Plaza, Commerce Corner, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza and Terra Nova Plaza represent our same-store real estate investments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, being the properties owned for the entirety of both periods. For those properties, property income was up $1,622,000 in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to $1,499,234 from the full amortization of the below market lease liability related to the termination of the lease with The Sports Authority, Inc. as described above. Base rental income had a minimal change over the prior period as contractual base rent increases at the properties were offset by three months of free rent at Terra Nova Plaza related to the lease with Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. Straight line revenue increased by approximately $125,000, primarily a result of the $264,000 recognized from the Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. lease offsetting decreases from the other properties. In addition, the 2016 period saw increased tenant reimbursements of approximately $57,000 primarily related similar increases in recoverable operating expenses.\nOur investment income on marketable securities increased to $484,912 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $284,627 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in investment income was due to certain securities providing greater distributions in 2016 as a result of asset sales. Such greater distributions may not continue in future periods. The portfolio is regularly adjusted by increasing and decreasing specific holdings primarily based upon\nchanges in sector allocations and to a lesser degree based upon performance of specific securities. Proceeds from sale of securities are primarily reinvested in the common stock of other publicly traded REITs, thereby keeping a base of investments that generate dividend income. As of December 31, 2016, our real estate equity securities portfolio had a total investment cost of $8,103,761. All of our investment income on marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was comprised of dividend income from these investments.\nExpenses\nOur total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $19,214,799 and $10,310,944, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses were $2,091,416 and $2,012,137, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses include a variety of corporate expenses, the largest of which were audit fees, legal fees, professional fees, directors and officers insurance and independent director compensation. The amount for the 2016 period is higher than 2015 primarily due to higher audit fees and other professional fees related to tax and compliance.\nProperty operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $5,158,942 and $2,118,849, respectively. The increase in property operating expenses from 2015 to 2016 is primarily due to the 2015 property acquisitions occurring late in the year as described above under \"Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio.\" In addition, we recognized approximately $545,000 of bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the bankruptcy filing of The Sports Authority, Inc. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, depreciation was $3,826,198 and $2,233,667, respectively and amortization was $6,803,850 and $2,735,138, respectively. Depreciation and amortization also increased in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period as a result of the additional acquisitions. Furthermore, the 2016 period includes $1,898,000 in amortization expense due to the full amortization of the acquired intangible lease assets related to The Sports Authority, Inc. lease.\nOn a same-store basis (for Heritage Parkway, Wallingford Plaza, Commerce Corner, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza and Terra Nova Plaza), property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by approximately $628,000 compared to the same period of 2015 primarily due to $545,000 of bad debt expense and, to a lesser degree, legal costs, at Terra Nova Plaza related to the bankruptcy of The Sports Authority, Inc. In addition, we recognized increased real estate taxes of approximately $40,000, primarily related to Commerce Corner. On a same-store basis, amortization increased approximately $1,854,000, primarily due to the additional amortization related to The Sports Authority Inc. lease as noted above, however, depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe fixed component of the advisory fee is equal to 1% per annum of the NAV for each share class and is calculated and accrued daily and reflected in our NAV per share. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fixed component of the advisory fee was $900,726 and $607,614, respectively. The fixed component of the advisory fee was not earned by our advisor until our combined NAV for all share classes reached $50,000,000, which occurred on January 22, 2015. The increase in the fixed component of the advisory fee is due to the additional capital raised during 2016 as well as an increase to our NAV resulting from appreciation of our real estate investments.\nIn accordance with our advisory agreement, our advisor can earn the performance component of the advisory fee when the total return to stockholders exceeds a required 6% per annum hurdle. The performance component is calculated separately for each share class and is comprised of the distributions paid to stockholders in each share class combined with the change in price of each share class. The performance component of the advisory fee for each share class is equal to 25% of the excess total return (the portion above the 6% per annum hurdle) allocable to such class; provided that in no event will the performance component exceed 10% of the aggregate total return allocable to such class for such year. The performance component of the advisory fee is payable annually based on the results for the entire calendar year. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the performance component exceeded the 6% per annum hurdle for at least one of the share classes. However, our advisor waived the performance component of the advisory fee for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the performance component of the advisory fee was $274,905. The actual performance component that our advisor could earn in the future depends on several factors, including but not limited to the performance of our investments, our expenses and interest rates.\nAcquisition related expenses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $158,762 and $603,539, respectively. The 2016 amount related to our acquisition of Allied Drive and the 2015 amount related primarily to our acquisitions of The Flats at Carrs Hill and Loudoun Gateway. Acquisition related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 also included costs related to pursuit of acquisitions that we ultimately decided not to complete.\nWe expect our acquisition related expenses, depreciation, amortization and property operating expenses to increase in future periods because we anticipate acquiring additional properties in the future.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense was $2,427,110 compared to $1,330,601 for the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to a greater weighted average outstanding aggregate loan balance due to additional borrowings on our line of credit related to acquisitions which occurred in the second half of 2015 and late 2016. The weighted average outstanding balance on our line of credit was $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our weighted average balance on our line of credit was attributable to our ownership of a greater number of properties during 2016 as compared to 2015. Additionally contributing to the increased interest expense in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period is the long term property specific loans that were originated in 2016. On March 1, 2016, we originated a $14,500,000 loan for The Flats at Carrs Hill which has a fixed interest rate of 3.63%. In addition, on December 1, 2016, we originated a $13,000,000 loan for Commerce Corner which has a fixed interest rate of 3.41%. Interest expense is greater from these loans as the interest rates are slightly higher than the 2.1% - 2.4% interest rate on the Wells Fargo line of credit, and there is additional amortization of financing costs associated with these fixed rate loans. Lastly, the increase in overall interest expense from 2015 to 2016 was partly due to the imputation of interest of $209,772 on our note to affiliate. Because we reached our maximum expense support of $9,200,000 from our advisor as of December 31, 2015, the repayment provisions of the expense support agreement were triggered in January 2016, causing us to impute interest on the payment stream. We expect our interest expense to increase in future periods because we anticipate acquiring additional properties with borrowings in the future. However, as we acquire additional properties and finance a portion of those properties with borrowings under our line of credit, we expect our line of credit fees to decrease. In addition, we anticipate utilizing additional property specific debt as a form of permanent financing along with continuing to use the line of credit to acquire additional properties.\nRealized and Unrealized Losses from Marketable Securities\nOur portfolio of investments in publicly-traded REIT securities is subject to continual adjustments in positions held as the portfolio is actively managed among different sectors. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, these portfolio refinements resulted in net realized gains of $193,285 and $12,635, respectively. During 2016, the REIT securities market generally gained ground during the first half, followed by a somewhat negative second half of the year due to expectations of a rise in interest rates as well as the uncertainty of the presidential election. During 2015, the REIT stock sector declined generally, primarily as a result of interest rate fears, the Greek debt situation and a slowing Chinese economy, although by the end of 2015, these fears had tempered and the public REIT sector finished the year by recovering the losses and adding further gains resulting in unrealized gains. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2016, our securities portfolio experienced a net unrealized loss of $189,989, while the year ended December 31, 2015 experienced a net unrealized gain of $105,958. As of December 31, 2016, we owned a portfolio of publicly traded common stock of 40 REITs with a cost basis of $8,103,761 and a fair value of $8,609,212, reflecting a net unrealized gain of $505,451.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nOur rental income increased to $8,050,514 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4,591,711 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our tenant reimbursement income increased to $1,066,073 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $593,845 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our 2015 rental and tenant reimbursement income increased from 2014 due to the property acquisitions occurring during 2014 and 2015 as described above under \"Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio.\" Straight line revenues increased to $431,065 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $342,643 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in straight line revenues for 2015 over 2014 is reflective of our additional property acquisitions.\nWallingford Plaza and Heritage Parkway represent our only same-store real estate investments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, being the only properties owned for the entirety of the periods. For those properties, other property income was down $40,000 in 2015 compared to 2014, due to a one-time easement fee received in 2014 at Wallingford Plaza from the adjacent property owner.\nOur investment income on marketable securities increased to $284,627 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $133,208 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in investment income was due to a larger average invested balance resulting from an increase in holdings over the prior year. We invested an additional $2,000,000 and $2,500,000 into our real estate equity securities portfolio during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The portfolio is regularly adjusted by increasing and decreasing specific holdings primarily based upon changes in sector allocations and, to a lesser degree, based upon performance of specific securities. Proceeds from sale of securities are reinvested in the common stock of other publicly traded REITs, thereby keeping a base of investments that generate dividend income. As of December 31, 2015, our real estate equity securities portfolio had a total investment cost of $7,873,564. All of our investment income on marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of dividend income from these investments.\nExpenses\nOur total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $10,310,944 and $6,131,581, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, general and administrative expenses were $2,012,137 and $2,232,336, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses include a variety of corporate expenses, the largest of which were audit fees, legal fees, directors and officers insurance, and independent director fees. The amount for 2015 was lower than for 2014 primarily due to our advisor's outsourcing of its fund administration services to BNY Mellon that occurred in February 2015. Prior to the switch to BNY Mellon, we were responsible for reimbursing our advisor for costs related to certain of our advisor's employees who were subsequently transitioned to BNY Mellon. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the fees incurred from BNY Mellon were approximately $313,000 less than the employee expense reimbursements to our advisor for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, professional and legal fees were reduced by approximately $148,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of fewer SEC-related consulting fees and more efficient internal processes. The aforementioned savings were offset by slightly higher audit costs due to increased activity and higher directors and officers insurance premiums as we increased our policy limits to be commensurate with our growth upon policy renewal in 2015.\nProperty operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $2,118,849 and $1,007,235, respectively. The increase was due to the acquisitions that occurred during 2014 and 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, depreciation was $2,233,667 and $1,097,034, respectively and amortization was $2,735,138 and $1,461,422, respectively, with the increases due to the additional properties acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nOn a same-store basis (for Wallingford Plaza and Heritage Parkway), property operating expenses, amortization and depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 were consistent with the year ended December 31, 2014, as the amounts for each category were materially unchanged for 2015 compared to 2014.\nThe fixed component of the advisory fee is equal to 1% per annum of the NAV for each share class and is calculated and accrued daily and reflected in our NAV per share. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fixed component of the advisory fee was $607,614 and zero, respectively. The fixed component of the advisory fee was not earned by our advisor until our combined NAV for all share classes reached $50,000,000, which occurred on January 22, 2015.\nIn accordance with our advisory agreement, our advisor can earn the performance component of the advisory fee when the total return to stockholders exceeds a required 6% per annum hurdle. The performance component is calculated separately for each share class and is comprised of the distributions paid to stockholders in each share class combined with the change in price of each share class. The performance component of the advisory fee for each share class is equal to 25% of the excess total return (the portion above the 6% per annum hurdle) allocable to such class; provided that in no event will the performance component exceed 10% of the aggregate total return allocable to such class for such year. The performance component of the advisory fee is payable annually based on the results for the entire calendar year. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the performance component exceeded the 6% per annum hurdle for at least one of the share classes. However, our advisor waived the performance component of the advisory fee for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The actual performance component that our advisor could earn in the future depends on several factors, including but not limited to the performance of our investments, the expenses of the Company and interest rates.\nAcquisition related expenses during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $603,539 and $333,554, respectively. The 2015 amount related primarily to our acquisitions of The Flats at Carrs Hill and Loudoun Gateway, while the 2014 amount related primarily to our acquisitions of Commerce Corner, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza, and Terra\nNova Plaza. Acquisition related expenses during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 also included costs related to pursuit of an acquisition that we ultimately decided not to complete.\nWe expect our acquisition related expenses, depreciation, amortization and property operating expenses to increase in future periods because we anticipate acquiring additional properties in the future.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense was $1,330,601 compared to $1,078,124 for the same period in 2014. This was due to an increase in the weighted average outstanding balance on our line of credit to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our weighted average balance on our line of credit was attributable to our ownership of a greater number of properties as of December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014, all of which were financed on our line of credit. We expect our interest expense to increase in future periods because (1) the interest expense reported during the periods presented reflects a lower average leverage level than we expect to maintain and (2) we anticipate acquiring additional properties in the future with borrowings. However, as we acquire additional properties and finance a portion of those properties with borrowings under our line of credit, we expect our line of credit fees to decrease. In addition, we anticipate utilizing property specific debt as a form of permanent financing along with continuing to use the line of credit to acquire additional properties.\nRealized and Unrealized Losses from Marketable Securities\nSince our initial investment in a portfolio of publicly traded REIT securities, our portfolio has been subject to continual refinements. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, these portfolio refinements resulted in net realized gains of $12,635 and $91,837, respectively. Compared to the 2014 period, the public REIT sector of the equities market continued to improve, however at a slower pace during 2015. During the 2014 calendar year, and into first quarter of 2015, the public REIT sector rose significantly on stable economic growth and interest rates. As a consequence, refinements in our marketable securities portfolio during both periods locked in realized gains that were not fully eliminated during the second quarter of 2015 when the REIT stock sector declined generally, primarily on interest rate fears, the Greek debt situation and a slowing Chinese economy. By the end of 2015, these fears had tempered and the public REIT sector finished the year by recovering the losses of the second quarter and adding further gains. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2015, our securities portfolio experienced a net unrealized gain of $105,958. The net unrealized gain for 2015 was less than the net unrealized gain of $765,053 for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily because the public REIT sector was coming off of a low at December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we owned a portfolio of publicly traded common stock of 44 REITs with a cost basis of $7,873,564 and a fair value of $8,569,004, reflecting a net unrealized gain of $695,440.\nInflation\nThe real estate property sector has not been affected significantly by inflation in the past several years due to the relatively low inflation rate. With the exception of leases with tenants in multifamily properties, we will seek to include provisions in our tenant leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market. Leases in multifamily properties generally turn over on an annual basis and do not typically present the same concerns regarding inflation protection due to their short-term nature.\nNet Asset Value (NAV) per Share\nWe commenced calculating our NAV per share for each class of shares on May 30, 2013, the day we commenced operations. We calculate NAV per share in accordance with the valuation guidelines approved by our board of directors for the purposes of establishing a price for shares sold in our public offering as well as establishing a redemption price.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the major components of our NAV per share as of December 31, 2016:\n\n(1) The value of our investments in real estate was approximately 6.9% more than their historical cost.\n(2) The value of our investments in real estate securities was approximately 6.2% more than their historical cost.\nAs of December 31, 2016, all properties were appraised by a third-party appraisal firm in addition to our independent valuation advisor. Set forth below are the weighted averages of the key assumptions used in the appraisals of the office properties (Heritage Parkway, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza, Loudoun Gateway and Allied Drive) and the retail properties (Wallingford Plaza and Terra Nova Plaza) as of December 31, 2016. Once we own more than one property for each of the industrial and multifamily property types, we will include the key assumptions for these property types.\n\nThese assumptions are determined by our independent valuation advisor or by separate third-party appraisers. A change in these assumptions would impact the calculation of the value of our office property investments. For example, assuming all other factors remain unchanged, an increase in the weighted-average discount rate used as of December 31, 2016 of 0.25% would yield a decrease in the total office property investment value of 2.2% and would yield a decrease in the total retail property investment value of 1.9%.\nThe table below sets forth a reconciliation of our stockholders' equity to our NAV as of December 31, 2016.\n\nThe deferred costs and expenses of $11,306,527 are initially excluded from the NAV calculation. This represents amounts payable to our advisor and dealer manager, but is less than the total amount payable to our advisor and dealer manager, as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, because (1) certain amounts payable to our advisor as of December 31, 2016 were recorded as assets and as such have no impact on our NAV as of December 31, 2016, and (2) the amount payable to our advisor and dealer manager as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet includes accrued operating expenses that are reimbursable to our advisor under the advisory agreement and accrued offering costs payable\nto our dealer manager, both of which have been deducted from our NAV as of December 31, 2016 and thus are not deferred. The deferred amounts will be included in the NAV calculation as such costs are reimbursed to our advisor or paid to our dealer manager in accordance with the relevant agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we reimbursed our advisor for $925,687 of deferred offering costs and expenses, which have been included as a deduction to our NAV calculation in a pro rata amount on a daily basis since these reimbursements began in January 2014. The deferred offering costs and expenses above additionally includes $2,352,711 in estimated future trailing fees that will be deducted from the NAV on a daily basis as and when they become payable to the dealer manager. These amounts have not yet been included in the calculation of our NAV because the timing and ultimate amount of the trailing fees to be paid are unknown and dependent on factors including how long the applicable shares remain outstanding. However, under GAAP, we have incurred a liability and have estimated future trailing fees of $2,352,711 as of December 31, 2016 based on shares then outstanding, which is reflected on our most recent consolidated balance sheet.\nLimitations and Risks\nAs with any valuation methodology, our methodology is based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different NAV per share. Accordingly, with respect to our NAV per share, we can provide no assurance that:\n \u2022 a stockholder would be able to realize this NAV per share upon attempting to resell his or her shares; \n \u2022 we would be able to achieve, for our stockholders, the NAV per share, upon a listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange, selling our real estate portfolio, or merging with another company; or \n \u2022 the NAV per share, or the methodologies relied upon to estimate the NAV per share, will be found by any regulatory authority to comply with any regulatory requirements.  Furthermore, the NAV per share was calculated as of a particular point in time. The NAV per share will fluctuate over time in response to, among other things, changes in real estate market fundamentals, capital markets activities, and attributes specific to the properties and leases within our portfolio.\nFunds from Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO\u201d)\nWe believe that FFO and MFFO in combination with net loss and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are useful supplemental performance measures that we use to evaluate our operating performance. However, these supplemental, non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or to net cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our performance and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. No single measure can provide users of financial information with sufficient information, and only our disclosures read as a whole can be relied upon to adequately portray our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, other REITs may define FFO and similar measures differently and thus choose to treat certain accounting line items in a manner different from us due to differences in investment and operating strategy or for other reasons.\nFFO\nAs defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure that excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization and the impact of certain non-recurring items such as realized gains and losses on sales of real estate. We believe FFO is a meaningful supplemental financial performance measure of our operating performance that is useful to investors because depreciation and amortization in accordance with GAAP implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Additionally, realized gains and losses on sales of real estate generally occur infrequently. As a result, excluding these items from FFO aids our analysis of our ongoing operations. We use FFO as an indication of our operating performance and as a guide to making decisions about future investments.\nMFFO\nAs defined by the Investment Program Association ( IPA\u201d), MFFO is a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure used to assist us in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that MFFO is helpful as a measure of ongoing operating performance because it excludes costs that management considers more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO. Compared to FFO, MFFO additionally excludes items such as acquisition related costs, straight-line rent and amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles. In addition, there are certain other MFFO adjustments as defined by the IPA that are not applicable to us at this time and\nare not included in our presentation of MFFO. We believe that excluding acquisition costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with our analysis of the operating performance of our portfolio over time, including periods after our acquisition stage.\nWe use FFO and MFFO, among other things: (i) to evaluate and compare the potential performance of the portfolio after the acquisition phase is complete, and (ii) as metrics in evaluating our ongoing distribution policy. We believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analyses and evaluation with these same performance metrics used by us in planning and executing our business strategy. We believe that these performance metrics will assist investors in evaluating the potential performance of the portfolio after the completion of the acquisition phase. However, these supplemental, non-GAAP measures are not necessarily indicative of future performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or to net cash flows from operating activities and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Neither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments used to calculate MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT, or a regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-traded REIT industry at which point we may adjust our calculation and characterization of MFFO.\nThe following unaudited table presents a reconciliation of net loss to FFO and MFFO:\n\nWe believe that our FFO for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as compared to our distributions declared for the same period, is not indicative of future performance as we are in the development and acquisition phase of our life cycle. In addition, FFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $1,499,234 of below market intangible lease income for The Sports Authority, Inc. in relation to its lease termination.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments in accordance with our investment strategy and policies, make distributions to our stockholders, redeem shares of our common stock pursuant to our redemption plan, pay our offering and operating fees and expenses and pay interest on any outstanding indebtedness.\nOver time, we generally intend to fund our cash needs for items, other than asset acquisitions, from operations. Our cash needs for acquisitions will be funded primarily from the sale of shares of our common stock in our offerings, and the amount we may raise in such offerings is uncertain. We commenced our follow-on offering on July 12, 2016. We intend to contribute any additional net proceeds from our offerings that are not used or retained to pay the fees and expenses attributable to our operations to our operating partnership. Since our inception through December 31, 2016, we raised $105,507,959 from the sales of shares of our common stock, of which $10,200,000 of our Class I shares were purchased by RREEF America.\nWe may also satisfy our cash needs for acquisitions through the assumption or incurrence of debt. On May 1, 2013, we, as guarantor, and our operating partnership, as borrower, entered into a secured revolving credit facility with Regions\nBank and its affiliates, as administrative agent, sole lead arranger and sole book runner, and other lending institutions that could have become parties to the credit agreement, which we refer to as the Regions line of credit. The Regions line of credit had a capacity of $50,000,000. Borrowings under the Regions line of credit carried a specified interest rate which ranged from 220 to 250 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. The Regions line of credit had a scheduled maturity date of May 1, 2015.\nOn March 6, 2015, we entered into a new secured revolving line of credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, which we refer to as the Wells Fargo line of credit. Upon closing, we borrowed $43,426,851which was used to fully repay and retire the Regions line of credit. The Wells Fargo line of credit has a three-year term with two one-year extension options exercisable by us upon satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of applicable extension fees. The interest rate under the Wells Fargo line of credit is based on the 1-month LIBOR with a spread of 170 to 190 basis points depending on the debt yield as defined in the agreement. The Wells Fargo line of credit had an initial maximum capacity of $75 million, but could be expanded up to a maximum capacity of $150 million upon satisfaction of specified conditions. Each requested expansion must be for at least $25 million and may result in the Wells Fargo line of credit being syndicated. On September 27, 2016, we expanded the maximum capacity of the Wells Fargo line of credit by $25,000,000 to a maximum capacity of $100,000,000. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance and weighted average interest rate under the Wells Fargo line of credit were $65,200,000 and 2.40%, respectively.\nThe Wells Fargo line of credit has as co-borrowers certain wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership, with our Company serving as the guarantor. The borrowing capacity under the Wells Fargo line of credit is based on the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 65% of the aggregate value of the properties in the collateral pool as determined by lender appraisals, (2) an amount that results in a minimum debt yield of 11% based on the in-place net operating income of the collateral pool, or (3) the maximum capacity of the Wells Fargo line of credit. Proceeds from the Wells Fargo line of credit can be used to fund acquisitions, redeem shares pursuant to our redemption plan and for any other corporate purpose. The Wells Fargo line of credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, borrowing conditions and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including that there must be at least five properties in the collateral pool at all times, and the collateral pool must also meet specified concentration provisions, unless waived by the lender. In addition, the guarantor must meet tangible net worth hurdles. On March 22, 2016, we amended the Wells Fargo line of credit agreement, effective December 31, 2015, to revise the tangible net worth definition therein to reflect our property values at the lesser of cost or appraised value as determined by our independent valuation advisor. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nOn March 1, 2016, we, through an an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary as borrower, entered into a credit agreement providing for a $14.5 million secured, fully non-recourse loan with Nationwide Life Insurance Company, or Nationwide. The Nationwide loan is secured by The Flats at Carrs Hill, our 138 unit student housing apartment property in Athens, Georgia. The interest rate for the Nationwide loan is fixed at 3.63% with interest-only payments for the full term of the loan. The maturity date of the Nationwide loan is March 1, 2026 with no extension options. The Nationwide loan permits voluntary prepayment of the full amount of the loan at any time subject to payment of the applicable prepayment premium, which is (a) the greater of a yield maintenance calculation or 1.0% of the principal amount outstanding for prepayments occurring up to and including the 96th month of the term, (b) 2.0% of the principal amount outstanding for prepayments occurring during months 97 through 102 of the term, or (c) 1.0% of the principal amount outstanding for prepayments occurring during months 103 through 114 of the term. The Nationwide loan is prepayable at par during the last six months of the term. Additionally, the Nationwide loan contains a one-time option to be assumed by a new borrower subject to satisfaction, in Nationwide's sole discretion, of specified conditions and payment of a fee equal to 1.0% of the outstanding balance of the loan. Proceeds of $14,500,000 were applied to our Wells Fargo line of credit. Prior to closing of the Nationwide loan, The Flats at Carrs Hill served as additional collateral under the Wells Fargo line of credit.\nOn December 1, 2016, we, through an an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary as borrower, entered into a credit agreement with Hartford Life Insurance Company, or Hartford. Proceeds of $13,000,000 obtained from Hartford were used to repay outstanding balances under the Wells Fargo line of credit, thereby releasing Commerce Corner from the Wells Fargo line of credit. The Hartford loan is a secured, fully non-recourse loan with a term of seven years. The Hartford loan carries a fixed interest rate of 3.41% with interest-only payments for the first 24 months of the term, followed by principal and interest payments for the remainder of the term, based upon a 30-year amortization schedule.\nIn the future, as our assets increase, it may not be commercially feasible, or we may not be able to secure, an adequate line of credit to fund acquisitions, redemptions or other needs. Moreover, actual availability may be reduced at any given time if the values of our real estate or our marketable securities portfolio decline.\nExpense Payments by Our Advisor\nIn connection with our advisory agreement, our advisor agreed to pay all of our organization and offering costs through January 3, 2013, and certain of our organization and offering costs through January 3, 2014, all of which were incurred on our behalf (collectively, the \"Deferred O&O\"). These costs amounted to $4,618,318, and are being reimbursed to our advisor on a pro rata basis over a 60-month period that started January 3, 2014. However, such reimbursements will be limited to a cumulative amount that does not cause our total organization and offering costs with respect to our initial public offering to exceed 15% of the gross proceeds raised from our initial public offering at any time. As of December 31, 2016, the organization and offering costs paid by our advisor did not exceed the 15% limit. Through December 31, 2016, we have reimbursed RREEF America for $2,766,943 for Deferred O&O.\nAlso pursuant to the advisory agreement, our advisor is entitled to reimbursement of certain costs incurred by our advisor or its affiliates that are not incurred under the expense support agreement, as discussed below. Costs eligible for reimbursement, if they are not incurred under the expense support agreement, include most third-party operating expenses, salaries and related costs of its employees who perform services for us (but not those employees for which our advisor earns a separate fee or those employees who are our executive officers) and travel related costs for its employees who incur such costs on our behalf. We will reimburse our advisor for all expenses paid or incurred by our advisor in connection with the services provided to us, subject to the limitations described", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

We hold our properties, real estate-related assets and other investments through RREEF Property Operating Partnership, LP, or our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner.\nWe invest primarily in the office, industrial, retail and multifamily sectors of the commercial real estate industry in the United States. We may also invest in real estate-related assets, which include common and preferred stock of publicly traded REITs and other real estate companies, which we refer to as real estate equity securities,\u201d and debt investments backed by real estate, which we refer to as real estate loans.\u201d\nOur board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, our board has delegated to our advisor authority to manage our day-to-day business in accordance with our investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations.\nOn May 30, 2013, upon receipt of a purchase order from our sponsor for $10,000,000 of Class I shares of our common stock and the release to us of funds in the escrow account, we commenced operations. Prior to May 30, 2013, we had neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues. Our entire activity from our inception date through May 30, 2013 was to prepare for and implement our public offering of our common stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we accomplished the following:\n \u2022 Acquired one medical office property outside of Boston, Massachusetts, for $34,000,000, increasing both our geographic and property type diversification; \n \u2022 Expanded our Wells Fargo line of credit to a maximum capacity of $100,000,000; \n \u2022 Maintained 100% occupancy in the real estate portfolio; \n \u2022 Secured two fully non-recourse, fixed-rate loans totaling $27.5 million on two separate properties; \n \u2022 Successfully launched our follow-on public offering; and \n \u2022 Raised approximately $27.6 million of new capital from investors. \nFurther detail on these activities is provided below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nPortfolio Information\nReal Estate Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2016, our real estate portfolio was comprised of eight properties diversified across geography and sector. Details of the properties acquired in the past three years are shown below.\n2014 Acquisitions\nOn April 11, 2014, we acquired a fee simple interest in an industrial building and an adjacent lot located in Logan Township, New Jersey ( Commerce Corner\u201d) for a purchase price of $19,750,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded\nthis acquisition with existing capital and $17,600,000 from our line of credit. Of the $17,600,000 borrowed, $8,760,000 was from existing borrowing capacity on previously acquired properties, while $8,840,000 was allocated to Commerce Corner. Commerce Corner is a 259,910 square-foot industrial building located on a 14.4 acre site at 1109 Commerce Boulevard, plus an additional adjacent 9.7 acre parcel of land which is partially utilized by one of the tenants for additional trailer parking.

Among other amenities, The Flats at Carrs Hill features a full-size indoor basketball court, multiple lounges, a 24-hour fitness center and a pool. Additionally, UGA recently approved an expansion of the North Oconee River Greenway trail, a 3.65 mile walking and biking path, which will provide the student residents direct pedestrian access to additional parts of campus.\nOn December 21, 2015, we acquired a fee simple interest in an office building located in Sterling, Virginia (\"Loudoun Gateway\") for a purchase price of $21,950,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded the acquisition with existing capital and by borrowing $20,000,000 from our line of credit.

Dining, entertainment and shopping facilities in Dulles Town Center, Dulles Town Crossing, Dulles 28 Centre, and Reston Town Center are all within short driving distances of Loudoun Gateway.\n2016 Acquisition\nOn September 27, 2016, we acquired a fee simple interest in a medical office building located in Dedham, Massachusetts (\"Allied Drive\") for a purchase price of $34,000,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded the acquisition with cash on hand and a $32,400,000 borrowing from our Wells Fargo line of credit.

The retail portion comprises the majority of the rental revenue for the property.\nReal Estate Equity Securities Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2016, our real estate equity securities portfolio consisted of publicly traded common stock of 40 REITs with a value of $8,609,212. We believe that investing a portion of our proceeds from our offering into a diversified portfolio of common and preferred shares of REITs and other real estate operating companies will provide our overall portfolio flexibility with near-term liquidity as well as potentially enhance our NAV over a longer period. The real estate equity securities portfolio is regularly reviewed and evaluated to determine whether the marketable securities held at any time continue to serve their original intended purposes.\nThe following chart summarizes our marketable securities by property type as of December 31, 2016:\nAs of December 31, 2016, our top ten holdings in our real estate equity securities portfolio were as follows:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Security\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Securities Portfolio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simon Property Group, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prologis, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public Storage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Welltower, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vornado Realty Trust\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Growth Properties, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Essex Property Trust, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarket Outlook\nCommercial real estate had a strong year during 2016. For the most part, demand continued to outstrip supply, pushing vacancy rates lower and rents higher. Commercial real estate prices generally ended the year above where they started, delivering total returns to core real estate in line with the historical average for commercial real estate. In more subtle ways, however, we believe the landscape began to shift. While fundamentals were strong, financial-market volatility curbed the decline of capitalization rates that had powered capital gains since 2010. Total annual returns on an unleveraged basis slipped into the single digits for the first time since the recent financial crisis.\nWe believe that commercial real estate will deliver a similar return profile over the next five years. Given that supply is generally moderate and shows tentative signs of peaking, we believe that real estate is positioned to generate healthy net operating income growth. At the same time, rising interest rates and temperate capital flows directly into commercial real estate are expected to put modest upward pressure on capitalization rates, slowing the pace of appreciation. We expect\ntotal annual unleveraged returns on commercial real estate will be primarily income driven, averaging 5%-6% annually through 2021 (6%-7% over the next two years).\nWhile a more normalized return profile may be disappointing to some investors, in our view it represents a soft landing that should be welcomed. We believe the U.S. economy does not suffer from overt excesses, such as inflation or asset bubbles, that have precipitated past recessions. We believe supply is generally under control, real estate is not over-leveraged and valuations are not stretched on a relative basis. In this context, a moderation of returns should help extend the duration of the cycle, or in a worst case scenario, cushion the severity of any downturn, which we continue to believe is several years off.\nResults of Operations\nWe commenced operations on May 30, 2013 upon receipt of $10,000,000 in proceeds from our sponsor in our initial public offering. On May 31, 2013, we acquired our first property and made our initial investments in marketable securities. Since then and through December 31, 2016, we acquired seven additional properties and significantly increased our outstanding debt balance as described above under \"Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio.\" In addition, we expect to continue to raise additional capital, increase our borrowings and make future acquisitions, which we believe will have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenues\nOur rental income increased to $15,102,464 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $8,050,514 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our tenant reimbursement income increased to $1,514,772 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $1,066,073 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our 2016 rental and tenant reimbursement income increased from 2015 due to the property acquisitions occurring during 2015 and 2016 as described above under \"Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio.\" Also included in our 2016 rental and tenant reimbursement income is approximately $1,499,234 related to the fully amortized below market lease liability at Terra Nova Plaza for The Sports Authority, Inc. In connection with the bankruptcy proceedings of The Sports Authority, Inc., on June 29, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. won the right at auction to assume and/or negotiate a new lease for the space at Terra Nova Plaza occupied by The Sports Authority, Inc. In September 2016, we executed a 10-year lease with Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., which was subsequently approved by the bankruptcy court on September 26, 2016 at which time Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. became the tenant, effectively terminating the lease with The Sports Authority, Inc. At such time, all remaining lease intangibles related to The Sports Authority, Inc. were fully amortized through the lease termination date.\nStraight line revenues increased to $836,108 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $431,065 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in straight line revenues for 2016 over 2015 was due to our additional property acquisitions. Typically, our leases have contractual base rent increases, which cause corresponding decreases in the straight line rent adjustments once effective. In addition, we recognized approximately $264,000 of straight line revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the lease with Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., a result of the lease beginning in September 2016 but cash base rent not commencing until March 1, 2017.\nHeritage Parkway, Wallingford Plaza, Commerce Corner, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza and Terra Nova Plaza represent our same-store real estate investments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, being the properties owned for the entirety of both periods. For those properties, property income was up $1,622,000 in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to $1,499,234 from the full amortization of the below market lease liability related to the termination of the lease with The Sports Authority, Inc. as described above. Base rental income had a minimal change over the prior period as contractual base rent increases at the properties were offset by three months of free rent at Terra Nova Plaza related to the lease with Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. Straight line revenue increased by approximately $125,000, primarily a result of the $264,000 recognized from the Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. lease offsetting decreases from the other properties. In addition, the 2016 period saw increased tenant reimbursements of approximately $57,000 primarily related similar increases in recoverable operating expenses.\nOur investment income on marketable securities increased to $484,912 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $284,627 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in investment income was due to certain securities providing greater distributions in 2016 as a result of asset sales. Such greater distributions may not continue in future periods. The portfolio is regularly adjusted by increasing and decreasing specific holdings primarily based upon\nchanges in sector allocations and to a lesser degree based upon performance of specific securities. Proceeds from sale of securities are primarily reinvested in the common stock of other publicly traded REITs, thereby keeping a base of investments that generate dividend income. As of December 31, 2016, our real estate equity securities portfolio had a total investment cost of $8,103,761. All of our investment income on marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was comprised of dividend income from these investments.\nExpenses\nOur total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $19,214,799 and $10,310,944, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses were $2,091,416 and $2,012,137, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses include a variety of corporate expenses, the largest of which were audit fees, legal fees, professional fees, directors and officers insurance and independent director compensation. The amount for the 2016 period is higher than 2015 primarily due to higher audit fees and other professional fees related to tax and compliance.\nProperty operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $5,158,942 and $2,118,849, respectively. The increase in property operating expenses from 2015 to 2016 is primarily due to the 2015 property acquisitions occurring late in the year as described above under \"Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio.\" In addition, we recognized approximately $545,000 of bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the bankruptcy filing of The Sports Authority, Inc. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, depreciation was $3,826,198 and $2,233,667, respectively and amortization was $6,803,850 and $2,735,138, respectively. Depreciation and amortization also increased in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period as a result of the additional acquisitions. Furthermore, the 2016 period includes $1,898,000 in amortization expense due to the full amortization of the acquired intangible lease assets related to The Sports Authority, Inc. lease.\nOn a same-store basis (for Heritage Parkway, Wallingford Plaza, Commerce Corner, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza and Terra Nova Plaza), property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by approximately $628,000 compared to the same period of 2015 primarily due to $545,000 of bad debt expense and, to a lesser degree, legal costs, at Terra Nova Plaza related to the bankruptcy of The Sports Authority, Inc. In addition, we recognized increased real estate taxes of approximately $40,000, primarily related to Commerce Corner. On a same-store basis, amortization increased approximately $1,854,000, primarily due to the additional amortization related to The Sports Authority Inc. lease as noted above, however, depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe fixed component of the advisory fee is equal to 1% per annum of the NAV for each share class and is calculated and accrued daily and reflected in our NAV per share. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fixed component of the advisory fee was $900,726 and $607,614, respectively. The fixed component of the advisory fee was not earned by our advisor until our combined NAV for all share classes reached $50,000,000, which occurred on January 22, 2015. The increase in the fixed component of the advisory fee is due to the additional capital raised during 2016 as well as an increase to our NAV resulting from appreciation of our real estate investments.\nIn accordance with our advisory agreement, our advisor can earn the performance component of the advisory fee when the total return to stockholders exceeds a required 6% per annum hurdle. The performance component is calculated separately for each share class and is comprised of the distributions paid to stockholders in each share class combined with the change in price of each share class. The performance component of the advisory fee for each share class is equal to 25% of the excess total return (the portion above the 6% per annum hurdle) allocable to such class; provided that in no event will the performance component exceed 10% of the aggregate total return allocable to such class for such year. The performance component of the advisory fee is payable annually based on the results for the entire calendar year. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the performance component exceeded the 6% per annum hurdle for at least one of the share classes. However, our advisor waived the performance component of the advisory fee for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the performance component of the advisory fee was $274,905. The actual performance component that our advisor could earn in the future depends on several factors, including but not limited to the performance of our investments, our expenses and interest rates.\nAcquisition related expenses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $158,762 and $603,539, respectively. The 2016 amount related to our acquisition of Allied Drive and the 2015 amount related primarily to our acquisitions of The Flats at Carrs Hill and Loudoun Gateway. Acquisition related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 also included costs related to pursuit of acquisitions that we ultimately decided not to complete.\nWe expect our acquisition related expenses, depreciation, amortization and property operating expenses to increase in future periods because we anticipate acquiring additional properties in the future.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense was $2,427,110 compared to $1,330,601 for the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to a greater weighted average outstanding aggregate loan balance due to additional borrowings on our line of credit related to acquisitions which occurred in the second half of 2015 and late 2016. The weighted average outstanding balance on our line of credit was $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our weighted average balance on our line of credit was attributable to our ownership of a greater number of properties during 2016 as compared to 2015. Additionally contributing to the increased interest expense in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period is the long term property specific loans that were originated in 2016. On March 1, 2016, we originated a $14,500,000 loan for The Flats at Carrs Hill which has a fixed interest rate of 3.63%. In addition, on December 1, 2016, we originated a $13,000,000 loan for Commerce Corner which has a fixed interest rate of 3.41%. Interest expense is greater from these loans as the interest rates are slightly higher than the 2.1% - 2.4% interest rate on the Wells Fargo line of credit, and there is additional amortization of financing costs associated with these fixed rate loans. Lastly, the increase in overall interest expense from 2015 to 2016 was partly due to the imputation of interest of $209,772 on our note to affiliate. Because we reached our maximum expense support of $9,200,000 from our advisor as of December 31, 2015, the repayment provisions of the expense support agreement were triggered in January 2016, causing us to impute interest on the payment stream. We expect our interest expense to increase in future periods because we anticipate acquiring additional properties with borrowings in the future. However, as we acquire additional properties and finance a portion of those properties with borrowings under our line of credit, we expect our line of credit fees to decrease. In addition, we anticipate utilizing additional property specific debt as a form of permanent financing along with continuing to use the line of credit to acquire additional properties.\nRealized and Unrealized Losses from Marketable Securities\nOur portfolio of investments in publicly-traded REIT securities is subject to continual adjustments in positions held as the portfolio is actively managed among different sectors. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, these portfolio refinements resulted in net realized gains of $193,285 and $12,635, respectively. During 2016, the REIT securities market generally gained ground during the first half, followed by a somewhat negative second half of the year due to expectations of a rise in interest rates as well as the uncertainty of the presidential election. During 2015, the REIT stock sector declined generally, primarily as a result of interest rate fears, the Greek debt situation and a slowing Chinese economy, although by the end of 2015, these fears had tempered and the public REIT sector finished the year by recovering the losses and adding further gains resulting in unrealized gains. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2016, our securities portfolio experienced a net unrealized loss of $189,989, while the year ended December 31, 2015 experienced a net unrealized gain of $105,958. As of December 31, 2016, we owned a portfolio of publicly traded common stock of 40 REITs with a cost basis of $8,103,761 and a fair value of $8,609,212, reflecting a net unrealized gain of $505,451.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nOur rental income increased to $8,050,514 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4,591,711 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our tenant reimbursement income increased to $1,066,073 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $593,845 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our 2015 rental and tenant reimbursement income increased from 2014 due to the property acquisitions occurring during 2014 and 2015 as described above under \"Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio.\" Straight line revenues increased to $431,065 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $342,643 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in straight line revenues for 2015 over 2014 is reflective of our additional property acquisitions.\nWallingford Plaza and Heritage Parkway represent our only same-store real estate investments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, being the only properties owned for the entirety of the periods. For those properties, other property income was down $40,000 in 2015 compared to 2014, due to a one-time easement fee received in 2014 at Wallingford Plaza from the adjacent property owner.\nOur investment income on marketable securities increased to $284,627 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $133,208 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in investment income was due to a larger average invested balance resulting from an increase in holdings over the prior year. We invested an additional $2,000,000 and $2,500,000 into our real estate equity securities portfolio during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The portfolio is regularly adjusted by increasing and decreasing specific holdings primarily based upon changes in sector allocations and, to a lesser degree, based upon performance of specific securities. Proceeds from sale of securities are reinvested in the common stock of other publicly traded REITs, thereby keeping a base of investments that generate dividend income. As of December 31, 2015, our real estate equity securities portfolio had a total investment cost of $7,873,564. All of our investment income on marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of dividend income from these investments.\nExpenses\nOur total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $10,310,944 and $6,131,581, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, general and administrative expenses were $2,012,137 and $2,232,336, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses include a variety of corporate expenses, the largest of which were audit fees, legal fees, directors and officers insurance, and independent director fees. The amount for 2015 was lower than for 2014 primarily due to our advisor's outsourcing of its fund administration services to BNY Mellon that occurred in February 2015. Prior to the switch to BNY Mellon, we were responsible for reimbursing our advisor for costs related to certain of our advisor's employees who were subsequently transitioned to BNY Mellon. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the fees incurred from BNY Mellon were approximately $313,000 less than the employee expense reimbursements to our advisor for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, professional and legal fees were reduced by approximately $148,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of fewer SEC-related consulting fees and more efficient internal processes. The aforementioned savings were offset by slightly higher audit costs due to increased activity and higher directors and officers insurance premiums as we increased our policy limits to be commensurate with our growth upon policy renewal in 2015.\nProperty operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $2,118,849 and $1,007,235, respectively. The increase was due to the acquisitions that occurred during 2014 and 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, depreciation was $2,233,667 and $1,097,034, respectively and amortization was $2,735,138 and $1,461,422, respectively, with the increases due to the additional properties acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nOn a same-store basis (for Wallingford Plaza and Heritage Parkway), property operating expenses, amortization and depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 were consistent with the year ended December 31, 2014, as the amounts for each category were materially unchanged for 2015 compared to 2014.\nThe fixed component of the advisory fee is equal to 1% per annum of the NAV for each share class and is calculated and accrued daily and reflected in our NAV per share. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fixed component of the advisory fee was $607,614 and zero, respectively. The fixed component of the advisory fee was not earned by our advisor until our combined NAV for all share classes reached $50,000,000, which occurred on January 22, 2015.\nIn accordance with our advisory agreement, our advisor can earn the performance component of the advisory fee when the total return to stockholders exceeds a required 6% per annum hurdle. The performance component is calculated separately for each share class and is comprised of the distributions paid to stockholders in each share class combined with the change in price of each share class. The performance component of the advisory fee for each share class is equal to 25% of the excess total return (the portion above the 6% per annum hurdle) allocable to such class; provided that in no event will the performance component exceed 10% of the aggregate total return allocable to such class for such year. The performance component of the advisory fee is payable annually based on the results for the entire calendar year. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the performance component exceeded the 6% per annum hurdle for at least one of the share classes. However, our advisor waived the performance component of the advisory fee for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The actual performance component that our advisor could earn in the future depends on several factors, including but not limited to the performance of our investments, the expenses of the Company and interest rates.\nAcquisition related expenses during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $603,539 and $333,554, respectively. The 2015 amount related primarily to our acquisitions of The Flats at Carrs Hill and Loudoun Gateway, while the 2014 amount related primarily to our acquisitions of Commerce Corner, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza, and Terra\nNova Plaza. Acquisition related expenses during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 also included costs related to pursuit of an acquisition that we ultimately decided not to complete.\nWe expect our acquisition related expenses, depreciation, amortization and property operating expenses to increase in future periods because we anticipate acquiring additional properties in the future.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense was $1,330,601 compared to $1,078,124 for the same period in 2014. This was due to an increase in the weighted average outstanding balance on our line of credit to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our weighted average balance on our line of credit was attributable to our ownership of a greater number of properties as of December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014, all of which were financed on our line of credit. We expect our interest expense to increase in future periods because (1) the interest expense reported during the periods presented reflects a lower average leverage level than we expect to maintain and (2) we anticipate acquiring additional properties in the future with borrowings. However, as we acquire additional properties and finance a portion of those properties with borrowings under our line of credit, we expect our line of credit fees to decrease. In addition, we anticipate utilizing property specific debt as a form of permanent financing along with continuing to use the line of credit to acquire additional properties.\nRealized and Unrealized Losses from Marketable Securities\nSince our initial investment in a portfolio of publicly traded REIT securities, our portfolio has been subject to continual refinements. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, these portfolio refinements resulted in net realized gains of $12,635 and $91,837, respectively. Compared to the 2014 period, the public REIT sector of the equities market continued to improve, however at a slower pace during 2015. During the 2014 calendar year, and into first quarter of 2015, the public REIT sector rose significantly on stable economic growth and interest rates. As a consequence, refinements in our marketable securities portfolio during both periods locked in realized gains that were not fully eliminated during the second quarter of 2015 when the REIT stock sector declined generally, primarily on interest rate fears, the Greek debt situation and a slowing Chinese economy. By the end of 2015, these fears had tempered and the public REIT sector finished the year by recovering the losses of the second quarter and adding further gains. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2015, our securities portfolio experienced a net unrealized gain of $105,958. The net unrealized gain for 2015 was less than the net unrealized gain of $765,053 for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily because the public REIT sector was coming off of a low at December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we owned a portfolio of publicly traded common stock of 44 REITs with a cost basis of $7,873,564 and a fair value of $8,569,004, reflecting a net unrealized gain of $695,440.\nInflation\nThe real estate property sector has not been affected significantly by inflation in the past several years due to the relatively low inflation rate. With the exception of leases with tenants in multifamily properties, we will seek to include provisions in our tenant leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market. Leases in multifamily properties generally turn over on an annual basis and do not typically present the same concerns regarding inflation protection due to their short-term nature.\nNet Asset Value (NAV) per Share\nWe commenced calculating our NAV per share for each class of shares on May 30, 2013, the day we commenced operations. We calculate NAV per share in accordance with the valuation guidelines approved by our board of directors for the purposes of establishing a price for shares sold in our public offering as well as establishing a redemption price.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the major components of our NAV per share as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of NAV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total NAV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Class A Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Class I Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Class T Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in real estate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182,900,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in real estate equity securities (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,609,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,031,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65,200,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.74\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.81\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.74\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,500,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.71\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,258,701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.44\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,582,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The value of our investments in real estate was approximately 6.9% more than their historical cost.\n(2) The value of our investments in real estate securities was approximately 6.2% more than their historical cost.\nAs of December 31, 2016, all properties were appraised by a third-party appraisal firm in addition to our independent valuation advisor. Set forth below are the weighted averages of the key assumptions used in the appraisals of the office properties (Heritage Parkway, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza, Loudoun Gateway and Allied Drive) and the retail properties (Wallingford Plaza and Terra Nova Plaza) as of December 31, 2016. Once we own more than one property for each of the industrial and multifamily property types, we will include the key assumptions for these property types.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Exit Capitalization Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office properties\n</td> <td>7.52%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.77%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail properties\n</td> <td>6.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.00%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese assumptions are determined by our independent valuation advisor or by separate third-party appraisers. A change in these assumptions would impact the calculation of the value of our office property investments. For example, assuming all other factors remain unchanged, an increase in the weighted-average discount rate used as of December 31, 2016 of 0.25% would yield a decrease in the total office property investment value of 2.2% and would yield a decrease in the total retail property investment value of 1.9%.\nThe table below sets forth a reconciliation of our stockholders' equity to our NAV as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total NAV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Class A Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Class I Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Class T Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,271,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unrealized gain on real estate investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,972,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Accumulated depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,349,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Accumulated amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,127,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Deferred costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,306,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Deferred rent receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,445,992\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,582,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe deferred costs and expenses of $11,306,527 are initially excluded from the NAV calculation. This represents amounts payable to our advisor and dealer manager, but is less than the total amount payable to our advisor and dealer manager, as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, because (1) certain amounts payable to our advisor as of December 31, 2016 were recorded as assets and as such have no impact on our NAV as of December 31, 2016, and (2) the amount payable to our advisor and dealer manager as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet includes accrued operating expenses that are reimbursable to our advisor under the advisory agreement and accrued offering costs payable\nto our dealer manager, both of which have been deducted from our NAV as of December 31, 2016 and thus are not deferred. The deferred amounts will be included in the NAV calculation as such costs are reimbursed to our advisor or paid to our dealer manager in accordance with the relevant agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we reimbursed our advisor for $925,687 of deferred offering costs and expenses, which have been included as a deduction to our NAV calculation in a pro rata amount on a daily basis since these reimbursements began in January 2014. The deferred offering costs and expenses above additionally includes $2,352,711 in estimated future trailing fees that will be deducted from the NAV on a daily basis as and when they become payable to the dealer manager. These amounts have not yet been included in the calculation of our NAV because the timing and ultimate amount of the trailing fees to be paid are unknown and dependent on factors including how long the applicable shares remain outstanding. However, under GAAP, we have incurred a liability and have estimated future trailing fees of $2,352,711 as of December 31, 2016 based on shares then outstanding, which is reflected on our most recent consolidated balance sheet.\nLimitations and Risks\nAs with any valuation methodology, our methodology is based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different NAV per share. Accordingly, with respect to our NAV per share, we can provide no assurance that:\n \u2022 a stockholder would be able to realize this NAV per share upon attempting to resell his or her shares; \n \u2022 we would be able to achieve, for our stockholders, the NAV per share, upon a listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange, selling our real estate portfolio, or merging with another company; or \n \u2022 the NAV per share, or the methodologies relied upon to estimate the NAV per share, will be found by any regulatory authority to comply with any regulatory requirements.  Furthermore, the NAV per share was calculated as of a particular point in time. The NAV per share will fluctuate over time in response to, among other things, changes in real estate market fundamentals, capital markets activities, and attributes specific to the properties and leases within our portfolio.\nFunds from Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO\u201d)\nWe believe that FFO and MFFO in combination with net loss and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are useful supplemental performance measures that we use to evaluate our operating performance. However, these supplemental, non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or to net cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our performance and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. No single measure can provide users of financial information with sufficient information, and only our disclosures read as a whole can be relied upon to adequately portray our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, other REITs may define FFO and similar measures differently and thus choose to treat certain accounting line items in a manner different from us due to differences in investment and operating strategy or for other reasons.\nFFO\nAs defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure that excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization and the impact of certain non-recurring items such as realized gains and losses on sales of real estate. We believe FFO is a meaningful supplemental financial performance measure of our operating performance that is useful to investors because depreciation and amortization in accordance with GAAP implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Additionally, realized gains and losses on sales of real estate generally occur infrequently. As a result, excluding these items from FFO aids our analysis of our ongoing operations. We use FFO as an indication of our operating performance and as a guide to making decisions about future investments.\nMFFO\nAs defined by the Investment Program Association ( IPA\u201d), MFFO is a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure used to assist us in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that MFFO is helpful as a measure of ongoing operating performance because it excludes costs that management considers more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO. Compared to FFO, MFFO additionally excludes items such as acquisition related costs, straight-line rent and amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles. In addition, there are certain other MFFO adjustments as defined by the IPA that are not applicable to us at this time and\nare not included in our presentation of MFFO. We believe that excluding acquisition costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with our analysis of the operating performance of our portfolio over time, including periods after our acquisition stage.\nWe use FFO and MFFO, among other things: (i) to evaluate and compare the potential performance of the portfolio after the acquisition phase is complete, and (ii) as metrics in evaluating our ongoing distribution policy. We believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analyses and evaluation with these same performance metrics used by us in planning and executing our business strategy. We believe that these performance metrics will assist investors in evaluating the potential performance of the portfolio after the completion of the acquisition phase. However, these supplemental, non-GAAP measures are not necessarily indicative of future performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or to net cash flows from operating activities and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Neither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments used to calculate MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT, or a regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-traded REIT industry at which point we may adjust our calculation and characterization of MFFO.\nThe following unaudited table presents a reconciliation of net loss to FFO and MFFO:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,346,476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,227,696\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,799,104\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate related depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,826,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,233,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,097,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate related amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,803,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,735,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,461,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAREIT defined FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,283,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,741,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>759,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>603,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight line rents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(607,900\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(431,065\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(342,643\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,816,111\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(372,391\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(119,906\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease incentive amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IPA defined MFFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,045,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,541,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>630,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that our FFO for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as compared to our distributions declared for the same period, is not indicative of future performance as we are in the development and acquisition phase of our life cycle. In addition, FFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $1,499,234 of below market intangible lease income for The Sports Authority, Inc. in relation to its lease termination.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments in accordance with our investment strategy and policies, make distributions to our stockholders, redeem shares of our common stock pursuant to our redemption plan, pay our offering and operating fees and expenses and pay interest on any outstanding indebtedness.\nOver time, we generally intend to fund our cash needs for items, other than asset acquisitions, from operations. Our cash needs for acquisitions will be funded primarily from the sale of shares of our common stock in our offerings, and the amount we may raise in such offerings is uncertain. We commenced our follow-on offering on July 12, 2016. We intend to contribute any additional net proceeds from our offerings that are not used or retained to pay the fees and expenses attributable to our operations to our operating partnership. Since our inception through December 31, 2016, we raised $105,507,959 from the sales of shares of our common stock, of which $10,200,000 of our Class I shares were purchased by RREEF America.\nWe may also satisfy our cash needs for acquisitions through the assumption or incurrence of debt. On May 1, 2013, we, as guarantor, and our operating partnership, as borrower, entered into a secured revolving credit facility with Regions\nBank and its affiliates, as administrative agent, sole lead arranger and sole book runner, and other lending institutions that could have become parties to the credit agreement, which we refer to as the Regions line of credit. The Regions line of credit had a capacity of $50,000,000. Borrowings under the Regions line of credit carried a specified interest rate which ranged from 220 to 250 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. The Regions line of credit had a scheduled maturity date of May 1, 2015.\nOn March 6, 2015, we entered into a new secured revolving line of credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, which we refer to as the Wells Fargo line of credit. Upon closing, we borrowed $43,426,851which was used to fully repay and retire the Regions line of credit. The Wells Fargo line of credit has a three-year term with two one-year extension options exercisable by us upon satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of applicable extension fees. The interest rate under the Wells Fargo line of credit is based on the 1-month LIBOR with a spread of 170 to 190 basis points depending on the debt yield as defined in the agreement. The Wells Fargo line of credit had an initial maximum capacity of $75 million, but could be expanded up to a maximum capacity of $150 million upon satisfaction of specified conditions. Each requested expansion must be for at least $25 million and may result in the Wells Fargo line of credit being syndicated. On September 27, 2016, we expanded the maximum capacity of the Wells Fargo line of credit by $25,000,000 to a maximum capacity of $100,000,000. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance and weighted average interest rate under the Wells Fargo line of credit were $65,200,000 and 2.40%, respectively.\nThe Wells Fargo line of credit has as co-borrowers certain wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership, with our Company serving as the guarantor. The borrowing capacity under the Wells Fargo line of credit is based on the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 65% of the aggregate value of the properties in the collateral pool as determined by lender appraisals, (2) an amount that results in a minimum debt yield of 11% based on the in-place net operating income of the collateral pool, or (3) the maximum capacity of the Wells Fargo line of credit. Proceeds from the Wells Fargo line of credit can be used to fund acquisitions, redeem shares pursuant to our redemption plan and for any other corporate purpose. The Wells Fargo line of credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, borrowing conditions and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including that there must be at least five properties in the collateral pool at all times, and the collateral pool must also meet specified concentration provisions, unless waived by the lender. In addition, the guarantor must meet tangible net worth hurdles. On March 22, 2016, we amended the Wells Fargo line of credit agreement, effective December 31, 2015, to revise the tangible net worth definition therein to reflect our property values at the lesser of cost or appraised value as determined by our independent valuation advisor. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nOn March 1, 2016, we, through an an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary as borrower, entered into a credit agreement providing for a $14.5 million secured, fully non-recourse loan with Nationwide Life Insurance Company, or Nationwide. The Nationwide loan is secured by The Flats at Carrs Hill, our 138 unit student housing apartment property in Athens, Georgia. The interest rate for the Nationwide loan is fixed at 3.63% with interest-only payments for the full term of the loan. The maturity date of the Nationwide loan is March 1, 2026 with no extension options. The Nationwide loan permits voluntary prepayment of the full amount of the loan at any time subject to payment of the applicable prepayment premium, which is (a) the greater of a yield maintenance calculation or 1.0% of the principal amount outstanding for prepayments occurring up to and including the 96th month of the term, (b) 2.0% of the principal amount outstanding for prepayments occurring during months 97 through 102 of the term, or (c) 1.0% of the principal amount outstanding for prepayments occurring during months 103 through 114 of the term. The Nationwide loan is prepayable at par during the last six months of the term. Additionally, the Nationwide loan contains a one-time option to be assumed by a new borrower subject to satisfaction, in Nationwide's sole discretion, of specified conditions and payment of a fee equal to 1.0% of the outstanding balance of the loan. Proceeds of $14,500,000 were applied to our Wells Fargo line of credit. Prior to closing of the Nationwide loan, The Flats at Carrs Hill served as additional collateral under the Wells Fargo line of credit.\nOn December 1, 2016, we, through an an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary as borrower, entered into a credit agreement with Hartford Life Insurance Company, or Hartford. Proceeds of $13,000,000 obtained from Hartford were used to repay outstanding balances under the Wells Fargo line of credit, thereby releasing Commerce Corner from the Wells Fargo line of credit. The Hartford loan is a secured, fully non-recourse loan with a term of seven years. The Hartford loan carries a fixed interest rate of 3.41% with interest-only payments for the first 24 months of the term, followed by principal and interest payments for the remainder of the term, based upon a 30-year amortization schedule.\nIn the future, as our assets increase, it may not be commercially feasible, or we may not be able to secure, an adequate line of credit to fund acquisitions, redemptions or other needs. Moreover, actual availability may be reduced at any given time if the values of our real estate or our marketable securities portfolio decline.\nExpense Payments by Our Advisor\nIn connection with our advisory agreement, our advisor agreed to pay all of our organization and offering costs through January 3, 2013, and certain of our organization and offering costs through January 3, 2014, all of which were incurred on our behalf (collectively, the \"Deferred O&O\"). These costs amounted to $4,618,318, and are being reimbursed to our advisor on a pro rata basis over a 60-month period that started January 3, 2014. However, such reimbursements will be limited to a cumulative amount that does not cause our total organization and offering costs with respect to our initial public offering to exceed 15% of the gross proceeds raised from our initial public offering at any time. As of December 31, 2016, the organization and offering costs paid by our advisor did not exceed the 15% limit. Through December 31, 2016, we have reimbursed RREEF America for $2,766,943 for Deferred O&O.\nAlso pursuant to the advisory agreement, our advisor is entitled to reimbursement of certain costs incurred by our advisor or its affiliates that are not incurred under the expense support agreement, as discussed below. Costs eligible for reimbursement, if they are not incurred under the expense support agreement, include most third-party operating expenses, salaries and related costs of its employees who perform services for us (but not those employees for which our advisor earns a separate fee or those employees who are our executive officers) and travel related costs for its employees who incur such costs on our behalf. We will reimburse our advisor for all expenses paid or incurred by our advisor in connection with the services provided to us, subject to the limitations described"}
