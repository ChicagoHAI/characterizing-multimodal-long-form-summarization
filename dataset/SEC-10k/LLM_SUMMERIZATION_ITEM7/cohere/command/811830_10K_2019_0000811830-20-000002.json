SHUSA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and the Bank's main office is in Wilmington, Delaware. SC is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Santander. SHUSA is also the parent company of Santander BanCorp , a holding company headquartered in Puerto Rico that offers a full range of financial services through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, BSPR; SSLLC, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in Boston; BSI, a financial services company headquartered in Miami that offers a full range of banking services to foreign individuals and corporations based primarily in Latin America; SIS, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in New York providing services in investment banking, institutional sales, trading and offering research reports of Latin American and European equity and fixed-income securities; and several other subsidiaries. SSLLC, SIS and another SHUSA subsidiary, Santander Asset Management, LLC, are registered investment advisers with the SEC.\nThe Bank's principal markets are in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. The Bank uses its deposits, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios. The Bank earns interest income on its loan and investment portfolios. In addition, the Bank generates non-interest income from a number of sources, including deposit and loan services, sales of loans and investment securities, capital markets products and BOLI. The principal non-interest expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and facility-related costs, technology and other administrative expenses. The financial results of the Bank are affected by the economic environment, including interest rates and consumer and business confidence and spending, as well as the competitive conditions within the Bank's geographic footprint.\nSC is a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing. SC's primary business is the indirect origination and securitization of RICs, principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to subprime retail consumers. Further information about SC's business is provided below in the Chrysler Capital\u201d section.\nSC is managed through a single reporting segment which included vehicle financial products and services, including RICs, vehicle leases, and dealer loans, as well as financial products and services related to recreational and marine vehicles and other consumer finance products.\nSC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, SC has other relationships through which it holds other consumer finance products. However, in 2015, SC announced its exit from personal lending and, accordingly, all of its personal lending assets are classified as HFS at December 31, 2019.\nChrysler Capital\nSince May 2013, under the ten-year private label financing agreement with FCA that became effective May 1, 2013 (the \"Chrysler Agreement\"), SC has operated as FCA's preferred provider for consumer loans, leases and dealer loans and provides services to FCA customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand. These products and services include consumer RICs and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit.\nChrysler Capital continues to be a focal point of the Company's strategy. On June 28, 2019, SC entered into an amendment to the Chrysler Agreement with FCA, which modified the Chrysler Agreement to, among other things, adjust certain performance metrics, exclusivity commitments and payment provisions under the Chrysler Agreement. The amendment also established an operating framework that is mutually beneficial for both parties for the remainder of the contract. The Company's average penetration rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 34%, an increase from 30% for the same period in 2018.\nSC has dedicated financing facilities in place for its Chrysler Capital business and has worked strategically and collaboratively with FCA to continue to strengthen its relationship and create value within the Chrysler Capital program. During the year ended December 31, 2019, SC originated $12.8 billion in Chrysler Capital loans, which represented 56% of the UPB of its total RIC originations, with an approximately even share between prime and non-prime, as well as $8.5 billion in Chrysler Capital leases. Additionally, substantially all of the leases originated by SC during the year ended December 31, 2019 were under the Chrysler Agreement. Since its May 2013 launch, Chrysler Capital has originated more than $65.9 billion in retail loans (excluding the SBNA RIC origination program) and purchased $41.9 billion in leases.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nOverview\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, unemployment remained low and year-to-date market results were positive, recovering from a volatile fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe unemployment rate at December 31, 2019 was 3.5% compared to 3.5% at September 30, 2019, and was lower compared to 3.9% one year ago. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment rose in the retail trade, and healthcare, while mining employment decreased.\nThe BEA advance estimate indicates that real gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.1% for the fourth quarter of 2019, consistent with the advance estimated growth of 2.1% for the third quarter of 2019. Growth continued to be driven by increases in personal consumption expenditures, federal government spending, and state and local government spending. In addition, imports, which are a subtraction to in the calculation of the gross domestic product, decreased. These positive contributions were offset by decreases to private inventory investment and non-residential fixed investments.\nMarket year-to-date returns for the following indices based on closing prices at December 31, 2019 were:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dow Jones Industrial Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P 500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASDAQ Composite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.8%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt its December 2019 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the federal funds rate target at 1.50%, to continue to support economic expansion, current strength in labor market conditions, and inflation near its targeted objective. Overall inflation remains below the targeted rate of 2.0%.\nThe ten-year Treasury bond rate at December 31, 2019 was 1.90%, down from 2.69% at December 31, 2018. Within the industry, changes in this metric are often considered to correspond to changes in 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates.\nCurrent mortgage origination and refinancing information is not yet available. Based on the most current information released based on September 2019 statistics, mortgage originations increased 29.74% year-over-year, which included an increased 6.21% in mortgage originations for home purchases and an increased 103.1% in mortgage originations from refinancing activity from the same period in 2018. These rates are representative of U.S. national average mortgage origination activity.\nThe ratio of NPLs to total gross loans for U.S. banks declined for six consecutive years, to just under 1.5% in 2015. NPL trends have remained relatively low since that time. NPLs for U.S. commercial banks were approximately 0.87% of loans using the latest available data, which was as of the third quarter of 2019, compared to 0.95% for the prior year.\nChanging market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the Company. The interest rate environment can present challenges in the growth of net interest income for the banking industry, which continues to rely on non-interest activities to support revenue growth. Changing market conditions and political uncertainty could have an overall impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Such conditions could also impact the Company's credit risk and the associated provision for credit losses and legal expense.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCredit Rating Actions\nThe following table presents Moody's, S&P and Fitch credit ratings for the Bank, BSPR, SHUSA, Santander, and the Kingdom of Spain, as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BANK\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BSPR(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHUSA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>Fitch\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>Fitch\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>Fitch\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa3\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-1\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>F-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-1/P-2\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>F-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>F-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SANTANDER\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SPAIN\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>Fitch\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>Fitch\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-1\n</td> <td>A-1\n</td> <td>F-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> <td>A-1\n</td> <td>F-1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) P-1 Short Term Deposit Rating; P-2 Short Term Debt Rating.\n(2) Outlook currently is Stable and under review with the possibility of a downgrade.\nMoody's announced completion of its periodic reviews and affirmed its ratings over SHUSA, SBNA and BSPR in March 2019. Spain in August 2019 and Santander in June 2019. Fitch affirmed its ratings and outlook for Spain in December 2019 and BSPR in October 2019.\nSHUSA funds its operations independently of the other entities owned by Santander, and believes its business is not necessarily closely related to the business or outlook of other entities owned by Santander. Future changes in the credit ratings of its parent, Santander, or the Kingdom of Spain, however, could impact SHUSA's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and any other change in the condition of Santander could affect SHUSA.\nAt this time, SC is not rated by the major credit rating agencies.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nThe activities of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank and SC, are subject to regulation under various U.S. federal laws and regulatory agencies which impose regulations, supervise and conduct examinations, and may affect the operations and management of the Company and its ability to take certain actions, including making distributions to our parent. The Company is regulated on a consolidated basis by the Federal Reserve, including the FRB of Boston, and the CFPB. The Company's banking and bank holding company subsidiaries are further supervised by the FDIC and the OCC. As a subsidiary of the Company, SC is also subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve as well as the CFPB. Santander BanCorp and BSPR also are supervised by the Puerto Rico Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions.\nPayment of Dividends\nSHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA and other consolidated subsidiaries, and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. SHUSA and SBNA are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain \"well-capitalized\" under prompt corrective action regulations. As a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, SC is included in various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends as described in the Stress Tests and Capital Adequacy\u201d discussion in this section. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A for detail of the capital actions of the Company and its subsidiaries during the period.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFBOs\nIn February 2014, the Federal Reserve issued the final rule implementing certain EPS mandated by the DFA. Under the Final Rule, FBOs with over $50 billion of U.S. non-branch assets, including Santander, were required to consolidate U.S. subsidiary activities under an IHC. In addition, the Final Rule required U.S. BHCs and FBOs with at least $50 billion in total U.S. consolidated non-branch assets to be subject to EPS and heightened capital, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements. Due to both its global and U.S. non-branch total consolidated asset size, Santander was subject to both of the above provisions of the Final Rule. As a result of this rule, Santander has transferred substantially all of its U.S. bank and non-bank subsidiaries previously outside the Company to the Company, which became an IHC effective July 1, 2016.\nEconomic Growth Act\nIn May 2018, the Economic Growth Act was signed into law. The Economic Growth Act scales back certain requirements of the DFA. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized a rulemaking implementing the changes required by the Economic Growth Act. The rulemaking provides a tailored approach to the EPS mandated by Section 165 of the DFA. Under the new tailored approach, banks are placed into different categories based on asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. The tailoring rule applies to both Santander and the Company. Both Santander and the Company were placed into Category four of the tailoring rule. The new tailored standards are discussed further below.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nU.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules are applicable to both SHUSA and the Bank and establish a comprehensive capital framework that includes both the advanced approaches for the largest internationally active U.S. banks, formerly known as Basel II, and a standardized approach that applies to all banking organizations with over $500 million in assets.\nThese rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and prompt corrective action thresholds that, when fully phased in, require banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter, of 4.0%. A further capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these minimum ratios was phased in effective January 1, 2019. This buffer is required for banking institutions and BHCs to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends.\nThese U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules include deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that MSRs, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities are deducted from CET1 to the extent any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 for the Company and the Bank began on January 1, 2015 and was initially planned over three years, with a fully phased-in requirement of January 1, 2018. However, during 2017, the regulatory agencies finalized changes to the capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2018. These changes extended the current treatment and deferred the final transition provision phase-in at non-advanced approach institutions for certain capital elements, and suspended the risk-weight to 100 percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital, in lieu of advancing to 250 percent. During 2019, the regulatory agencies approved a final rule which includes simplifications for non-advanced approaches to the generally applicable capital rules, specifically with regard to the treatment of minority interest, as well as modifying the risk-weight to 250 percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital. This final rule will become effective on April 1, 2020.\nSee the Bank Regulatory Capital section of this MD&A for the Company's capital ratios under Basel III standards. The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Company's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIf capital has reached the significantly or critically undercapitalized levels, further material restrictions can be imposed, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and, in critically undercapitalized situations, appointment of a receiver or conservator. Critically undercapitalized institutions generally may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt. All but well-capitalized institutions are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act and OCC regulations, institutions which are not categorized as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are restricted from making capital distributions, which include cash dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution. At December 31, 2019, the Bank met the criteria to be classified as well-capitalized.\u201d\nOn April 10, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a NPR seeking comment on a proposal to simplify capital rules for large banks. If finalized as proposed, the NPR would replace the capital conservation buffer. The capital conservation buffer would be replaced with a new SCB. The SCB is calculated as the maximum decline in CET1 in the severely adverse scenario (subject to a 2.5% floor) plus four quarters of dividends. The proposal would result in new regulatory capital minimums which are equal to 4.5% CET1 plus the SCB, any GSIB surcharge, and any countercyclical capital buffer. The GSIB buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to SHUSA. These new minimums would be firm-specific and would trigger restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses in the event a firm falls below their new minimums. Firms would still submit a capital plan annually. Supervisory expectations for capital planning processes would not change under the proposal. The Company does not expect this NPR, if finalized as proposed, to have a material impact on its current or future planned capital actions. This rule was finalized on March 4, 2020, and its impact is being evaluated.\nStress Testing and Capital Planning\nThe DFA also requires certain banks and BHCs, including the Company, to perform a stress test and submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve and receive a notice of non-objection before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. In June 2018, the Company announced that the Federal Reserve did not object to the planned capital actions described in the Company's capital plan through June 30, 2019. In February 2019, the Federal Reserve announced that SHUSA, as well as other less complex firms, would receive a one-year extension of the requirement to submit its capital plan until April 5, 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced that, for the period beginning July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, the Company would be allowed to make capital distributions up to the amount that would have allowed it to remain above all minimum capital requirements in CCAR 2018, adjusted for any changes in the Company's regulatory capital ratios since the Federal Reserve acted on the 2018 capital plan.\nIn October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that tailor the stress testing and capital actions a company is required to perform based on the company's asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. Under the tailoring rules, the Company is required to submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis. The Company is also subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle. The Company continues to evaluate planned capital actions in its annual capital plan and on an ongoing basis.\nLiquidity Rules\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC have established a rule to implement the Basel III LCR for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies, and a modified version of the LCR for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active. The LCR is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. Smaller covered companies (more than $50 billion in assets) such as the Company were required to calculate the LCR monthly beginning January 2016.\nIn October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that tailor the liquidity requirements based on a company's asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. In light of the fact that the Company is under $250 billion in assets and has less than $50 billion in short-term wholesale funding, the Company is no longer required to disclose the US LCR.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe NSFR is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon The NSFR requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on- and off-balance sheet activities, thereby reducing the likelihood that disruptions to a bank's regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity in a way that could increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress. In May 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule for NSFR applicable to U.S. financial institutions. The proposed rule has not been finalized, and the Company is currently evaluating the impact the proposed rule would have on its financial position, results of operations and disclosures.\nResolution Planning\nThe DFA requires all BHCs and FBOs with assets of $50 billion or more to prepare and regularly update resolution plans. The 165(d) Resolution Plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and that no extraordinary support\u201d is received from the U.S. or any other government. The most recent 165(d) Resolution Plan was submitted to the Federal Reserve and FDIC in December 2018. In addition, under amended Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act rules, the IDI resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of $50 billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors' rapid access to their insured deposits, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution. The most recent IDI resolution plan was submitted to the FDIC in June 2018. SHUSA and SBNA are currently awaiting feedback.\nTLAC\nThe TLAC Rule requires certain U.S. organizations to maintain a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments, including a minimum amount of unsecured LTD. The TLAC Rule applies to U.S. GSIBs and to IHCs with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important FBO. The Company is such an IHC.\nUnder the TLAC Rule, companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC, which consists of a minimum amount of LTD and Tier 1 capital. As a result, SHUSA must hold the higher of 18% of its RWAs or 9% of its total consolidated assets in the form of TLAC, of which 6% of its RWAs or 3.5% of total consolidated assets must consist of LTD. In addition, SHUSA must maintain a TLAC buffer composed solely of CET1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the TLAC buffer it maintains. The TLAC Rule became effective on January 1, 2019.\nVolcker Rule\nThe DFA added new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act, which is commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule.\u201d The Volcker Rule prohibits a banking entity\u201d from engaging in proprietary trading\u201d or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a Covered Fund: (i) acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in the Covered Fund; (ii) controlling the Covered Fund; or (iii) engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the Covered Fund. These prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities.\nBecause the term banking entity\u201d includes an IDI, a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates, the Volcker Rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as Santander, the Company, and certain of the Company's subsidiaries (including the Bank and SC), as well as other Santander subsidiaries in the United States and abroad.\nThe Company implemented certain policies and procedures, training programs, recordkeeping, internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the Volcker Rule. As required by the Volcker Rule, the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and Covered Fund activities. SHUSA's compliance program includes, among other things, processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the Volcker Rule, testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule.\nIn October 2019, the joint agencies responsible for administering the Volcker Rule finalized revisions to Volcker Rule. The final rule tailors the Volcker Rule's compliance requirements to the amount of a firm's trading activity, revise the definition of a trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and simplify the information companies are required to provide the banking agencies. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this final rule.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRisk Retention Rule\nIn December 2014, the Federal Reserve issued its final credit risk retention rule, which generally requires sponsors of ABS to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing ABS. SHUSA, primarily through SC, is an active participant in the structured finance markets and began to comply with the retention requirements effective in December 2016.\nMarket Risk Rule\nThe market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold risk-based regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions. The bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internal-risk based models. The market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the bank's internal risk based models, as well as qualitative requirements for the bank's management of market risk. Banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions.\nA bank is subject to the market risk capital rules if its consolidated trading activity, defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, equals the lesser of: (1) 10 percent or more of the bank's total assets as reported in its Call Report and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, or (2) $1 billion or more. At September 30, 2019, SBNA reported aggregate trading exposure in excess of the market risk threshold, and as a result, both the Company and SBNA began holding the market risk component within RWA of the risk-based capital ratios, and submitted the FFIEC 102 - Market Risk Regulatory Report beginning for the period ended December 31, 2019. The incorporation of market risk within regulatory capital has resulted in a decrease in the risk-based capital ratios.\nCapital Simplification Rule\nThe federal banking agencies are adopting a final rule that simplifies for non-advanced approaches banking organizations the generally applicable capital rules and makes a number of technical corrections. Specifically, it reverses the previous transition provision freeze on MSRs and deferred tax assets by modifying the risk-weight from 100% to 250%. The rule will also replace the existing methodology for calculating includible minority interest with a flat 10% limit at each capital level. The increased risk weighting presents an unfavorable decline to the Company's risk-based ratios, but it is estimated that the Tier 1 and total capital ratios will improve overall due to the additional minority interest includible under the simplified rule. The capital simplification rule becomes effective April 1, 2020; however, regulators have granted the option for institutions to adopt early on January 1, 2020. The Company plans to adopt this new rule on April 1, 2020.\nHeightened Standards\nOCC guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions are commonly referred to as heightened standards.\u201d The heightened standards apply to insured national banks with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. The heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions' boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework.\nTransactions with Affiliates\nDepository institutions must remain in compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve's Regulation W, which governs transactions of the Company and its banking subsidiaries with affiliated companies and individuals. Section 23A imposes limits on certain specified covered transactions,\u201d which include loans, lines, and letters of credit to affiliated companies or individuals, and investments in affiliated companies, as well as certain other transactions with affiliated companies and individuals. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to 10% of a bank's capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20% for all affiliates. Certain covered transactions also must meet collateral requirements that range from 100% to 130% depending on the type of transaction.\nSection 23B of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits a depository institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are considered arms'-length. To meet the definition of arm's-length, the terms of the transaction must be the same, or at least as favorable, as those for similar transactions with non-affiliated companies. As a U.S. domiciled subsidiary of a global parent with significant non-bank affiliates, the Company faces elevated compliance risk in this area.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRegulation AB II\nRegulation AB II, among other things, expanded disclosure requirements and modified the offering and shelf registration process for ABS. SC must comply with these rules, which impact all offerings of publicly registered ABS and all reports under the Exchange Act, for outstanding publicly-registered ABS, and affect SC's public securitization platform.\nCRA\nSBNA and BSPR are subject to the requirements of the CRA, which requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which it is located. BSPR's current CRA rating is Outstanding\u201d and SBNA's current CRA rating is \"Satisfactory.\" The OCC takes into account the Bank's CRA rating in considering certain regulatory applications the Bank makes, including applications related to establishing and relocating branches, and the Federal Reserve does the same with respect to certain regulatory applications the Company makes.\nOn December 12, 2019, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued the CRA NPR to modernize the regulatory framework implementing the CRA. The CRA NPR generally focuses on clarifying and expanding the activities that qualify for CRA consideration, providing benchmarks to determine what levels of activity are necessary to obtain a particular CRA rating, establishing additional assessment areas based on the location of a bank's deposits, and increasing clarity and consistency in reporting. The CRA NPR contemplates that regulators will provide a publicly available, non-exhaustive list of activities that would automatically receive CRA consideration. In addition, the CRA NPR allows banks to receive consideration for certain qualifying activities conducted outside their assessment areas. It currently is unclear when and in what manner the OCC and FDIC will finalize the CRA NPR.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nOn February 25, 2015, SC entered into a consent order with the DOJ, approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, which resolved the DOJ's claims against SC that certain of its repossession and collection activities during the period of time between January 2008 and February 2013 violated the SCRA. The consent order required SC to pay a civil fine in the amount of $55,000, as well as at least $9.4 million to affected service members, consisting of $10,000 per service member plus compensation for any lost equity (with interest) for each repossession by SC and $5,000 per service member for each instance where SC sought to collect repossession-related fees on accounts for which a repossession was conducted by a prior account-holder. The consent order required SC to undertake additional remedial measures. The consent order also subjected SC to monitoring by the DOJ for compliance with the SCRA for a period of five years. The consent order terminated as of February 26, 2019.\nOn March 21, 2017, SC and the Company entered into a written agreement with the FRB of Boston. Under the terms of that agreement, SC is required to enhance its compliance risk management program, board oversight of risk management and senior management oversight of risk management, and the Company is required to enhance its oversight of SC's management and operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, SSLLC had received 751 FINRA arbitration cases related to Puerto Rico bonds and Puerto Rico CEFs that SSLLC previously recommended and/or sold to clients. Most of these cases are based upon concerns regarding the local Puerto Rico securities market. The statements of claims allege, among other things, fraud, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, unsuitability, over-concentration and failure to supervise. There were 439 arbitration cases pending as of December 31, 2019. The Company has experienced a decrease in the volume of claims since September 30, 2019; however, it is reasonably possible that it could experience an increase in claims in future periods.\nOn August 8, 2019, bond insurers National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation and MBIA Insurance Corporation filed suit in Puerto Rico state court against eight Puerto Rico municipal bond underwriters, including SSLLC, alleging that the underwriters made misrepresentations in connection with the issuance of the debt and that the bond insurers relied on such misrepresentations in agreeing to insure certain of the bonds. The complaint alleges damages of not less than $720 million. The defendants removed the case to federal court, and plaintiffs have sought to return the case to state court.\nIn addition, SSLLC, Santander BanCorp, BSPR, the Company and Santander are defendants in a putative class action alleging federal securities and common law claims relating to the solicitation and purchase of more than $180 million of Puerto Rico bonds and $101 million of CEFs during the period from December 2012 to October 2013. The case is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and is captioned Jorge Ponsa-Rabell, et. al. v. SSLLC, Civ. No. 3:17-cv-02243. The amended complaint alleges that defendants acted in concert to defraud purchasers in connection with the underwriting and sale of Puerto Rico municipal bonds, CEFs and open-end funds. In May 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act\nPursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders.

Santander has undertaken significant steps to withdraw from the Iranian market, such as closing its representative office in Iran and ceasing all banking activities therein, including correspondent relationships, deposit-taking from Iranian entities and issuing export letters of credit, except for the legacy transactions described above. Santander is not contractually permitted to cancel these arrangements without either (i) paying the guaranteed amount (in the case of the performance guarantees), or (ii) forfeiting the outstanding amounts due to it (in the case of the export credits). As such, Santander intends to continue to provide the guarantees and hold these assets in accordance with company policy and applicable laws.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThis MD&A is based on the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, accordingly, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. However, the Company is not currently aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results. Management identified accounting for ALLL and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, estimates of expected residual values of leased vehicles subject to operating leases, accretion of discounts and subvention on RICs, goodwill, fair value measurements and income taxes as the Company's most critical accounting estimates, in that they are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nALLL for Loan Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\nThe ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments represent management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of SHUSA's ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is regularly evaluated. This evaluation process is subject to several estimates and applications of judgment. Management's evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb loan and lease losses takes into consideration the risks in the loan portfolio, past loan and lease loss experience, specific loans that have loss potential, geographic and industry concentrations, delinquency trends, economic conditions, the level of originations and other relevant factors. Management also considers loan quality, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, the amount of NPLs, and industry trends. Changes in these estimates could have a direct material impact on the provision for credit losses recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and/or could result in a change in the recorded allowance and reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The loan portfolio represents the largest asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the methodology used to determine the ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the periods presented is included in the Credit Risk Management section of this MD&A.\nThe ALLL includes: (i) an allocated allowance, which is comprised of allowances established on loans specifically evaluated for impairment and loans collectively evaluated for impairment, based on historical loan and lease loss experience adjusted for current trends general economic conditions and other risk factors, and (ii) an unallocated allowance to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process. Generally, the Company's loans held for investment are carried at amortized cost, net of the ALLL. The ALLL includes the estimate of credit losses to be realized during the loss emergence period based on the recorded investment in the loan, including net discounts that are expected at the time of charge-off. In the case of loans purchased in a bulk purchase or business combination, the entire discount on the loan portfolio is considered as available to absorb the credit losses when determining the ALLL. For these loans, the Company records provisions for credit losses when incurred losses exceed the unaccreted purchase discount. Reserve levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly.\nThe Company's allocated reserves are principally based on various models subject to the Company's Model Risk Management Framework. New models are approved by the Company's Model Risk Management Committee. Models, inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually, and the Company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Committee.\nThe Company's unallocated allowance is no more than 5% of the overall allowance. This is considered to be reasonably sufficient to absorb imprecisions of models to otherwise provide for coverage of inherent losses in the Company's entire loan and lease portfolio. Imprecisions include loss factors in the loan portfolio that may not have been discreetly contemplated in the general and specific components of the allowance, as well as potential variability in estimates. Period-to-period changes in the Company's historical unallocated ALLL positions are considered in light of these factors.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nValuation of Automotive Lease Assets and Residuals\nThe Company has significant investments in vehicles in SC's operating lease portfolio. In accounting for operating leases, management must make a determination at the beginning of the lease contract of the estimated realizable value (i.e., residual value) of the vehicle at the end of the lease. Residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to four years. At contract inception, the Company determines the projected residual value based on an internal evaluation of the expected future value. This evaluation is based on a proprietary model using internally-generated data that is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness. The customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a finance charge. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, the Company is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception. Management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of leased vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of leased assets.\nTo account for residual risk, the Company depreciates automobile operating lease assets to estimated realizable value on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The estimated realizable value is initially based on the residual value established at contract inception. Periodically, the Company revises the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and other relevant data points, and adjusts depreciation expense appropriately over the remaining term of the lease.\nThe Company periodically evaluates its investment in operating leases for impairment if circumstances, such as a systemic and material decline in used vehicle values occurs. These circumstances could include, for example, a decline in the residual value of our lease portfolio due to an event caused by shocks to oil and gas prices (which may have a pronounced impact on certain models of vehicles) or pervasive manufacturer defects (which may systemically affect the value of a particular brand or model). Impairment is determined to exist if the fair value of the leased asset is less than its carrying value and it is determined that the net carrying value is not recoverable. The net carrying value of a leased asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon eventual disposition. If our operating lease assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value as estimated by DCF. No such impairment was recognized in 2019, 2018, or 2017.\nThe Company's depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers management's expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination, which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values. The critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automobile lease assets include: (1) estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values, (2) proper identification and estimation of business conditions, (3) our remarketing abilities, and (4) automobile manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the value of the lease residuals. Expected residual values include estimates of payments from automobile manufacturers\nrelated to residual support and risk-sharing agreements, if any. To the extent an automotive manufacturer is not able to fully honor its obligation relative to these agreements, the Company's depreciation expense would be negatively impacted.\nAccretion of Discounts and Subvention on RICs\nLHFI include the RIC portfolio which consists largely of nonprime automobile loans, and which are primarily acquired individually from dealers at a nonrefundable discount from the contractual principal amount. The Company also pays dealer participation on certain receivables. The amortization of discounts, subvention payments from manufacturers, and other origination costs are recognized as adjustments to the yield of the related contracts. The Company applies significant assumptions, including prepayment speeds, in estimating the accretion rates used to approximate effective yield.\nThe Company estimates future principal prepayments specific to pools of homogeneous loans which are based on the vintage, credit quality at origination and term of the loan. Prepayments in our portfolio are sensitive to credit quality, with higher credit quality loans experiencing higher voluntary prepayment rates than lower credit quality loans. The impact of defaults is not considered in the prepayment rate; the prepayment rate only considers voluntary prepayments. The resulting prepayment rate specific to each pool is based on historical experience and is used as an input in the calculation of the constant effective yield.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGoodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the Company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities represents goodwill. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized on a recurring basis, but rather are subject to periodic impairment testing.\nAs more fully described in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. The Company conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 1, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. As of December 31, 2019, the reporting units with assigned goodwill were Consumer and Business Banking, C&I, CRE & VF, CIB, and SC.\nAn entity's quantitative goodwill impairment analysis must be completed unless the entity determines, based on certain qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, including goodwill, and that no impairment exists. An entity has an unconditional option to bypass the preceding qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test.\nThe quantitative analysis requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including its allocated goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value, impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. A recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit, and cannot subsequently be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers. The Company utilizes the market capitalization approach to determine the fair value of its SC reporting unit, as it is a publicly traded company that has a single reporting unit. Determining the fair value of the remaining reporting units requires significant valuation inputs, assumptions, and estimates.\nThe Company determines the carrying value of each reporting unit using a risk-based capital approach. Certain of the Company's assets are assigned to a Corporate/Other category. These assets are related to the Company's corporate-only programs, such as BOLI, and are not employed in or related to the operations of a reporting unit or considered in determining the fair value of a reporting unit.\nGoodwill impairment testing involves management's judgment, requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value. This is performed using widely-accepted valuation techniques, such as the guideline public company market approach (earnings and price-to-tangible book value multiples of comparable public companies), the market capitalization approach (share price of the reporting unit and control premium of comparable public companies), and the income approach (the DCF method). The Company uses a combination of these accepted methodologies to determine the fair valuation of reporting units. Several factors are taken into account, including actual operating results, future business plans, economic projections, and market data.\nThe guideline public company market approach (\"market approach\") includes earnings and price-to-tangible book value multiples of comparable public companies which were applied to the earnings and equity for all of the Company's reporting units. The market capitalization plus control premium approach was applied to the Company's SC reporting unit, as the SC reporting unit is a publicly traded subsidiary whose securities are traded in an active market.\nIn connection with the market capitalization plus control premium approach applied to the Company's SC reporting unit, the Company used SC's stock price as of the date of the annual impairment analysis. The Company also considered historical auto loan industry transactions and control premiums over the last three years in determining the control premium.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe DCF method of the income approach incorporates the reporting units' forecasted cash flows, including a terminal value to estimate the fair value of cash flows beyond the final year of the forecasts. The discount rates utilized to obtain the net present value of the reporting units' cash flows were estimated using a capital asset pricing model. Significant inputs to this model include a risk-free rate of return, beta (which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit), market equity risk premium, and, in certain cases, additional premium for size and/or unsystematic company-specific risk factors. The Company utilized discount rates that it believes adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets. The Company estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit. The Company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, so actual results may differ from forecasted results.\nAll of the preceding fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions in the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impacts the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units include such items as:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates and unexpected regulatory changes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Specific to the SC reporting unit, a decrease in SC's share price would impact the fair value of the reporting segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to the Financial Condition, Goodwill section of this MD&A for further details on the Company's goodwill, including the results of management's goodwill impairment analyses.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company uses fair value measurements to estimate the fair value of certain assets and liabilities for both measurement and disclosure purposes. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models, and significant assumptions utilized. The Company follows the fair value hierarchy set forth in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value. The Company reviews and modifies, as necessary, the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Accordingly, there may be reclassifications between hierarchy levels due to changes in inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value.\nThe Company has numerous internal controls in place to ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements, including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurements. Certain valuations are benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available.\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions from observable market data used to estimate the Company's Level 2 fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to the Company's internal valuation models used to estimate Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayment speeds, credit losses, recovery rates and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, the Company's estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current market exchange.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which includes considerable judgment. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, including investments in subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that apply or will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse or be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance will be established if the Company determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires periodic analysis of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and when the deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods. Consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of deferred tax assets. The critical assumptions used in the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance analysis are as follows: (a) the expectation of future earnings; (b) estimates of the Company's long-term annual growth rate, based on the Company's long-term economic outlook in the U.S.; (c) estimates of the dividend income payout ratio from the Company's consolidated subsidiary, SC, based on current policies and practices of SC; (d) estimates of book income to tax income differences, based on the analysis of historical differences and the historical timing of the reversal of temporary differences; (e) the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid; (f) estimates of tax credits to be earned on current investments, based on the Company's evaluation of the credits applicable to each investment; (g) experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused; (h) estimates of applicable state tax rates based on current/most recent enacted tax rates and state apportionment calculations; (i) tax planning strategies; and (j) current tax laws. Significant judgment is required to assess future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences. The Company makes certain assertions in regards to its investment in subsidiaries, which impact whether a deferred tax liability is recorded for the book over tax basis difference in the investment in these subsidiaries. This requires the Company to make judgments with respect to its ability to permanently reinvest its earnings in foreign subsidiaries and its ability to recover its investment in domestic subsidiaries in a tax free manner.\nThe Company bases its expectations of future earnings, which are used to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets, on financial performance forecasts of its operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees. The budgets and estimates used in these forecasts are approved by the Company's management, and the assumptions underlying the forecasts are reviewed at least annually and adjusted as necessary based on current developments or when new information becomes available. The updates made and the variances between the Company's forecasts and its actual performance have not been significant enough to alter the Company's conclusions with regard to the realizability of its deferred tax asset. The Company continues to forecast sufficient taxable income to fully realize its current deferred tax assets. Forecasted taxable income is subject to changes in overall market and global economic conditions.\nIn establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws in the U.S., its states and municipalities, and abroad. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending on changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. The Company reviews its tax balances quarterly and as new information becomes available. Interest and penalties on income tax payments are included within income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the related tax position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.

The average balances of investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $22.2 billion with an average yield of 2.49%, compared to an average balance of $21.3 billion with an average yield of 2.45% for the corresponding period in 2018. The increase in interest income on investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning deposits resulting from 2018 increases to the federal funds rate. During 2019, the federal funds rate was lowered three times; this has had an effect of partially offsetting increases in interest income on deposits and investments.\nInterest Income on Loans\nInterest income on loans increased $552.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to the growth of total loans. The average balance of total loans increased $6.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. This overall increase in loans was primarily driven by the continued growth of the commercial portfolio, auto loans and RICs; however, the average rate has decreased on the RIC portfolio due to more prime loan originations as a result of the SBNA origination program.\nInterest Expense on Deposits and Related Customer Accounts\nInterest expense on deposits and related customer accounts increased $185.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to overall higher interest rates and increased deposits. Higher rates were offered to customers on various deposit products in order to attract and grow the customer base. The average balance of total interest-bearing deposits was $49.8 billion with an average cost of 1.15% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to an average balance of $46.3 billion with an average cost of 0.84% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nInterest Expense on Borrowed Funds\nInterest expense on borrowed funds increased $297.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was due to higher interest rates being paid and increased balances during the year ended December 31, 2019. The average balance of total borrowings was $47.2 billion with an average cost of 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to an average balance of $40.2 billion with an average cost of 3.32% for 2018. The average balance of borrowed funds increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases in FHLB advances, credit facilities and secured structured financings.\nPROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe provision for credit losses is based on credit loss experience, growth or contraction of specific segments of the loan portfolio, and the estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for credit losses was primarily comprised of the provision for loan and lease losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 of $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>YTD Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,897,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,994,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(97,757\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(185,035\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(108,750\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76,285\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>70.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,364,673\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,974,547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(390,126\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(275\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(275\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total charge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,549,983\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,083,297\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(466,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoveries:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,321\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,954,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,572,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>381,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,008,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,632,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs, net of recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,541,773\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,450,550\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91,223\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan and lease losses (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,290,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,352,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61,961\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,646,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,897,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(250,941\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for unfunded lending commitments, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,611\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(12.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Release of reserves for unfunded lending commitments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on unfunded lending commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,859\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(716\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,143\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>578.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for unfunded lending commitments, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,674\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total ACL, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,738,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,992,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(254,615\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is the sum of the total provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's net charge-offs increased $91.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018.\nConsumer charge-offs increased $390.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nConsumer Loans Secured By Real Estate\nConsumer loans secured by real estate decreased $1.7 billion, or 11.4%, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. This decrease was comprised of a decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio of $1.0 billion, primarily due to the sale of residential mortgage loans to the FNMA in 2019, and a decrease in the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio of $695.3 million.\nConsumer Loans Not Secured By Real Estate\nRICs and auto loans\nRICs and auto loans increased $7.1 billion, or 24.3%, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. The increase in the RIC and auto loan portfolio was primarily due to an increase of purchased financial receivables from third-party lenders and originations, net of securitizations. RICs are collateralized by vehicle titles, and the lender has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the consumer defaults on the payment terms of the contract. Most of the Company's RICs held for investment are pledged against warehouse lines or securitization bonds. Refer to further discussion of these in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 66.2% (includes loans with no FICO score equivalent to 8.7% of the total portfolio) of the Company's RIC and auto loan portfolio was comprised of nonprime loans (defined by the Company as customers with a FICO score of below 640) with customers who did not qualify for conventional consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, a lack of or adverse credit history, low income levels and/or the inability to provide adequate down payments. While underwriting guidelines are designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk, nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers. Additionally, higher unemployment rates, higher gasoline prices, unstable real estate values, re-sets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies, defaults, and repossessions, as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products, weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default. Because SC's historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn.\nThe Company's automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers. The Company's robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting. Each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score using information such as FICO scores, DTI ratios, LTV ratios, and over 30 other predictive factors, placing the applicant in one of 100 pricing tiers. The pricing in each tier is continuously monitored and adjusted to reflect market and risk trends. In addition to the Company's automated process, it maintains a team of underwriters for manual review, consideration of exceptions, and review of deal structures with dealers.\nAt December 31, 2019, a typical RIC was originated with an average annual percentage rate of 16.3% and was purchased from the dealer at a premium of 0.5%. All of the Company's RICs and auto loans are fixed-rate loans.\nThe Company records an ALLL to cover its estimate of inherent losses on its RICs incurred as of the balance sheet date.\nPersonal unsecured and other consumer loans\nPersonal unsecured and other consumer loans decreased from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 by $370.8 million.\nAs a result of the strategic evaluation of SC's personal lending portfolio, in the third quarter of 2015, SC began reviewing strategic alternatives for exiting its personal loan portfolios. SC's other significant personal lending relationship is with Bluestem. SC continues to perform in accordance with the terms and operative provisions of the agreements under which it is obligated to purchase personal revolving loans originated by Bluestem for a term ending in 2020, or 2022 if extended at Bluestem's option. The Bluestem loan portfolio is carried as held-for-sale in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the Company has recorded lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments on this portfolio, and there may be further such adjustments required in future period financial statements. Management is currently evaluating alternatives for the Bluestem portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, SC's personal unsecured portfolio was held-for-sale and thus does not have a related allowance.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT\nExtending credit to customers exposes the Company to credit risk, which is the risk that contractual principal and interest due on loans will not be collected due to the inability or unwillingness of the borrower to repay the loan. The Company manages credit risk in its loan portfolio through adherence to consistent standards, guidelines, and limitations established by the Company's Board of Directors as set forth in its Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement. Written loan policies further implement these underwriting standards, lending limits, and other standards or limits deemed necessary and prudent. Various approval levels based on the amount of the loan and other key credit attributes have also been created. To ensure credit quality, loans are originated in accordance with the Company's credit and governance standards consistent with its Enterprise Risk Management Framework. Loans over certain dollar thresholds require approval by the Company's credit committees, with higher balance loans requiring approval by more senior level committees.\nThe Credit Risk Review group conducts ongoing independent reviews of the credit quality of the Company's loan portfolios and credit management processes to ensure the accuracy of the risk ratings and adherence to established policies and procedures, verify compliance with applicable laws and regulations, provide objective measurement of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, and ensure that proper documentation exists. The results of these periodic reviews are reported to business line management, Risk and the Audit Committees of both the Company and the Bank. The Company maintains a classification system for loans that identifies those requiring a higher level of monitoring by management because of one or more factors, including borrower performance, business conditions, industry trends, the liquidity and value of the collateral, economic conditions, or other factors. Loan credit quality is subject to scrutiny by business unit management, credit risk professionals, and Internal Audit.\nThe following discussion summarizes the underwriting policies and procedures for the major categories within the loan portfolio and addresses SHUSA's strategies for managing the related credit risk. Additional credit risk management related considerations are discussed further in the \"ALLL\" section of this MD&A.\nCommercial Loans\nCommercial loans principally represent commercial real estate loans (including multifamily loans), loans to C&I customers, and automotive dealer floor plan loans. Credit risk associated with commercial loans is primarily influenced by prevailing and expected economic conditions and the level of underwriting risk SHUSA is willing to assume. To manage credit risk when extending commercial credit, the Company focuses on assessing the borrower's capacity and willingness to repay and obtaining sufficient collateral. C&I loans are generally secured by the borrower's assets and by guarantees. CRE loans are originated primarily within the Mid-Atlantic, New York, and New England market areas and are secured by real estate at specified LTV ratios and often by a guarantee.\nConsumer Loans Secured by Real Estate\nCredit risk in the direct and indirect consumer loan portfolio is controlled by strict adherence to underwriting standards that consider DTI levels, the creditworthiness of the borrower, and collateral values. In the home equity loan portfolio, CLTV ratios are generally limited to 90% for both first and second liens. SHUSA originates and purchases fixed-rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that are secured by the underlying 1-4 family residential properties. Credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower, credit scores, and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative LTV ratios of generally no more than 80%. Residential mortgage loans originated or purchased in excess of an 80% LTV ratio are generally insured by private mortgage insurance, unless otherwise guaranteed or insured by the Federal, state, or local government. SHUSA also utilizes underwriting standards which comply with those of the FHLMC or the FNMA. Credit risk is further reduced, since a portion of the Company's mortgage loan production is sold to investors in the secondary market without recourse.\nConsumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate\nThe Company's consumer loans not secured by real estate include RICs acquired from manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of used and new automobiles and trucks, as well as acquired consumer marine, RV and credit card loans. Credit risk is mitigated to the extent possible through early and robust collection practices, which includes the repossession of vehicles.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCollections\nThe Company closely monitors delinquencies as another means of maintaining high asset quality. Collection efforts generally begin within 15 days after a loan payment is missed by attempting to contact all borrowers and offer a variety of loss mitigation alternatives. If these attempts fail, the Company will attempt to gain control of collateral in a timely manner in order to minimize losses. While liquidation and recovery efforts continue, officers continue to work with the borrowers, if appropriate, to recover all money owed to the Company. The Company monitors delinquency trends at 30, 60, and 90 DPD. These trends are discussed at monthly management Credit Risk Review Committee meetings and at the Company's and the Bank's Board of Directors' meetings.\nNON-PERFORMING ASSETS\nThe following table

doubts about the borrowers' ability to comply with the present repayment terms. These assets are principally loans delinquent for more than 30 days but less than 90 days. Potential problem commercial loans totaled approximately $179.9 million and $98.8 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. This increase was primarily due to loans to one large borrower within the CRE portfolio.\nPotential problem consumer loans amounted to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Management has included these loans in its evaluation of the Company's ACL and reserved for them during the respective periods.\nNon-performing assets decreased to $2.5 billion, or 1.6% of total assets, at December 31, 2019, compared to $2.6 billion, or 1.9% of total assets, at December 31, 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease in NPLs in consumer RICs.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCommercial\nCommercial NPLs decreased $91.1 million from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Commercial NPLs accounted for 0.7% and 0.9% of commercial LHFI at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease in commercial NPLs was comprised of decreases of $36.4 million in C&I and $40.9 million in the Other commercial portfolio.\nConsumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate\nRICs and amortizing personal loans are classified as non-performing when they are more than 60 DPD (i.e., 61 or more DPD) with respect to principal or interest. Except for loans accounted for using the FVO, at the time a loan is placed on non-performing status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. When an account is 60 days or less past due, it is returned to performing status and the Company returns to accruing interest on the loan. The accrual of interest on revolving personal loans continues until the loan is charged off.\nRIC TDRs are placed on non-accrual status when the account becomes past due more than 60 days. For loans in non-accrual status, interest income is recognized on a cash basis; however, the Company continues to assess the recognition of cash received on those loans in order to identify whether certain of the loans should also be placed on a cost recovery basis. For loans on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is resumed if a delinquent account subsequently becomes 60 days or less past due. However, for TDR loans placed on a cost recovery basis, the Company returns to accrual status when a sustained period of repayment performance has been achieved. NPLs in the RIC and auto loan portfolio increased by $98.1 million from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Non-performing RICs and auto loans accounted for 4.5% and 5.3% of total RICs and auto loans at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nConsumer Loans Secured by Real Estate\nThe following table shows NPLs compared to total loans outstanding for the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Residential mortgages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Home equity loans and lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Residential mortgages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Home equity loans and lines of credit\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NPLs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total LHFI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,835,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,770,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,884,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,465,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NPLs as a percentage of total LHFI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NPLs in foreclosure status\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe NPL ratio is usually higher for the Company's residential mortgage loan portfolio compared to its consumer loans secured by real estate portfolio due to a number of factors, including the prolonged workout and foreclosure resolution processes for residential mortgage loans, differences in risk profiles, and mortgage loans located outside the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. As of December 31, 2019, the consumer loans secured by real estate portfolio has a higher NPL ratio compared to the residential mortgage portfolio, primarily due to the NPL loan sale in 2019.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nDelinquencies\nThe Company generally considers an account delinquent when an obligor fails to pay substantially all (defined as 90%) of the scheduled payment by the due date.\nAt December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company's delinquencies consisted of the following:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consumer Loans Secured by Real Estate\n</td> <td>RICs and auto loans\n</td> <td>Personal Unsecured and Other Consumer Loans\n</td> <td>Commercial Loans\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consumer Loans Secured by Real Estate\n</td> <td>RICs and auto loans\n</td> <td>Personal Unsecured and Other Consumer Loans\n</td> <td>Commercial Loans\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total delinquencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$404,945\n</td> <td>$4,768,833\n</td> <td>$206,703\n</td> <td>$339,844\n</td> <td>$5,720,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$495,854\n</td> <td>$4,760,361\n</td> <td>$226,181\n</td> <td>$232,264\n</td> <td>$5,714,660\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$13,902,871\n</td> <td>$36,456,747\n</td> <td>$2,615,036\n</td> <td>$41,151,009\n</td> <td>$94,125,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$15,564,653\n</td> <td>$29,335,220\n</td> <td>$3,047,515\n</td> <td>$40,381,758\n</td> <td>$88,329,146\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delinquencies as a % of loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9%\n</td> <td>13.1%\n</td> <td>7.9%\n</td> <td>0.8%\n</td> <td>6.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2%\n</td> <td>16.2%\n</td> <td>7.4%\n</td> <td>0.6%\n</td> <td>6.5%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes LHFS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, total delinquencies increased by $5.7 million, or 0.1%, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, primarily driven by commercial loans, which increased $107.6 million, offset by consumer loans secured by real estate, which decreased $90.9 million. The increase in the commercial portfolio was due to loans to two customers that became delinquent in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by the mortgage decrease due to the NPL and FNMA sales.\nTDRs\nTDRs are loans that have been modified as the Company has agreed to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans. TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. The types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions, limitations on accrued interest charged, term extensions, and deferments of principal.\nTDRs are generally placed in nonaccrual status upon modification, unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification. For most portfolios, TDRs may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance, as long as the Company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full. RIC TDRs are placed on nonaccrual status when the Company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured, and considered for return to accrual when a sustained period of repayment performance has been achieved. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral, the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral, the loan may not be returned to accrual status.\nThe following table summarizes TDRs at the dates indicated:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

More than 90% of deferrals granted are for two months. The policies and guidelines limit the number and frequency of deferrals that may be granted to one deferral every six months and eight months over the life of a loan, while some marine and RV contracts have a maximum of twelve months in extensions to reflect their longer term. Additionally, the Company generally limits the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of payments has been received. During the deferral period, the Company continues to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement.\nAt the time a deferral is granted, all delinquent amounts may be deferred or paid, which may result in the classification of the loan as current and therefore not considered delinquent. However, there are instances when a deferral is granted but the loan is not brought completely current, such as when the account's DPD is greater than the deferment period granted. Such accounts are aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account. Historically, the majority of deferrals are approved for borrowers who are either 31-60 or 61-90 days delinquent, and these borrowers are typically reported as current after deferral. A customer is limited to one deferral each six months, and if a customer receives two or more deferrals over the life of the loan, the loan will advance to a TDR designation.\nThe Company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, the Company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio.\nChanges in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged off. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off, historical charge-off ratios, loss confirmation periods, and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the ALLL for loans classified as TDRs are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the ALLL and related provision for loan and lease losses. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the ALLL and related provision for loan and lease losses. For loans that are classified as TDRs, the Company generally compares the present value of expected cash flows to the outstanding recorded investment of TDRs to determine the amount of allowance and related provision for credit losses that should be recorded. For loans that are considered collateral-dependent, such as certain bankruptcy modifications, impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral, less its estimated costs to sell.\nACL\nThe ACL is maintained at levels management considers adequate to provide for losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. Management's evaluation takes into consideration the risks inherent in the portfolio, past loan and lease loss experience, specific loans with loss potential, geographic and industry concentrations, delinquency trends, the level of originations, credit quality metrics such as FICO scores and CLTV, internal risk ratings, economic conditions and other relevant factors. While management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations.\nItem 7.

This change in the overall ACL was primarily attributable to the decreased amount of TDRs within SC's RIC and auto loan portfolio.\nManagement regularly monitors the condition of the Company's portfolio, considering factors such as historical loss experience, trends in delinquencies and NPLs, changes in risk composition and underwriting standards, the experience and ability of staff, and regional and national economic conditions and trends.\nThe risk factors inherent in the ACL are continuously reviewed and revised by management when conditions indicate that the estimates initially applied are different from actual results. The Company also performs a comprehensive analysis of the ACL on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Company performs a review each quarter of allowance levels and trends by major portfolio against the levels of peer banking institutions to benchmark our allowance and industry norms.\nCommercial\nFor the commercial loan portfolio excluding small business loans (businesses with annual sales of up to $3 million), the Company has specialized credit officers, a monitoring unit, and workout units that identify and manage potential problem loans. Changes in management factors, financial and operating performance, company behavior, industry factors and external events and circumstances are evaluated on an ongoing basis to determine whether potential impairment is evident and/or additional analysis is needed. For the commercial loan portfolios, risk ratings are assigned to each loan to differentiate risk within the portfolio, reviewed on an ongoing basis by credit risk management and revised, if needed, to reflect the borrower's current risk profile and the related collateral position.\nThe risk ratings consider factors such as financial condition, debt capacity and coverage ratios, market presence and quality of management. Generally, credit officers reassess a borrower's risk rating on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if warranted. This reassessment process is managed by credit officers and is overseen by the credit monitoring group to ensure consistency and accuracy in risk ratings, as well as the appropriate frequency of risk rating reviews by the Company's credit officers. The Company's Credit Risk Review Committee assesses whether the Company's Credit Risk Review Framework and risk management guidelines established by the Company's Board and applicable laws and regulations are being followed, and reports key findings and relevant information to the Board. The Company's Credit Risk Review group regularly performs loan reviews and assesses the appropriateness of assigned risk ratings. When credits are downgraded below a certain level, the Company's Workout Department becomes responsible for managing the credit risk. Risk rating actions are generally reviewed formally by one or more credit committees depending on the size of the loan and the type of risk rating action being taken. Detailed analyses are completed that support the risk rating and management's strategies for the customer relationship going forward.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is identified as impaired and is collateral-dependent, an initial appraisal is obtained to provide a baseline to determine the property's fair market value. The frequency of appraisals depends on the type of collateral being appraised. If the collateral value is subject to significant volatility (due to location of the asset, obsolescence, etc.), an appraisal is obtained more frequently. At a minimum, updated appraisals for impaired loans are obtained within a 12-month period if the loan remains outstanding for that period of time.\nIf a loan is identified as impaired and is not collateral-dependent, impairment is measured based on a DCF methodology.\nThe portion of the ALLL related to the commercial portfolio was $399.8 million at December 31, 2019 (1.0% of commercial LHFI) and $441.1 million at December 31, 2018 (1.1% of commercial LHFI). The primary factor resulting in the decreased ACL allocated to the commercial portfolio was in part due to the charge-off to three large commercial borrowers.\nConsumer\nThe consumer loan and small business loan portfolios are monitored for credit risk and deterioration with statistical tools considering factors such as delinquency, LTV ratios, and internal and external credit scores. Management evaluates the consumer portfolios throughout their lifecycles on a portfolio basis. When problem loans are identified that are secured with collateral, management examines the loan files to evaluate the nature and type of collateral. Management documents the collateral type, the date of the most recent valuation, and whether any liens exist to determine the value to compare against the committed loan amount.\nResidential mortgages not adequately secured by collateral are generally charged off to fair value less cost to sell when deemed to be uncollectible or are delinquent 180 days or more, whichever comes first, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that repayment will occur regardless of the delinquency status. Examples that would demonstrate repayment likelihood include a loan that is secured by collateral and is in the process of collection, a loan supported by a valid guarantee or insurance, or a loan supported by a valid claim against a solvent estate.\nFor residential mortgage loans, loss severity assumptions are incorporated into the loan and lease loss reserve models to estimate loan balances that will ultimately charge-off. These assumptions are based on recent loss experience within various CLTV bands in these portfolios. CLTVs are refreshed quarterly by applying Federal Housing Finance Agency Home Price Index changes at a state-by-state level to the last known appraised value of the property to estimate the current CLTV. The Company's ALLL incorporates the refreshed CLTV information to update the distribution of defaulted loans by CLTV as well as the associated loss given default for each CLTV band. Reappraisals at the individual property level are not considered cost-effective or necessary on a recurring basis; however, reappraisals are performed on certain higher risk accounts to support line management activities and default servicing decisions, or when other situations arise for which the Company believes the additional expense is warranted.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nA home equity loan or line of credit not adequately secured by collateral is treated similarly to the way residential mortgages are treated. The Company incorporates home equity loan or line of credit loss severity assumptions into the loan and lease loss reserve model following the same methodology as for residential mortgage loans. To ensure the Company has captured losses inherent in its home equity portfolios, the Company estimates its ALLL for home equity loans and lines of credit by segmenting its portfolio into sub-segments based on the nature of the portfolio and certain risk characteristics such as product type, lien positions, and origination channels. Projected future defaulted loan balances are estimated within each portfolio sub-segment by incorporating risk parameters, including the current payment status as well as historical trends in delinquency rates. Other assumptions, including prepayment and attrition rates, are also calculated at the portfolio sub-segment level and incorporated into the estimation of the likely volume of defaulted loan balances. The projected default volume is stratified across CLTV ratio bands, and a loss severity rate for each CLTV band is applied based on the Company's historical net credit loss experience. This amount is then adjusted, as necessary, for qualitative considerations to reflect changes in underwriting, market, or industry conditions, or changes in trends in the composition of the portfolio, including risk composition, seasoning, and underlying collateral.\nThe Company considers the delinquency status of its senior liens in cases in which the Company services the lien. The Company currently services the senior lien on 23.5% of its junior lien home equity principal balances. Of the junior lien home equity loan and line of credit balances that are current, 1.1% have a senior lien that is one or more payments past due. When the senior lien is delinquent but the junior lien is current, allowance levels are adjusted to reflect loss estimates consistent with the delinquency status of the senior lien. The Company also extrapolates these impacts to the junior lien portfolio when the senior lien is serviced by another investor and the delinquency status of that senior lien is unknown.\nDepository and lending institutions in the U.S. generally are expected to experience a significant volume of home equity lines of credit that will be approaching the end of their draw periods over the next several years, following the growth in home equity lending experienced during 2003 through 2007. As a result, many of these home equity lines of credit will either convert to amortizing loans or have principal due as balloon payments. The Company's home equity lines of credit generated after 2007 are generally open-ended, revolving loans with fixed-rate lock options and draw periods of up to 10 years, along with amortizing repayment periods of up to 20 years. The Company currently monitors delinquency rates for amortizing and non-amortizing lines, as well as other credit quality metrics, including FICO credit scoring model scores and LTV ratios. The Company's home equity lines of credit are generally underwritten considering fully drawn and fully amortizing levels. As a result, the Company currently does not anticipate a significant deterioration in credit quality when these home equity lines of credit begin to amortize.\nFor RICs, including RICs acquired from a third-party lender that are considered to have no credit deterioration at acquisition, and personal unsecured loans at SC, the Company maintains an ALLL for the Company's HFI portfolio not classified as TDRs at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses of the recorded investment inherent in the portfolio, based on a holistic assessment, including both quantitative and qualitative considerations. For TDR loans, the allowance is comprised of impairment measured using a DCF model. RICs and personal unsecured loans are considered separately in assessing the required ALLL using product-specific allowance methodologies applied on a pooled basis.\nThe quantitative framework is supported by credit models that consider several credit quality indicators including, but not limited to, historical loss experience and current portfolio trends. The transition-based Markov model provides data on a granular and disaggregated/segment basis as it utilizes recently observed loan transition rates from various loan statuses to forecast future losses. Transition matrices in the Markov model are categorized based on account characteristics such as delinquency status, TDR type (e.g., deferment, modification, etc.), internal credit risk, origination channel, seasoning, thin/thick file and time since TDR event. The credit models utilized differ among the Company's RIC and personal loan portfolios. The credit models are adjusted by management through qualitative reserves to incorporate information reflective of the current business environment.\nThe allowance for consumer loans was $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The allowance as a percentage of HFI consumer loans was 6.2% at December 31, 2019 and 7.3% at December 31, 2018. The decrease in the allowance for consumer loans was primarily attributable to lower TDR volume and rate improvement in SC's RIC and auto loan portfolio.\nThe Company's allowance models and reserve levels are back-tested on a quarterly basis to ensure that both remain within appropriate ranges. As a result, management believes that the current ALLL is maintained at a level sufficient to absorb inherent losses in the consumer portfolios.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnallocated\nThe Company reserves for certain inherent but undetected losses that are probable within the loan and lease portfolios. This is considered to be reasonably sufficient to absorb imprecisions of models and to otherwise provide for coverage of inherent losses in the Company's entire loan and lease portfolios. These imprecisions may include loss factors inherent in the loan portfolio that may not have been discreetly contemplated in the general and specific components of the allowance, as well as potential variability in estimates. Period-to-period changes in the Company's historical unallocated ALLL positions are considered in light of these factors. The unallocated ALLL was $46.7 million and $47.0 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nReserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\nThe reserve for unfunded lending commitments decreased $3.7 million from $95.5 million at December 31, 2018 to $91.8 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease of the unfunded reserve is primarily related to the Company strategically reducing its exposure to certain business relationships and industries. The net impact of the change in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments to the overall ACL was immaterial.\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES\nInvestment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasuries, MBS, ABS and FHLB and FRB stock. MBS consist of pass-through, CMOs and adjustable rate mortgages issued by federal agencies. The Company's MBS are either guaranteed as to principal and interest by the issuer or have ratings of AAA\u201d by S&P and Moody's at the date of issuance. The Company's AFS investment strategy is to purchase liquid fixed-rate and floating-rate investments to manage the Company's liquidity position and interest rate risk adequately.\nTotal investment securities AFS increased $2.7 billion to $14.3 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $11.6 billion at December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the composition of the Company's investment portfolio changed due to an increase in U.S. Treasury securities and MBS, partially offset by a decrease in ABS. U.S. Treasuries increased by $2.3 billion primarily due to investment purchases of $3.8 billion as offset by $1.5 billion of sales. MBS increased by $739.4 million primarily due to investment purchases and a decrease in unrealized losses, partially offset by sales, maturities and principal paydowns. For additional information with respect to the Company's investment securities, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDebt securities for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity are classified as HTM securities. HTM securities are reported at cost and adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Total investment securities HTM were $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019. The Company had 99 investment securities classified as HTM as of December 31, 2019.\nTotal gross unrealized losses on investment securities AFS decreased by $258.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in unrealized losses of $246.1 million on MBS, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates.\nThe average life of the AFS investment portfolio (excluding certain ABS) at December 31, 2019 was approximately 3.86 years. The average effective duration of the investment portfolio (excluding certain ABS) at December 31, 2019 was approximately 2.85 years. The actual maturities of MBS AFS will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.\nItem 7.

Upon re-allocation, management tested the new reporting units for impairment, using the same methodology and assumptions as used in the October 1, 2018 goodwill impairment test, and noted that there was no impairment. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the change in reportable segments.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2019 using generally accepted valuation methods. The Company completes a quarterly review for impairment indicators over each of its reporting units, which includes consideration of economic and organizational factors that could impact the fair value of the Company's reporting units. At the completion of the 2019 fourth quarter review, the Company did not identify any indicators which resulted in the Company's conclusion that an interim impairment test would be required to be completed.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFor the Consumer and Business Banking reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market approach (\"market approach\") and income approach was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 25.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that were determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 1.4x was selected based on publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 9.1%, which was most representative of the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 4.0% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the Consumer and Business Banking reporting unit by 10.3%, indicating the reporting unit was not considered to be impaired.\nFor the C&I reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market and income approach was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 25.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the marketplace that were determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 1.4x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate 12.7%, which was most representative of the business' cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 4.0% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the Commercial Banking reporting unit by 18.0%, indicating the C&I reporting unit was not considered to be impaired.\nFor the CRE&VF reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market and income approach was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 25.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the marketplace that were determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 1.5x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate 9.4%, which was most representative of the business' cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 3.0% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the Commercial Banking reporting unit by 20.5%, indicating the CRE&VF reporting unit was not considered to be impaired or at risk for impairment.\nFor the CIB reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market and income approach was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 25.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that were determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 1.3x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit and was equally considered with the projected earnings multiples of 8.0x and 7.5x and 7.0x, which were\napplied to the reporting unit's 2019, 2020, and 2021 projected earnings, respectively, due to the nature of the business, which operates outside of the traditional savings and loan bank model. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 10.3%, which is most representative of the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 3.0% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the CIB reporting unit by 25.2%, indicating that the CIB reporting unit was not considered to be impaired or at risk for impairment.\nFor the SC reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, the Company used only the market capitalization approach. For the market capitalization approach, SC's stock price from October 1, 2019 of $25.53 was used and a 25.0% control premium was used based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market-place that were determined to be comparable. The results of the fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value of the SC reporting unit by 67.9%, indicating that the SC reporting unit was not considered to be impaired. Management continues to monitor SC's stock price, along with changes in the financial position and results of operations that would impact the reporting unit's carrying value on a regular basis. Through the date of this filing, there have been no indicators which would change management's assessment as of October 1, 2019.\nManagement continues to monitor changes in financial position and results of operations that would impact each of the reporting units estimated fair value or carrying value on a regular basis. Through the date of this filing, there have been no indicators which would change management's assessment as of October 1, 2019.\nDEFERRED TAXES AND OTHER TAX ACTIVITY\nThe Company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019 (consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of $503.7 million and a deferred tax liability balance of $1.5 billion), compared to a net deferred tax liability balance of $587.5 million at December 31, 2018 (consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of $625.1 million and a deferred tax liability balance of $1.2 billion). The $429.9 million increase in net deferred liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to accelerated depreciation from leasing transactions and changes in depreciation on company owned assets.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nSee further discussion of the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 7 and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A.\nFor a discussion of the status of litigation with which the Company is involved with the IRS, please refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBANK REGULATORY CAPITAL\nThe Company's capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment while maintaining appropriate capital in light of economic uncertainty and the Basel III framework.\nThe Company is subject to the regulations of certain federal, state, and foreign agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, based on the Bank's capital calculations, the Bank was considered well-capitalized under the applicable capital framework. In addition, the Company's capital levels as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, based on the Company's capital calculations, exceeded the required capital ratios for BHCs.\nFor a discussion of Basel III, which became effective for SHUSA and the Bank on January 1, 2015, including the standardized approach and related future changes to the minimum U.S. regulatory capital ratios, see the section captioned \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A.\nFederal banking laws, regulations and policies also limit the Bank's ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to the Company. The Bank must obtain prior OCC approval to declare a dividend or make any other capital distribution if, after such dividend or distribution: (1) the Bank's total distributions to SHUSA within that calendar year would exceed 100% of its net income during the year plus retained net income for the prior two years, (2) the Bank would not meet capital levels imposed by the OCC in connection with any order, or (3) the Bank is not adequately capitalized at the time. The OCC's prior approval would also be required if the Bank were notified by the OCC that it is a problem institution or in troubled condition.\nAny dividend declared and paid or return of capital has the effect of reducing capital ratios. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company paid cash dividends of $400.0 million, and $410.0 million, respectively, to its common stock shareholder and cash dividends to preferred shareholders of zero and $10.95 million, respectively. On August 15, 2018, SHUSA redeemed all of its outstanding preferred stock.\nThe following schedule summarizes the actual capital balances of SHUSA and the Bank at December 31, 2019:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHUSA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Well-capitalized Requirement(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Minimum Requirement(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CET1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As defined by Federal Reserve regulations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn February 2019, the Federal Reserve announced that the Company, as well as other less complex firms, would receive a one-year extension of the requirement to submit its results for the supervisory capital stress tests until April 5, 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced that, for the period beginning on July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, the Company would be allowed to make capital distributions up to an amount that would have allowed the Company to remain well-capitalized under the minimum capital requirements for CCAR 2018.\nIn June 2019, the Company announced its planned capital actions for the period from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. These planned capital actions are: (1) common stock dividends of $125 million per quarter from SHUSA to Santander, (2) common stock dividends paid by SC, and (3) an authorization to repurchase up to $1.1 billion of SC's outstanding common stock. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for discussion of the capital actions taken, including SC's share repurchase plans and activities.\nRefer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for discussion of the capital actions taken, including SC's share repurchase plans and activities.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverall\nThe Company continues to maintain strong liquidity. Liquidity represents the ability of the Company to obtain cost-effective funding to meet the needs of customers as well as the Company's financial obligations. Factors that impact the liquidity position of the Company include loan origination volumes, loan prepayment rates, the maturity structure of existing loans, core deposit growth levels, CD maturity structure and retention, the Company's credit ratings, investment portfolio cash flows, the maturity structure of the Company's wholesale funding, and other factors. These risks are monitored and managed centrally. The Company's Asset/Liability Committee reviews and approves the Company's liquidity policy and guidelines on a regular basis. This process includes reviewing all available wholesale liquidity sources. The Company also forecasts future liquidity needs and develops strategies to ensure adequate liquidity is available at all times. SHUSA conducts monthly liquidity stress test analyses to manage its liquidity under a variety of scenarios, all of which demonstrate that the Company has ample liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term cash requirements.\nFurther changes to the credit ratings of SHUSA, Santander and its affiliates or the Kingdom of Spain could have a material adverse effect on SHUSA's business, including its liquidity and capital resources. The credit ratings of SHUSA have changed in the past and may change in the future, which could impact its cost of and access to sources of financing and liquidity. Any reductions in the long-term or short-term credit ratings of SHUSA would increase its borrowing costs and require it to replace funding lost due to the downgrade, which may include the loss of customer deposits, limit its access to capital and money markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements. See further discussion on the impacts of credit ratings actions in the \"Economic and Business Environment\" section of this MD&A.\nSources of Liquidity\nCompany and Bank\nThe Company and the Bank have several sources of funding to meet liquidity requirements, including the Bank's core deposit base, liquid investment securities portfolio, ability to acquire large deposits, FHLB borrowings, wholesale deposit purchases, and federal funds purchased, as well as through securitizations in the ABS market and committed credit lines from third-party banks and Santander. The Company has the following major sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements: dividends and returns of investments from its subsidiaries, short-term investments held by non-bank affiliates, and access to the capital markets.\nSC\nSC requires a significant amount of liquidity to originate and acquire loans and leases and to service debt. SC funds its operations through its lending relationships with 13 third-party banks, SHUSA, and through securitizations in the ABS market and flow agreements. SC seeks to issue debt that appropriately matches the cash flows of the assets that it originates. SC has more than $7.3 billion of stockholders' equity that supports its access to the securitization markets, credit facilities, and flow agreements.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, SC completed on-balance sheet funding transactions totaling approximately $18.2 billion, including:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>securitizations on its SDART platform for approximately $3.2 billion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>securitizations on its DRIVE, deeper subprime platform, for approximately $4.5 billion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>lease securitizations on its SRT platform for approximately $3.7 billion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>lease securitization on its PSRT platform for approximately $1.2 billion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>private amortizing lease facilities for approximately $4.6 billion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>securitization on its SREV platform for approximately $0.9 billion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>issuance of retained bonds on its SDART platform for approximately $129.8 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>issuance of a retained bond on its SRT platform for approximately $60.4 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor information regarding SC's debt, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIHC\nOn June 6, 2017, SIS entered into a revolving subordinated loan agreement with SHUSA not to exceed $290.0 million for a two-year term to mature in 2019. On October 16, 2018, the revolving loan agreement was increased to $895.0 million.\nAs needed, SIS will draw down from another subordinated loan with Santander in order to enable SIS to underwrite certain large transactions in excess of the subordinated loan described above. At December 31, 2019, there was no outstanding balance on the subordinated loan.\nBSI's primary sources of liquidity are from customer deposits and deposits from affiliated banks.\nBSPR's primary sources of liquidity include core deposits, FHLB borrowings, wholesale and/or brokered deposits, and liquid investment securities.\nInstitutional borrowings\nThe Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios, and maintains contingency plans consistent with the Company's access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These include cash, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow at the FHLB and the FRB's discount window.\nAvailable Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Bank had approximately $20.3 billion in committed liquidity from the FHLB and the FRB. Of this amount, $12.4 billion was unused and therefore provides additional borrowing capacity and liquidity for the Company. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents and LHFS) and securities AFS exclusive of securities pledged as collateral) totaled approximately $15.0 billion and $15.9 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 24.3% and 25.8% of total deposits at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank, BSI and BSPR had $1.1 billion, $1.3 billion, and $838.4 million, respectively, in cash held at the FRB. Management believes that the Company has ample liquidity to fund its operations.\nBSPR has $647.6 million in committed liquidity from the FHLB, all of which was unused as of December 31, 2019, as well as $2.2 billion in liquid assets aside from cash unused as of December 31, 2019.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\nAs of January 1, 2018, the classification of restricted cash within the Company's SCF changed.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCredit Facilities\nThird-Party Revolving Credit Facilities\nWarehouse Lines\nSC uses warehouse facilities to fund its originations. Each facility specifies the required collateral characteristics, collateral concentrations, credit enhancement, and advance rates. SC's warehouse facilities generally are backed by auto RICs or auto leases. These facilities generally have one- or two-year commitments, staggered maturities and floating interest rates. SC maintains daily and long-term funding forecasts for originations, acquisitions, and other large outflows such as tax payments to balance the desire to minimize funding costs with its liquidity needs.\nSC's warehouse facilities generally have net spread, delinquency, and net loss ratio limits. Generally, these limits are calculated based on the portfolio collateralizing the respective line; however, for certain of SC's warehouse facilities, delinquency and net loss ratios are calculated with respect to its serviced portfolio as a whole. Failure to meet any of these covenants could trigger increased overcollateralization requirements or, in the case of limits calculated with respect to the specific portfolio underlying certain credit lines, result in an event of default under these agreements. If an event of default occurred under one of these agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the impacted agreement to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests against collateral pledged under the agreement, restrict SC's ability to obtain additional borrowings under the agreement, and/or remove SC as servicer. SC has never had a warehouse facility terminated due to failure to comply with any ratio or a failure to meet any covenant. A default under one of these agreements can be enforced only with respect to the impacted warehouse facility.\nSC has one credit facility with eight banks providing an aggregate commitment of $5.0 billion for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support Chrysler Finance lease financing. As of December 31, 2019, there was an outstanding balance of approximately $1.1 billion on this facility in the aggregate. The facility requires reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, or residual loss ratios, as well as other metrics exceeding specified thresholds.\nSC has seven credit facilities with eleven banks providing an aggregate commitment of $6.5 billion for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support core and Chrysler Capital loan financing. As of December 31, 2019, there was an outstanding balance of approximately $3.9 billion on these facilities in the aggregate. These facilities reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, as well as various other metrics exceeding specific thresholds.\nRepurchase Agreements\nSC also obtains financing through investment management or repurchase agreements under which it pledges retained subordinate bonds on its own securitizations as collateral for repurchase agreements with various borrowers and at renewable terms ranging up to 365 days. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, there were outstanding balances of $422.3 million and $298.9 million, respectively, under these repurchase agreements.\nSHUSA Lending to SC\nThe Company provides SC with $3.5 billion of committed revolving credit that can be drawn on an unsecured basis. The Company also provides SC with $5.7 billion of term promissory notes with maturities ranging from May 2020 to July 2024. These loans eliminate in the consolidation of SHUSA.\nSecured Structured Financings\nSC's secured structured financings primarily consist of both public, SEC-registered securitizations, as well as private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and privately issues amortizing notes. SC has on-balance sheet securitizations outstanding in the market with a cumulative ABS balance of approximately $28.0 billion.\nFlow Agreements\nIn addition to SC's credit facilities and secured structured financings, SC has a flow agreement in place with a third party for charged-off assets. Loans and leases sold under these flow agreements are not on SC's balance sheet, but provide a stable stream of servicing fee income and may also provide a gain or loss on sale. SC continues to actively seek additional flow agreements.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing\nBeginning in 2017, SC had the option to sell a contractually determined amount of eligible prime loans to Santander through securitization platforms. As all of the notes and residual interests in the securitizations are acquired by Santander, SC recorded these transactions as true sales of the RICs securitized, and removed the sold assets from its consolidated balance sheets. Beginning in 2018, this program was replaced with a new program with SBNA, whereby SC has agreed to provide SBNA with origination support services in connection with the processing, underwriting, and purchasing of retail loans, primarily from FCA dealers, all of which are serviced by SC.\nUses of Liquidity\nThe Company uses liquidity for debt service and repayment of borrowings, as well as for funding loan commitments and satisfying deposit withdrawal requests.\nSIS uses liquidity primarily to support underwriting transactions.\nThe primary use of liquidity for BSI is to meet customer liquidity requirements, such as maturing deposits, investment activities, funds transfers, and payment of its operating expenses.\nBSPR uses liquidity for funding loan commitments and satisfying deposit withdrawal requests.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company's liquidity to meet debt payments, debt service and debt maturities was in excess of 12 months.\nDividends, Contributions and Stock Issuances\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had 530,391,043 shares of common stock outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company paid dividends of $400.0 million to its sole shareholder, Santander. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company declared a cash dividend of $125.0 million on its common stock, which was paid on March 2, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, Santander made cash contributions of $88.9 million to the Company.\nSC paid a dividend of $0.20 per share in February and May 2019, and a dividend of $0.22 per share in August and November 2019. Further, SC declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share, which was paid on February 20, 2020, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 10, 2020. SC has paid a total of $291.5 million in dividends through December 31, 2019, of which $85.2 million has been paid to NCI and $206.3 million has been paid to the Company, which eliminates in the consolidated results of the Company.\nThe following table presents information regarding the shares of SC Common Stock repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2019 ($ in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$200 Million Share Repurchase Program - January 2019 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost (including commissions paid) of shares repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average price per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of shares repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>965,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$400 Million Share Repurchase Program - May 2019 through June 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost (including commissions paid) of shares repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average price per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of shares repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,749,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1.1 Billion Share Repurchase Program - July 2019 through June 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost (including commissions paid) of shares repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average price per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of shares repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,155,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) During the year ended December 31, 2018, SC purchased 9.5 million shares of SC Common Stock under its share repurchase program at a cost of approximately $182 million.\nItem 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments and other arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. See further discussion on these risks in Note 14 and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk arises primarily through the Company's traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in market interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Interest rate risk is managed by the Company's Treasury group and measured by its Market Risk Department, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Committee. In managing interest rate risk, the Company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios, while at the same time maximizing\nnet interest income and the net interest margin. To achieve these objectives, the Treasury group works closely with each business line in the Company. The Treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk, including wholesale funding maturity targeting, investment portfolio purchase strategies, asset securitizations/sales, and financial derivatives.\nInterest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates: basis risk, repricing risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes, such as differences in the extent of changes in Federal funds rates compared with the three-month LIBOR. Repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing, such as one-month versus three-month reset dates, as well as the related maturities. Yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves. Option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products. These four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations, shocks to those simulations, and scenario and market value analyses, and the subsequent results are reviewed by management. Numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses, including assumptions about new business volumes, loan and investment prepayment rates, deposit flows, interest rate curves, economic conditions and competitor pricing.\nNet Interest Income Simulation Analysis\nThe Company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk, including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense, to estimate the Company's net interest income sensitivity. This simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the Company's net interest income sensitivity. These scenarios include both parallel and non-parallel rate shocks as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four elements of risk described above. This information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the Company's risk position remains within SHUSA Board of Directors-approved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates.\nThe table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the Company's net interest income based on interest rate changes at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to\nnet interest income would result\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Down 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.07\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.31\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.87\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.56\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.58\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMVE Analysis\nThe Company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing MVE modeling. This analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the Company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet. MVE is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities. The MVE calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet, and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size, balance sheet mix, yield curve relationships or product spreads, which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement examines the effect of interest rate changes on MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk, and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates. The following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the Company's MVE at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The following estimated percentage\nincrease/(decrease) to MVE would result\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Down 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.01\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.55\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.49\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.17\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.49\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company's profile reflected a decrease of MVE of 3.01% for downward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points and an increase of 0.49% for upward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points. The asymmetrical sensitivity between up 100 and down 100 shock is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgage-related products, the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base (largely NMDs).\nIn downward parallel interest rate shocks, mortgage-related products' prepayments increase, their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited. At the same time, with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels, the Company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its NMD customers. For upward parallel interest rate shocks, extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the Company's mortgage-related products, which are predominantly long-term and fixed-rate; and for larger shocks, the loss in market value is not offset by the change in NMD.\nLimitations of Interest Rate Risk Analyses\nSince the assumptions used are inherently uncertain, the Company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or MVE. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume, characteristics of new business, behavior of existing positions, and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors.\nUses of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks\nTo mitigate interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange, equity and credit risks, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows.\nThrough the Company's capital markets and mortgage banking activities, it is subject to price risk. The Company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios. In addition, SHUSA's Board of Directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities. The level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements, and will vary from period to period.\nManagement uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities, assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments. The nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments.\nThe Company's derivatives portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments, forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps. As part of its overall business strategy, the Bank originates residential mortgages. It sells a portion of this production to the FHLMC, the FNMA, and private investors. The Company uses forward sales as a means of hedging against the economic impact of changes in interest rates on the mortgages that are originated for sale and on interest rate lock commitments.\nThe Company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold. The majority of the Company's residential MSRs are accounted for at fair value. As deemed appropriate, the Company economically hedges MSRs, using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase MBS. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate.\nThe Company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales and equity options, which manage its market risk associated with certain customer deposit products.\nFor additional information on foreign exchange contracts, derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBORROWINGS AND OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company has term loans and lines of credit with Santander and other lenders. The Bank utilizes borrowings and other debt obligations as a source of funds for its asset growth and asset/liability management. The Bank also utilizes repurchase agreements, which are short-term obligations collateralized by securities. In addition, SC has warehouse lines of credit and securitizes some of its RICs and operating leases, which are structured secured financings. Total borrowings and other debt obligations at December 31, 2019 were $50.7 billion, compared to $45.0 billion at December 31, 2018.

These limitations should be compensated for by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using this non-GAAP information only as a supplement to evaluate the Company's performance.\nThe Company considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Company believes that there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess the Company's capital adequacy using these ratios, the Company believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures may allow readers to compare certain aspects of the Company's capitalization to other organizations. However, because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios, the Company's calculations may not be directly comparable with those of other organizations, and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nItem 7.

SHUSA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and the Bank's main office is in Wilmington, Delaware. SC is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Santander. SHUSA is also the parent company of Santander BanCorp , a holding company headquartered in Puerto Rico that offers a full range of financial services through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, BSPR; SSLLC, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in Boston; BSI, a financial services company headquartered in Miami that offers a full range of banking services to foreign individuals and corporations based primarily in Latin America; SIS, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in New York providing services in investment banking, institutional sales, trading and offering research reports of Latin American and European equity and fixed-income securities; and several other subsidiaries. SSLLC, SIS and another SHUSA subsidiary, Santander Asset Management, LLC, are registered investment advisers with the SEC.\nThe Bank's principal markets are in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. The Bank uses its deposits, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios. The Bank earns interest income on its loan and investment portfolios. In addition, the Bank generates non-interest income from a number of sources, including deposit and loan services, sales of loans and investment securities, capital markets products and BOLI. The principal non-interest expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and facility-related costs, technology and other administrative expenses. The financial results of the Bank are affected by the economic environment, including interest rates and consumer and business confidence and spending, as well as the competitive conditions within the Bank's geographic footprint.\nSC is a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing. SC's primary business is the indirect origination and securitization of RICs, principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to subprime retail consumers. Further information about SC's business is provided below in the Chrysler Capital\u201d section.\nSC is managed through a single reporting segment which included vehicle financial products and services, including RICs, vehicle leases, and dealer loans, as well as financial products and services related to recreational and marine vehicles and other consumer finance products.\nSC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, SC has other relationships through which it holds other consumer finance products. However, in 2015, SC announced its exit from personal lending and, accordingly, all of its personal lending assets are classified as HFS at December 31, 2019.\nChrysler Capital\nSince May 2013, under the ten-year private label financing agreement with FCA that became effective May 1, 2013 (the \"Chrysler Agreement\"), SC has operated as FCA's preferred provider for consumer loans, leases and dealer loans and provides services to FCA customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand. These products and services include consumer RICs and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit.\nChrysler Capital continues to be a focal point of the Company's strategy. On June 28, 2019, SC entered into an amendment to the Chrysler Agreement with FCA, which modified the Chrysler Agreement to, among other things, adjust certain performance metrics, exclusivity commitments and payment provisions under the Chrysler Agreement. The amendment also established an operating framework that is mutually beneficial for both parties for the remainder of the contract. The Company's average penetration rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 34%, an increase from 30% for the same period in 2018.\nSC has dedicated financing facilities in place for its Chrysler Capital business and has worked strategically and collaboratively with FCA to continue to strengthen its relationship and create value within the Chrysler Capital program. During the year ended December 31, 2019, SC originated $12.8 billion in Chrysler Capital loans, which represented 56% of the UPB of its total RIC originations, with an approximately even share between prime and non-prime, as well as $8.5 billion in Chrysler Capital leases. Additionally, substantially all of the leases originated by SC during the year ended December 31, 2019 were under the Chrysler Agreement. Since its May 2013 launch, Chrysler Capital has originated more than $65.9 billion in retail loans (excluding the SBNA RIC origination program) and purchased $41.9 billion in leases.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nOverview\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, unemployment remained low and year-to-date market results were positive, recovering from a volatile fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe unemployment rate at December 31, 2019 was 3.5% compared to 3.5% at September 30, 2019, and was lower compared to 3.9% one year ago. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment rose in the retail trade, and healthcare, while mining employment decreased.\nThe BEA advance estimate indicates that real gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.1% for the fourth quarter of 2019, consistent with the advance estimated growth of 2.1% for the third quarter of 2019. Growth continued to be driven by increases in personal consumption expenditures, federal government spending, and state and local government spending. In addition, imports, which are a subtraction to in the calculation of the gross domestic product, decreased. These positive contributions were offset by decreases to private inventory investment and non-residential fixed investments.\nMarket year-to-date returns for the following indices based on closing prices at December 31, 2019 were:\n\nAt its December 2019 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the federal funds rate target at 1.50%, to continue to support economic expansion, current strength in labor market conditions, and inflation near its targeted objective. Overall inflation remains below the targeted rate of 2.0%.\nThe ten-year Treasury bond rate at December 31, 2019 was 1.90%, down from 2.69% at December 31, 2018. Within the industry, changes in this metric are often considered to correspond to changes in 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates.\nCurrent mortgage origination and refinancing information is not yet available. Based on the most current information released based on September 2019 statistics, mortgage originations increased 29.74% year-over-year, which included an increased 6.21% in mortgage originations for home purchases and an increased 103.1% in mortgage originations from refinancing activity from the same period in 2018. These rates are representative of U.S. national average mortgage origination activity.\nThe ratio of NPLs to total gross loans for U.S. banks declined for six consecutive years, to just under 1.5% in 2015. NPL trends have remained relatively low since that time. NPLs for U.S. commercial banks were approximately 0.87% of loans using the latest available data, which was as of the third quarter of 2019, compared to 0.95% for the prior year.\nChanging market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the Company. The interest rate environment can present challenges in the growth of net interest income for the banking industry, which continues to rely on non-interest activities to support revenue growth. Changing market conditions and political uncertainty could have an overall impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Such conditions could also impact the Company's credit risk and the associated provision for credit losses and legal expense.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCredit Rating Actions\nThe following table presents Moody's, S&P and Fitch credit ratings for the Bank, BSPR, SHUSA, Santander, and the Kingdom of Spain, as of December 31, 2019:\n\n\n(1) P-1 Short Term Deposit Rating; P-2 Short Term Debt Rating.\n(2) Outlook currently is Stable and under review with the possibility of a downgrade.\nMoody's announced completion of its periodic reviews and affirmed its ratings over SHUSA, SBNA and BSPR in March 2019. Spain in August 2019 and Santander in June 2019. Fitch affirmed its ratings and outlook for Spain in December 2019 and BSPR in October 2019.\nSHUSA funds its operations independently of the other entities owned by Santander, and believes its business is not necessarily closely related to the business or outlook of other entities owned by Santander. Future changes in the credit ratings of its parent, Santander, or the Kingdom of Spain, however, could impact SHUSA's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and any other change in the condition of Santander could affect SHUSA.\nAt this time, SC is not rated by the major credit rating agencies.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nThe activities of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank and SC, are subject to regulation under various U.S. federal laws and regulatory agencies which impose regulations, supervise and conduct examinations, and may affect the operations and management of the Company and its ability to take certain actions, including making distributions to our parent. The Company is regulated on a consolidated basis by the Federal Reserve, including the FRB of Boston, and the CFPB. The Company's banking and bank holding company subsidiaries are further supervised by the FDIC and the OCC. As a subsidiary of the Company, SC is also subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve as well as the CFPB. Santander BanCorp and BSPR also are supervised by the Puerto Rico Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions.\nPayment of Dividends\nSHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA and other consolidated subsidiaries, and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. SHUSA and SBNA are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain \"well-capitalized\" under prompt corrective action regulations. As a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, SC is included in various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends as described in the Stress Tests and Capital Adequacy\u201d discussion in this section. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A for detail of the capital actions of the Company and its subsidiaries during the period.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFBOs\nIn February 2014, the Federal Reserve issued the final rule implementing certain EPS mandated by the DFA. Under the Final Rule, FBOs with over $50 billion of U.S. non-branch assets, including Santander, were required to consolidate U.S. subsidiary activities under an IHC. In addition, the Final Rule required U.S. BHCs and FBOs with at least $50 billion in total U.S. consolidated non-branch assets to be subject to EPS and heightened capital, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements. Due to both its global and U.S. non-branch total consolidated asset size, Santander was subject to both of the above provisions of the Final Rule. As a result of this rule, Santander has transferred substantially all of its U.S. bank and non-bank subsidiaries previously outside the Company to the Company, which became an IHC effective July 1, 2016.\nEconomic Growth Act\nIn May 2018, the Economic Growth Act was signed into law. The Economic Growth Act scales back certain requirements of the DFA. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized a rulemaking implementing the changes required by the Economic Growth Act. The rulemaking provides a tailored approach to the EPS mandated by Section 165 of the DFA. Under the new tailored approach, banks are placed into different categories based on asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. The tailoring rule applies to both Santander and the Company. Both Santander and the Company were placed into Category four of the tailoring rule. The new tailored standards are discussed further below.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nU.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules are applicable to both SHUSA and the Bank and establish a comprehensive capital framework that includes both the advanced approaches for the largest internationally active U.S. banks, formerly known as Basel II, and a standardized approach that applies to all banking organizations with over $500 million in assets.\nThese rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and prompt corrective action thresholds that, when fully phased in, require banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter, of 4.0%. A further capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these minimum ratios was phased in effective January 1, 2019. This buffer is required for banking institutions and BHCs to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends.\nThese U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules include deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that MSRs, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities are deducted from CET1 to the extent any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 for the Company and the Bank began on January 1, 2015 and was initially planned over three years, with a fully phased-in requirement of January 1, 2018. However, during 2017, the regulatory agencies finalized changes to the capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2018. These changes extended the current treatment and deferred the final transition provision phase-in at non-advanced approach institutions for certain capital elements, and suspended the risk-weight to 100 percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital, in lieu of advancing to 250 percent. During 2019, the regulatory agencies approved a final rule which includes simplifications for non-advanced approaches to the generally applicable capital rules, specifically with regard to the treatment of minority interest, as well as modifying the risk-weight to 250 percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital. This final rule will become effective on April 1, 2020.\nSee the Bank Regulatory Capital section of this MD&A for the Company's capital ratios under Basel III standards. The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Company's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIf capital has reached the significantly or critically undercapitalized levels, further material restrictions can be imposed, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and, in critically undercapitalized situations, appointment of a receiver or conservator. Critically undercapitalized institutions generally may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt. All but well-capitalized institutions are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act and OCC regulations, institutions which are not categorized as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are restricted from making capital distributions, which include cash dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution. At December 31, 2019, the Bank met the criteria to be classified as well-capitalized.\u201d\nOn April 10, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a NPR seeking comment on a proposal to simplify capital rules for large banks. If finalized as proposed, the NPR would replace the capital conservation buffer. The capital conservation buffer would be replaced with a new SCB. The SCB is calculated as the maximum decline in CET1 in the severely adverse scenario (subject to a 2.5% floor) plus four quarters of dividends. The proposal would result in new regulatory capital minimums which are equal to 4.5% CET1 plus the SCB, any GSIB surcharge, and any countercyclical capital buffer. The GSIB buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to SHUSA. These new minimums would be firm-specific and would trigger restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses in the event a firm falls below their new minimums. Firms would still submit a capital plan annually. Supervisory expectations for capital planning processes would not change under the proposal. The Company does not expect this NPR, if finalized as proposed, to have a material impact on its current or future planned capital actions. This rule was finalized on March 4, 2020, and its impact is being evaluated.\nStress Testing and Capital Planning\nThe DFA also requires certain banks and BHCs, including the Company, to perform a stress test and submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve and receive a notice of non-objection before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. In June 2018, the Company announced that the Federal Reserve did not object to the planned capital actions described in the Company's capital plan through June 30, 2019. In February 2019, the Federal Reserve announced that SHUSA, as well as other less complex firms, would receive a one-year extension of the requirement to submit its capital plan until April 5, 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced that, for the period beginning July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, the Company would be allowed to make capital distributions up to the amount that would have allowed it to remain above all minimum capital requirements in CCAR 2018, adjusted for any changes in the Company's regulatory capital ratios since the Federal Reserve acted on the 2018 capital plan.\nIn October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that tailor the stress testing and capital actions a company is required to perform based on the company's asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. Under the tailoring rules, the Company is required to submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis. The Company is also subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle. The Company continues to evaluate planned capital actions in its annual capital plan and on an ongoing basis.\nLiquidity Rules\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC have established a rule to implement the Basel III LCR for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies, and a modified version of the LCR for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active. The LCR is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. Smaller covered companies (more than $50 billion in assets) such as the Company were required to calculate the LCR monthly beginning January 2016.\nIn October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that tailor the liquidity requirements based on a company's asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. In light of the fact that the Company is under $250 billion in assets and has less than $50 billion in short-term wholesale funding, the Company is no longer required to disclose the US LCR.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe NSFR is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon The NSFR requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on- and off-balance sheet activities, thereby reducing the likelihood that disruptions to a bank's regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity in a way that could increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress. In May 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule for NSFR applicable to U.S. financial institutions. The proposed rule has not been finalized, and the Company is currently evaluating the impact the proposed rule would have on its financial position, results of operations and disclosures.\nResolution Planning\nThe DFA requires all BHCs and FBOs with assets of $50 billion or more to prepare and regularly update resolution plans. The 165(d) Resolution Plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and that no extraordinary support\u201d is received from the U.S. or any other government. The most recent 165(d) Resolution Plan was submitted to the Federal Reserve and FDIC in December 2018. In addition, under amended Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act rules, the IDI resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of $50 billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors' rapid access to their insured deposits, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution. The most recent IDI resolution plan was submitted to the FDIC in June 2018. SHUSA and SBNA are currently awaiting feedback.\nTLAC\nThe TLAC Rule requires certain U.S. organizations to maintain a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments, including a minimum amount of unsecured LTD. The TLAC Rule applies to U.S. GSIBs and to IHCs with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important FBO. The Company is such an IHC.\nUnder the TLAC Rule, companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC, which consists of a minimum amount of LTD and Tier 1 capital. As a result, SHUSA must hold the higher of 18% of its RWAs or 9% of its total consolidated assets in the form of TLAC, of which 6% of its RWAs or 3.5% of total consolidated assets must consist of LTD. In addition, SHUSA must maintain a TLAC buffer composed solely of CET1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the TLAC buffer it maintains. The TLAC Rule became effective on January 1, 2019.\nVolcker Rule\nThe DFA added new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act, which is commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule.\u201d The Volcker Rule prohibits a banking entity\u201d from engaging in proprietary trading\u201d or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a Covered Fund: (i) acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in the Covered Fund; (ii) controlling the Covered Fund; or (iii) engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the Covered Fund. These prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities.\nBecause the term banking entity\u201d includes an IDI, a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates, the Volcker Rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as Santander, the Company, and certain of the Company's subsidiaries (including the Bank and SC), as well as other Santander subsidiaries in the United States and abroad.\nThe Company implemented certain policies and procedures, training programs, recordkeeping, internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the Volcker Rule. As required by the Volcker Rule, the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and Covered Fund activities. SHUSA's compliance program includes, among other things, processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the Volcker Rule, testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule.\nIn October 2019, the joint agencies responsible for administering the Volcker Rule finalized revisions to Volcker Rule. The final rule tailors the Volcker Rule's compliance requirements to the amount of a firm's trading activity, revise the definition of a trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and simplify the information companies are required to provide the banking agencies. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this final rule.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRisk Retention Rule\nIn December 2014, the Federal Reserve issued its final credit risk retention rule, which generally requires sponsors of ABS to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing ABS. SHUSA, primarily through SC, is an active participant in the structured finance markets and began to comply with the retention requirements effective in December 2016.\nMarket Risk Rule\nThe market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold risk-based regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions. The bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internal-risk based models. The market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the bank's internal risk based models, as well as qualitative requirements for the bank's management of market risk. Banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions.\nA bank is subject to the market risk capital rules if its consolidated trading activity, defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, equals the lesser of: (1) 10 percent or more of the bank's total assets as reported in its Call Report and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, or (2) $1 billion or more. At September 30, 2019, SBNA reported aggregate trading exposure in excess of the market risk threshold, and as a result, both the Company and SBNA began holding the market risk component within RWA of the risk-based capital ratios, and submitted the FFIEC 102 - Market Risk Regulatory Report beginning for the period ended December 31, 2019. The incorporation of market risk within regulatory capital has resulted in a decrease in the risk-based capital ratios.\nCapital Simplification Rule\nThe federal banking agencies are adopting a final rule that simplifies for non-advanced approaches banking organizations the generally applicable capital rules and makes a number of technical corrections. Specifically, it reverses the previous transition provision freeze on MSRs and deferred tax assets by modifying the risk-weight from 100% to 250%. The rule will also replace the existing methodology for calculating includible minority interest with a flat 10% limit at each capital level. The increased risk weighting presents an unfavorable decline to the Company's risk-based ratios, but it is estimated that the Tier 1 and total capital ratios will improve overall due to the additional minority interest includible under the simplified rule. The capital simplification rule becomes effective April 1, 2020; however, regulators have granted the option for institutions to adopt early on January 1, 2020. The Company plans to adopt this new rule on April 1, 2020.\nHeightened Standards\nOCC guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions are commonly referred to as heightened standards.\u201d The heightened standards apply to insured national banks with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. The heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions' boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework.\nTransactions with Affiliates\nDepository institutions must remain in compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve's Regulation W, which governs transactions of the Company and its banking subsidiaries with affiliated companies and individuals. Section 23A imposes limits on certain specified covered transactions,\u201d which include loans, lines, and letters of credit to affiliated companies or individuals, and investments in affiliated companies, as well as certain other transactions with affiliated companies and individuals. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to 10% of a bank's capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20% for all affiliates. Certain covered transactions also must meet collateral requirements that range from 100% to 130% depending on the type of transaction.\nSection 23B of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits a depository institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are considered arms'-length. To meet the definition of arm's-length, the terms of the transaction must be the same, or at least as favorable, as those for similar transactions with non-affiliated companies. As a U.S. domiciled subsidiary of a global parent with significant non-bank affiliates, the Company faces elevated compliance risk in this area.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRegulation AB II\nRegulation AB II, among other things, expanded disclosure requirements and modified the offering and shelf registration process for ABS. SC must comply with these rules, which impact all offerings of publicly registered ABS and all reports under the Exchange Act, for outstanding publicly-registered ABS, and affect SC's public securitization platform.\nCRA\nSBNA and BSPR are subject to the requirements of the CRA, which requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which it is located. BSPR's current CRA rating is Outstanding\u201d and SBNA's current CRA rating is \"Satisfactory.\" The OCC takes into account the Bank's CRA rating in considering certain regulatory applications the Bank makes, including applications related to establishing and relocating branches, and the Federal Reserve does the same with respect to certain regulatory applications the Company makes.\nOn December 12, 2019, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued the CRA NPR to modernize the regulatory framework implementing the CRA. The CRA NPR generally focuses on clarifying and expanding the activities that qualify for CRA consideration, providing benchmarks to determine what levels of activity are necessary to obtain a particular CRA rating, establishing additional assessment areas based on the location of a bank's deposits, and increasing clarity and consistency in reporting. The CRA NPR contemplates that regulators will provide a publicly available, non-exhaustive list of activities that would automatically receive CRA consideration. In addition, the CRA NPR allows banks to receive consideration for certain qualifying activities conducted outside their assessment areas. It currently is unclear when and in what manner the OCC and FDIC will finalize the CRA NPR.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nOn February 25, 2015, SC entered into a consent order with the DOJ, approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, which resolved the DOJ's claims against SC that certain of its repossession and collection activities during the period of time between January 2008 and February 2013 violated the SCRA. The consent order required SC to pay a civil fine in the amount of $55,000, as well as at least $9.4 million to affected service members, consisting of $10,000 per service member plus compensation for any lost equity (with interest) for each repossession by SC and $5,000 per service member for each instance where SC sought to collect repossession-related fees on accounts for which a repossession was conducted by a prior account-holder. The consent order required SC to undertake additional remedial measures. The consent order also subjected SC to monitoring by the DOJ for compliance with the SCRA for a period of five years. The consent order terminated as of February 26, 2019.\nOn March 21, 2017, SC and the Company entered into a written agreement with the FRB of Boston. Under the terms of that agreement, SC is required to enhance its compliance risk management program, board oversight of risk management and senior management oversight of risk management, and the Company is required to enhance its oversight of SC's management and operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, SSLLC had received 751 FINRA arbitration cases related to Puerto Rico bonds and Puerto Rico CEFs that SSLLC previously recommended and/or sold to clients. Most of these cases are based upon concerns regarding the local Puerto Rico securities market. The statements of claims allege, among other things, fraud, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, unsuitability, over-concentration and failure to supervise. There were 439 arbitration cases pending as of December 31, 2019. The Company has experienced a decrease in the volume of claims since September 30, 2019; however, it is reasonably possible that it could experience an increase in claims in future periods.\nOn August 8, 2019, bond insurers National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation and MBIA Insurance Corporation filed suit in Puerto Rico state court against eight Puerto Rico municipal bond underwriters, including SSLLC, alleging that the underwriters made misrepresentations in connection with the issuance of the debt and that the bond insurers relied on such misrepresentations in agreeing to insure certain of the bonds. The complaint alleges damages of not less than $720 million. The defendants removed the case to federal court, and plaintiffs have sought to return the case to state court.\nIn addition, SSLLC, Santander BanCorp, BSPR, the Company and Santander are defendants in a putative class action alleging federal securities and common law claims relating to the solicitation and purchase of more than $180 million of Puerto Rico bonds and $101 million of CEFs during the period from December 2012 to October 2013. The case is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and is captioned Jorge Ponsa-Rabell, et. al. v. SSLLC, Civ. No. 3:17-cv-02243. The amended complaint alleges that defendants acted in concert to defraud purchasers in connection with the underwriting and sale of Puerto Rico municipal bonds, CEFs and open-end funds. In May 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act\nPursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law.\nThe following activities are disclosed in response to Section 13(r) with respect to affiliates of SHUSA within the Santander Group. During the period covered by this annual report:\n \u2022 Santander UK holds accounts for two customers, with the first customer holding one savings account and one current account and the second customer holding one savings account. Both of the customers, who are resident in the UK, are currently designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program. Revenues and profits generated by Santander UK on these accounts in the year ended December 31, 2019 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Santander. \n \u2022 During the period covered by this annual report, Santander UK held one savings account with a balance of \u00a31.24, and one current account with a balance of \u00a31,884.53, for another customer resident in the UK who is currently designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program. The customer relationship pre-dates the designations of the customer under these sanctions. The United Nations and European Union removed this customer from their equivalent sanctions lists in 2008. Santander UK determined to put a block on these accounts, and the accounts were subsequently closed on 14 January 2019. Revenues and profits generated by Santander UK on these accounts in the year ended December 31, 2019 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Santander. \n \u2022 Santander UK holds two frozen current accounts for two UK nationals who are designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program. The accounts held by each customer have been frozen since their designation and remained frozen through the year ended December 31, 2019. The accounts are in arrears (\u00a31,844.73 in debit combined) and are currently being managed by Santander UK's Collections and Recoveries Department. No revenues or profits were generated by Santander UK on these accounts in the year ended December 31, 2019. \n \u2022 The Santander Group also has certain legacy performance guarantees for the benefit of Bank Sepah and Bank Mellat (stand-by letters of credit to guarantee the obligations - either under tender documents or under contracting agreements - of contractors who participated in public bids in Iran) that were in place prior to April 27, 2007. \n \u2022 During the period covered by this annual report, Santander Brasil held one current account with a balance of R$100.00 for a customer resident in Brazil who is currently designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program. The customer relationship pre-dates the designation of the customer under these sanctions. Santander Brasil determined to terminate the account even prior to the customer being formally designated under the SDGT sanctions program on September 10, 2019, and the account was subsequently closed on October 9, 2019. Revenues and profits generated by Santander Brasil on this account in the year ended December 31, 2019 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Santander. \nIn the aggregate, all of the transactions described above resulted in gross revenues and net profits in the year ended December 31, 2019 which were negligible relative to the overall revenues and profits of Santander. Santander has undertaken significant steps to withdraw from the Iranian market, such as closing its representative office in Iran and ceasing all banking activities therein, including correspondent relationships, deposit-taking from Iranian entities and issuing export letters of credit, except for the legacy transactions described above. Santander is not contractually permitted to cancel these arrangements without either (i) paying the guaranteed amount (in the case of the performance guarantees), or (ii) forfeiting the outstanding amounts due to it (in the case of the export credits). As such, Santander intends to continue to provide the guarantees and hold these assets in accordance with company policy and applicable laws.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThis MD&A is based on the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, accordingly, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. However, the Company is not currently aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results. Management identified accounting for ALLL and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, estimates of expected residual values of leased vehicles subject to operating leases, accretion of discounts and subvention on RICs, goodwill, fair value measurements and income taxes as the Company's most critical accounting estimates, in that they are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nALLL for Loan Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\nThe ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments represent management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of SHUSA's ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is regularly evaluated. This evaluation process is subject to several estimates and applications of judgment. Management's evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb loan and lease losses takes into consideration the risks in the loan portfolio, past loan and lease loss experience, specific loans that have loss potential, geographic and industry concentrations, delinquency trends, economic conditions, the level of originations and other relevant factors. Management also considers loan quality, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, the amount of NPLs, and industry trends. Changes in these estimates could have a direct material impact on the provision for credit losses recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and/or could result in a change in the recorded allowance and reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The loan portfolio represents the largest asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the methodology used to determine the ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the periods presented is included in the Credit Risk Management section of this MD&A.\nThe ALLL includes: (i) an allocated allowance, which is comprised of allowances established on loans specifically evaluated for impairment and loans collectively evaluated for impairment, based on historical loan and lease loss experience adjusted for current trends general economic conditions and other risk factors, and (ii) an unallocated allowance to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process. Generally, the Company's loans held for investment are carried at amortized cost, net of the ALLL. The ALLL includes the estimate of credit losses to be realized during the loss emergence period based on the recorded investment in the loan, including net discounts that are expected at the time of charge-off. In the case of loans purchased in a bulk purchase or business combination, the entire discount on the loan portfolio is considered as available to absorb the credit losses when determining the ALLL. For these loans, the Company records provisions for credit losses when incurred losses exceed the unaccreted purchase discount. Reserve levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly.\nThe Company's allocated reserves are principally based on various models subject to the Company's Model Risk Management Framework. New models are approved by the Company's Model Risk Management Committee. Models, inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually, and the Company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Committee.\nThe Company's unallocated allowance is no more than 5% of the overall allowance. This is considered to be reasonably sufficient to absorb imprecisions of models to otherwise provide for coverage of inherent losses in the Company's entire loan and lease portfolio. Imprecisions include loss factors in the loan portfolio that may not have been discreetly contemplated in the general and specific components of the allowance, as well as potential variability in estimates. Period-to-period changes in the Company's historical unallocated ALLL positions are considered in light of these factors.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nValuation of Automotive Lease Assets and Residuals\nThe Company has significant investments in vehicles in SC's operating lease portfolio. In accounting for operating leases, management must make a determination at the beginning of the lease contract of the estimated realizable value (i.e., residual value) of the vehicle at the end of the lease. Residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to four years. At contract inception, the Company determines the projected residual value based on an internal evaluation of the expected future value. This evaluation is based on a proprietary model using internally-generated data that is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness. The customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a finance charge. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, the Company is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception. Management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of leased vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of leased assets.\nTo account for residual risk, the Company depreciates automobile operating lease assets to estimated realizable value on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The estimated realizable value is initially based on the residual value established at contract inception. Periodically, the Company revises the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and other relevant data points, and adjusts depreciation expense appropriately over the remaining term of the lease.\nThe Company periodically evaluates its investment in operating leases for impairment if circumstances, such as a systemic and material decline in used vehicle values occurs. These circumstances could include, for example, a decline in the residual value of our lease portfolio due to an event caused by shocks to oil and gas prices (which may have a pronounced impact on certain models of vehicles) or pervasive manufacturer defects (which may systemically affect the value of a particular brand or model). Impairment is determined to exist if the fair value of the leased asset is less than its carrying value and it is determined that the net carrying value is not recoverable. The net carrying value of a leased asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon eventual disposition. If our operating lease assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value as estimated by DCF. No such impairment was recognized in 2019, 2018, or 2017.\nThe Company's depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers management's expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination, which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values. The critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automobile lease assets include: (1) estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values, (2) proper identification and estimation of business conditions, (3) our remarketing abilities, and (4) automobile manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the value of the lease residuals. Expected residual values include estimates of payments from automobile manufacturers\nrelated to residual support and risk-sharing agreements, if any. To the extent an automotive manufacturer is not able to fully honor its obligation relative to these agreements, the Company's depreciation expense would be negatively impacted.\nAccretion of Discounts and Subvention on RICs\nLHFI include the RIC portfolio which consists largely of nonprime automobile loans, and which are primarily acquired individually from dealers at a nonrefundable discount from the contractual principal amount. The Company also pays dealer participation on certain receivables. The amortization of discounts, subvention payments from manufacturers, and other origination costs are recognized as adjustments to the yield of the related contracts. The Company applies significant assumptions, including prepayment speeds, in estimating the accretion rates used to approximate effective yield.\nThe Company estimates future principal prepayments specific to pools of homogeneous loans which are based on the vintage, credit quality at origination and term of the loan. Prepayments in our portfolio are sensitive to credit quality, with higher credit quality loans experiencing higher voluntary prepayment rates than lower credit quality loans. The impact of defaults is not considered in the prepayment rate; the prepayment rate only considers voluntary prepayments. The resulting prepayment rate specific to each pool is based on historical experience and is used as an input in the calculation of the constant effective yield.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGoodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the Company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities represents goodwill. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized on a recurring basis, but rather are subject to periodic impairment testing.\nAs more fully described in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. The Company conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 1, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. As of December 31, 2019, the reporting units with assigned goodwill were Consumer and Business Banking, C&I, CRE & VF, CIB, and SC.\nAn entity's quantitative goodwill impairment analysis must be completed unless the entity determines, based on certain qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, including goodwill, and that no impairment exists. An entity has an unconditional option to bypass the preceding qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test.\nThe quantitative analysis requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including its allocated goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value, impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. A recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit, and cannot subsequently be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers. The Company utilizes the market capitalization approach to determine the fair value of its SC reporting unit, as it is a publicly traded company that has a single reporting unit. Determining the fair value of the remaining reporting units requires significant valuation inputs, assumptions, and estimates.\nThe Company determines the carrying value of each reporting unit using a risk-based capital approach. Certain of the Company's assets are assigned to a Corporate/Other category. These assets are related to the Company's corporate-only programs, such as BOLI, and are not employed in or related to the operations of a reporting unit or considered in determining the fair value of a reporting unit.\nGoodwill impairment testing involves management's judgment, requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value. This is performed using widely-accepted valuation techniques, such as the guideline public company market approach (earnings and price-to-tangible book value multiples of comparable public companies), the market capitalization approach (share price of the reporting unit and control premium of comparable public companies), and the income approach (the DCF method). The Company uses a combination of these accepted methodologies to determine the fair valuation of reporting units. Several factors are taken into account, including actual operating results, future business plans, economic projections, and market data.\nThe guideline public company market approach (\"market approach\") includes earnings and price-to-tangible book value multiples of comparable public companies which were applied to the earnings and equity for all of the Company's reporting units. The market capitalization plus control premium approach was applied to the Company's SC reporting unit, as the SC reporting unit is a publicly traded subsidiary whose securities are traded in an active market.\nIn connection with the market capitalization plus control premium approach applied to the Company's SC reporting unit, the Company used SC's stock price as of the date of the annual impairment analysis. The Company also considered historical auto loan industry transactions and control premiums over the last three years in determining the control premium.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe DCF method of the income approach incorporates the reporting units' forecasted cash flows, including a terminal value to estimate the fair value of cash flows beyond the final year of the forecasts. The discount rates utilized to obtain the net present value of the reporting units' cash flows were estimated using a capital asset pricing model. Significant inputs to this model include a risk-free rate of return, beta (which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit), market equity risk premium, and, in certain cases, additional premium for size and/or unsystematic company-specific risk factors. The Company utilized discount rates that it believes adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets. The Company estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit. The Company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, so actual results may differ from forecasted results.\nAll of the preceding fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions in the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impacts the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units include such items as:\n \u2022 a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate; \n \u2022 an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree; \n \u2022 volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates and unexpected regulatory changes; \n \u2022 Specific to the SC reporting unit, a decrease in SC's share price would impact the fair value of the reporting segment. \nRefer to the Financial Condition, Goodwill section of this MD&A for further details on the Company's goodwill, including the results of management's goodwill impairment analyses.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company uses fair value measurements to estimate the fair value of certain assets and liabilities for both measurement and disclosure purposes. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models, and significant assumptions utilized. The Company follows the fair value hierarchy set forth in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value. The Company reviews and modifies, as necessary, the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Accordingly, there may be reclassifications between hierarchy levels due to changes in inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value.\nThe Company has numerous internal controls in place to ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements, including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurements. Certain valuations are benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available.\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions from observable market data used to estimate the Company's Level 2 fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to the Company's internal valuation models used to estimate Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayment speeds, credit losses, recovery rates and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, the Company's estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current market exchange.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which includes considerable judgment. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, including investments in subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that apply or will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse or be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance will be established if the Company determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires periodic analysis of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and when the deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods. Consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of deferred tax assets. The critical assumptions used in the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance analysis are as follows: (a) the expectation of future earnings; (b) estimates of the Company's long-term annual growth rate, based on the Company's long-term economic outlook in the U.S.; (c) estimates of the dividend income payout ratio from the Company's consolidated subsidiary, SC, based on current policies and practices of SC; (d) estimates of book income to tax income differences, based on the analysis of historical differences and the historical timing of the reversal of temporary differences; (e) the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid; (f) estimates of tax credits to be earned on current investments, based on the Company's evaluation of the credits applicable to each investment; (g) experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused; (h) estimates of applicable state tax rates based on current/most recent enacted tax rates and state apportionment calculations; (i) tax planning strategies; and (j) current tax laws. Significant judgment is required to assess future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences. The Company makes certain assertions in regards to its investment in subsidiaries, which impact whether a deferred tax liability is recorded for the book over tax basis difference in the investment in these subsidiaries. This requires the Company to make judgments with respect to its ability to permanently reinvest its earnings in foreign subsidiaries and its ability to recover its investment in domestic subsidiaries in a tax free manner.\nThe Company bases its expectations of future earnings, which are used to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets, on financial performance forecasts of its operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees. The budgets and estimates used in these forecasts are approved by the Company's management, and the assumptions underlying the forecasts are reviewed at least annually and adjusted as necessary based on current developments or when new information becomes available. The updates made and the variances between the Company's forecasts and its actual performance have not been significant enough to alter the Company's conclusions with regard to the realizability of its deferred tax asset. The Company continues to forecast sufficient taxable income to fully realize its current deferred tax assets. Forecasted taxable income is subject to changes in overall market and global economic conditions.\nIn establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws in the U.S., its states and", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 - MD&A\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nSHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA, a national banking association, and owns approximately 72.4% (as of December 31, 2019) of SC, a specialized consumer finance company. SHUSA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and the Bank's main office is in Wilmington, Delaware. SC is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Santander. SHUSA is also the parent company of Santander BanCorp , a holding company headquartered in Puerto Rico that offers a full range of financial services through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, BSPR; SSLLC, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in Boston; BSI, a financial services company headquartered in Miami that offers a full range of banking services to foreign individuals and corporations based primarily in Latin America; SIS, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in New York providing services in investment banking, institutional sales, trading and offering research reports of Latin American and European equity and fixed-income securities; and several other subsidiaries. SSLLC, SIS and another SHUSA subsidiary, Santander Asset Management, LLC, are registered investment advisers with the SEC.\nThe Bank's principal markets are in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. The Bank uses its deposits, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios. The Bank earns interest income on its loan and investment portfolios. In addition, the Bank generates non-interest income from a number of sources, including deposit and loan services, sales of loans and investment securities, capital markets products and BOLI. The principal non-interest expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and facility-related costs, technology and other administrative expenses. The financial results of the Bank are affected by the economic environment, including interest rates and consumer and business confidence and spending, as well as the competitive conditions within the Bank's geographic footprint.\nSC is a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing. SC's primary business is the indirect origination and securitization of RICs, principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to subprime retail consumers. Further information about SC's business is provided below in the Chrysler Capital\u201d section.\nSC is managed through a single reporting segment which included vehicle financial products and services, including RICs, vehicle leases, and dealer loans, as well as financial products and services related to recreational and marine vehicles and other consumer finance products.\nSC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, SC has other relationships through which it holds other consumer finance products. However, in 2015, SC announced its exit from personal lending and, accordingly, all of its personal lending assets are classified as HFS at December 31, 2019.\nChrysler Capital\nSince May 2013, under the ten-year private label financing agreement with FCA that became effective May 1, 2013 (the \"Chrysler Agreement\"), SC has operated as FCA's preferred provider for consumer loans, leases and dealer loans and provides services to FCA customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand. These products and services include consumer RICs and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit.\nChrysler Capital continues to be a focal point of the Company's strategy. On June 28, 2019, SC entered into an amendment to the Chrysler Agreement with FCA, which modified the Chrysler Agreement to, among other things, adjust certain performance metrics, exclusivity commitments and payment provisions under the Chrysler Agreement. The amendment also established an operating framework that is mutually beneficial for both parties for the remainder of the contract. The Company's average penetration rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 34%, an increase from 30% for the same period in 2018.\nSC has dedicated financing facilities in place for its Chrysler Capital business and has worked strategically and collaboratively with FCA to continue to strengthen its relationship and create value within the Chrysler Capital program. During the year ended December 31, 2019, SC originated $12.8 billion in Chrysler Capital loans, which represented 56% of the UPB of its total RIC originations, with an approximately even share between prime and non-prime, as well as $8.5 billion in Chrysler Capital leases. Additionally, substantially all of the leases originated by SC during the year ended December 31, 2019 were under the Chrysler Agreement. Since its May 2013 launch, Chrysler Capital has originated more than $65.9 billion in retail loans (excluding the SBNA RIC origination program) and purchased $41.9 billion in leases.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nOverview\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, unemployment remained low and year-to-date market results were positive, recovering from a volatile fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe unemployment rate at December 31, 2019 was 3.5% compared to 3.5% at September 30, 2019, and was lower compared to 3.9% one year ago. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment rose in the retail trade, and healthcare, while mining employment decreased.\nThe BEA advance estimate indicates that real gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.1% for the fourth quarter of 2019, consistent with the advance estimated growth of 2.1% for the third quarter of 2019. Growth continued to be driven by increases in personal consumption expenditures, federal government spending, and state and local government spending. In addition, imports, which are a subtraction to in the calculation of the gross domestic product, decreased. These positive contributions were offset by decreases to private inventory investment and non-residential fixed investments.\nMarket year-to-date returns for the following indices based on closing prices at December 31, 2019 were:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dow Jones Industrial Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P 500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASDAQ Composite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.8%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt its December 2019 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the federal funds rate target at 1.50%, to continue to support economic expansion, current strength in labor market conditions, and inflation near its targeted objective. Overall inflation remains below the targeted rate of 2.0%.\nThe ten-year Treasury bond rate at December 31, 2019 was 1.90%, down from 2.69% at December 31, 2018. Within the industry, changes in this metric are often considered to correspond to changes in 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates.\nCurrent mortgage origination and refinancing information is not yet available. Based on the most current information released based on September 2019 statistics, mortgage originations increased 29.74% year-over-year, which included an increased 6.21% in mortgage originations for home purchases and an increased 103.1% in mortgage originations from refinancing activity from the same period in 2018. These rates are representative of U.S. national average mortgage origination activity.\nThe ratio of NPLs to total gross loans for U.S. banks declined for six consecutive years, to just under 1.5% in 2015. NPL trends have remained relatively low since that time. NPLs for U.S. commercial banks were approximately 0.87% of loans using the latest available data, which was as of the third quarter of 2019, compared to 0.95% for the prior year.\nChanging market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the Company. The interest rate environment can present challenges in the growth of net interest income for the banking industry, which continues to rely on non-interest activities to support revenue growth. Changing market conditions and political uncertainty could have an overall impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Such conditions could also impact the Company's credit risk and the associated provision for credit losses and legal expense.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCredit Rating Actions\nThe following table presents Moody's, S&P and Fitch credit ratings for the Bank, BSPR, SHUSA, Santander, and the Kingdom of Spain, as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BANK\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BSPR(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHUSA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>Fitch\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>Fitch\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>Fitch\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa3\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-1\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>F-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-1/P-2\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>F-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>F-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SANTANDER\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SPAIN\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>Fitch\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>Fitch\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-1\n</td> <td>A-1\n</td> <td>F-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> <td>A-1\n</td> <td>F-1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) P-1 Short Term Deposit Rating; P-2 Short Term Debt Rating.\n(2) Outlook currently is Stable and under review with the possibility of a downgrade.\nMoody's announced completion of its periodic reviews and affirmed its ratings over SHUSA, SBNA and BSPR in March 2019. Spain in August 2019 and Santander in June 2019. Fitch affirmed its ratings and outlook for Spain in December 2019 and BSPR in October 2019.\nSHUSA funds its operations independently of the other entities owned by Santander, and believes its business is not necessarily closely related to the business or outlook of other entities owned by Santander. Future changes in the credit ratings of its parent, Santander, or the Kingdom of Spain, however, could impact SHUSA's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and any other change in the condition of Santander could affect SHUSA.\nAt this time, SC is not rated by the major credit rating agencies.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nThe activities of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank and SC, are subject to regulation under various U.S. federal laws and regulatory agencies which impose regulations, supervise and conduct examinations, and may affect the operations and management of the Company and its ability to take certain actions, including making distributions to our parent. The Company is regulated on a consolidated basis by the Federal Reserve, including the FRB of Boston, and the CFPB. The Company's banking and bank holding company subsidiaries are further supervised by the FDIC and the OCC. As a subsidiary of the Company, SC is also subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve as well as the CFPB. Santander BanCorp and BSPR also are supervised by the Puerto Rico Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions.\nPayment of Dividends\nSHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA and other consolidated subsidiaries, and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. SHUSA and SBNA are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain \"well-capitalized\" under prompt corrective action regulations. As a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, SC is included in various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends as described in the Stress Tests and Capital Adequacy\u201d discussion in this section. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A for detail of the capital actions of the Company and its subsidiaries during the period.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFBOs\nIn February 2014, the Federal Reserve issued the final rule implementing certain EPS mandated by the DFA. Under the Final Rule, FBOs with over $50 billion of U.S. non-branch assets, including Santander, were required to consolidate U.S. subsidiary activities under an IHC. In addition, the Final Rule required U.S. BHCs and FBOs with at least $50 billion in total U.S. consolidated non-branch assets to be subject to EPS and heightened capital, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements. Due to both its global and U.S. non-branch total consolidated asset size, Santander was subject to both of the above provisions of the Final Rule. As a result of this rule, Santander has transferred substantially all of its U.S. bank and non-bank subsidiaries previously outside the Company to the Company, which became an IHC effective July 1, 2016.\nEconomic Growth Act\nIn May 2018, the Economic Growth Act was signed into law. The Economic Growth Act scales back certain requirements of the DFA. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized a rulemaking implementing the changes required by the Economic Growth Act. The rulemaking provides a tailored approach to the EPS mandated by Section 165 of the DFA. Under the new tailored approach, banks are placed into different categories based on asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. The tailoring rule applies to both Santander and the Company. Both Santander and the Company were placed into Category four of the tailoring rule. The new tailored standards are discussed further below.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nU.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules are applicable to both SHUSA and the Bank and establish a comprehensive capital framework that includes both the advanced approaches for the largest internationally active U.S. banks, formerly known as Basel II, and a standardized approach that applies to all banking organizations with over $500 million in assets.\nThese rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and prompt corrective action thresholds that, when fully phased in, require banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter, of 4.0%. A further capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these minimum ratios was phased in effective January 1, 2019. This buffer is required for banking institutions and BHCs to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends.\nThese U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules include deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that MSRs, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities are deducted from CET1 to the extent any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 for the Company and the Bank began on January 1, 2015 and was initially planned over three years, with a fully phased-in requirement of January 1, 2018. However, during 2017, the regulatory agencies finalized changes to the capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2018. These changes extended the current treatment and deferred the final transition provision phase-in at non-advanced approach institutions for certain capital elements, and suspended the risk-weight to 100 percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital, in lieu of advancing to 250 percent. During 2019, the regulatory agencies approved a final rule which includes simplifications for non-advanced approaches to the generally applicable capital rules, specifically with regard to the treatment of minority interest, as well as modifying the risk-weight to 250 percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital. This final rule will become effective on April 1, 2020.\nSee the Bank Regulatory Capital section of this MD&A for the Company's capital ratios under Basel III standards. The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Company's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIf capital has reached the significantly or critically undercapitalized levels, further material restrictions can be imposed, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and, in critically undercapitalized situations, appointment of a receiver or conservator. Critically undercapitalized institutions generally may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt. All but well-capitalized institutions are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act and OCC regulations, institutions which are not categorized as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are restricted from making capital distributions, which include cash dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution. At December 31, 2019, the Bank met the criteria to be classified as well-capitalized.\u201d\nOn April 10, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a NPR seeking comment on a proposal to simplify capital rules for large banks. If finalized as proposed, the NPR would replace the capital conservation buffer. The capital conservation buffer would be replaced with a new SCB. The SCB is calculated as the maximum decline in CET1 in the severely adverse scenario (subject to a 2.5% floor) plus four quarters of dividends. The proposal would result in new regulatory capital minimums which are equal to 4.5% CET1 plus the SCB, any GSIB surcharge, and any countercyclical capital buffer. The GSIB buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to SHUSA. These new minimums would be firm-specific and would trigger restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses in the event a firm falls below their new minimums. Firms would still submit a capital plan annually. Supervisory expectations for capital planning processes would not change under the proposal. The Company does not expect this NPR, if finalized as proposed, to have a material impact on its current or future planned capital actions. This rule was finalized on March 4, 2020, and its impact is being evaluated.\nStress Testing and Capital Planning\nThe DFA also requires certain banks and BHCs, including the Company, to perform a stress test and submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve and receive a notice of non-objection before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. In June 2018, the Company announced that the Federal Reserve did not object to the planned capital actions described in the Company's capital plan through June 30, 2019. In February 2019, the Federal Reserve announced that SHUSA, as well as other less complex firms, would receive a one-year extension of the requirement to submit its capital plan until April 5, 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced that, for the period beginning July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, the Company would be allowed to make capital distributions up to the amount that would have allowed it to remain above all minimum capital requirements in CCAR 2018, adjusted for any changes in the Company's regulatory capital ratios since the Federal Reserve acted on the 2018 capital plan.\nIn October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that tailor the stress testing and capital actions a company is required to perform based on the company's asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. Under the tailoring rules, the Company is required to submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis. The Company is also subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle. The Company continues to evaluate planned capital actions in its annual capital plan and on an ongoing basis.\nLiquidity Rules\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC have established a rule to implement the Basel III LCR for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies, and a modified version of the LCR for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active. The LCR is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. Smaller covered companies (more than $50 billion in assets) such as the Company were required to calculate the LCR monthly beginning January 2016.\nIn October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that tailor the liquidity requirements based on a company's asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. In light of the fact that the Company is under $250 billion in assets and has less than $50 billion in short-term wholesale funding, the Company is no longer required to disclose the US LCR.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe NSFR is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon The NSFR requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on- and off-balance sheet activities, thereby reducing the likelihood that disruptions to a bank's regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity in a way that could increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress. In May 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule for NSFR applicable to U.S. financial institutions. The proposed rule has not been finalized, and the Company is currently evaluating the impact the proposed rule would have on its financial position, results of operations and disclosures.\nResolution Planning\nThe DFA requires all BHCs and FBOs with assets of $50 billion or more to prepare and regularly update resolution plans. The 165(d) Resolution Plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and that no extraordinary support\u201d is received from the U.S. or any other government. The most recent 165(d) Resolution Plan was submitted to the Federal Reserve and FDIC in December 2018. In addition, under amended Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act rules, the IDI resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of $50 billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors' rapid access to their insured deposits, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution. The most recent IDI resolution plan was submitted to the FDIC in June 2018. SHUSA and SBNA are currently awaiting feedback.\nTLAC\nThe TLAC Rule requires certain U.S. organizations to maintain a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments, including a minimum amount of unsecured LTD. The TLAC Rule applies to U.S. GSIBs and to IHCs with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important FBO. The Company is such an IHC.\nUnder the TLAC Rule, companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC, which consists of a minimum amount of LTD and Tier 1 capital. As a result, SHUSA must hold the higher of 18% of its RWAs or 9% of its total consolidated assets in the form of TLAC, of which 6% of its RWAs or 3.5% of total consolidated assets must consist of LTD. In addition, SHUSA must maintain a TLAC buffer composed solely of CET1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the TLAC buffer it maintains. The TLAC Rule became effective on January 1, 2019.\nVolcker Rule\nThe DFA added new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act, which is commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule.\u201d The Volcker Rule prohibits a banking entity\u201d from engaging in proprietary trading\u201d or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a Covered Fund: (i) acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in the Covered Fund; (ii) controlling the Covered Fund; or (iii) engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the Covered Fund. These prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities.\nBecause the term banking entity\u201d includes an IDI, a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates, the Volcker Rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as Santander, the Company, and certain of the Company's subsidiaries (including the Bank and SC), as well as other Santander subsidiaries in the United States and abroad.\nThe Company implemented certain policies and procedures, training programs, recordkeeping, internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the Volcker Rule. As required by the Volcker Rule, the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and Covered Fund activities. SHUSA's compliance program includes, among other things, processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the Volcker Rule, testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule.\nIn October 2019, the joint agencies responsible for administering the Volcker Rule finalized revisions to Volcker Rule. The final rule tailors the Volcker Rule's compliance requirements to the amount of a firm's trading activity, revise the definition of a trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and simplify the information companies are required to provide the banking agencies. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this final rule.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRisk Retention Rule\nIn December 2014, the Federal Reserve issued its final credit risk retention rule, which generally requires sponsors of ABS to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing ABS. SHUSA, primarily through SC, is an active participant in the structured finance markets and began to comply with the retention requirements effective in December 2016.\nMarket Risk Rule\nThe market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold risk-based regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions. The bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internal-risk based models. The market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the bank's internal risk based models, as well as qualitative requirements for the bank's management of market risk. Banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions.\nA bank is subject to the market risk capital rules if its consolidated trading activity, defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, equals the lesser of: (1) 10 percent or more of the bank's total assets as reported in its Call Report and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, or (2) $1 billion or more. At September 30, 2019, SBNA reported aggregate trading exposure in excess of the market risk threshold, and as a result, both the Company and SBNA began holding the market risk component within RWA of the risk-based capital ratios, and submitted the FFIEC 102 - Market Risk Regulatory Report beginning for the period ended December 31, 2019. The incorporation of market risk within regulatory capital has resulted in a decrease in the risk-based capital ratios.\nCapital Simplification Rule\nThe federal banking agencies are adopting a final rule that simplifies for non-advanced approaches banking organizations the generally applicable capital rules and makes a number of technical corrections. Specifically, it reverses the previous transition provision freeze on MSRs and deferred tax assets by modifying the risk-weight from 100% to 250%. The rule will also replace the existing methodology for calculating includible minority interest with a flat 10% limit at each capital level. The increased risk weighting presents an unfavorable decline to the Company's risk-based ratios, but it is estimated that the Tier 1 and total capital ratios will improve overall due to the additional minority interest includible under the simplified rule. The capital simplification rule becomes effective April 1, 2020; however, regulators have granted the option for institutions to adopt early on January 1, 2020. The Company plans to adopt this new rule on April 1, 2020.\nHeightened Standards\nOCC guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions are commonly referred to as heightened standards.\u201d The heightened standards apply to insured national banks with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. The heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions' boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework.\nTransactions with Affiliates\nDepository institutions must remain in compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve's Regulation W, which governs transactions of the Company and its banking subsidiaries with affiliated companies and individuals. Section 23A imposes limits on certain specified covered transactions,\u201d which include loans, lines, and letters of credit to affiliated companies or individuals, and investments in affiliated companies, as well as certain other transactions with affiliated companies and individuals. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to 10% of a bank's capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20% for all affiliates. Certain covered transactions also must meet collateral requirements that range from 100% to 130% depending on the type of transaction.\nSection 23B of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits a depository institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are considered arms'-length. To meet the definition of arm's-length, the terms of the transaction must be the same, or at least as favorable, as those for similar transactions with non-affiliated companies. As a U.S. domiciled subsidiary of a global parent with significant non-bank affiliates, the Company faces elevated compliance risk in this area.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRegulation AB II\nRegulation AB II, among other things, expanded disclosure requirements and modified the offering and shelf registration process for ABS. SC must comply with these rules, which impact all offerings of publicly registered ABS and all reports under the Exchange Act, for outstanding publicly-registered ABS, and affect SC's public securitization platform.\nCRA\nSBNA and BSPR are subject to the requirements of the CRA, which requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which it is located. BSPR's current CRA rating is Outstanding\u201d and SBNA's current CRA rating is \"Satisfactory.\" The OCC takes into account the Bank's CRA rating in considering certain regulatory applications the Bank makes, including applications related to establishing and relocating branches, and the Federal Reserve does the same with respect to certain regulatory applications the Company makes.\nOn December 12, 2019, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued the CRA NPR to modernize the regulatory framework implementing the CRA. The CRA NPR generally focuses on clarifying and expanding the activities that qualify for CRA consideration, providing benchmarks to determine what levels of activity are necessary to obtain a particular CRA rating, establishing additional assessment areas based on the location of a bank's deposits, and increasing clarity and consistency in reporting. The CRA NPR contemplates that regulators will provide a publicly available, non-exhaustive list of activities that would automatically receive CRA consideration. In addition, the CRA NPR allows banks to receive consideration for certain qualifying activities conducted outside their assessment areas. It currently is unclear when and in what manner the OCC and FDIC will finalize the CRA NPR.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nOn February 25, 2015, SC entered into a consent order with the DOJ, approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, which resolved the DOJ's claims against SC that certain of its repossession and collection activities during the period of time between January 2008 and February 2013 violated the SCRA. The consent order required SC to pay a civil fine in the amount of $55,000, as well as at least $9.4 million to affected service members, consisting of $10,000 per service member plus compensation for any lost equity (with interest) for each repossession by SC and $5,000 per service member for each instance where SC sought to collect repossession-related fees on accounts for which a repossession was conducted by a prior account-holder. The consent order required SC to undertake additional remedial measures. The consent order also subjected SC to monitoring by the DOJ for compliance with the SCRA for a period of five years. The consent order terminated as of February 26, 2019.\nOn March 21, 2017, SC and the Company entered into a written agreement with the FRB of Boston. Under the terms of that agreement, SC is required to enhance its compliance risk management program, board oversight of risk management and senior management oversight of risk management, and the Company is required to enhance its oversight of SC's management and operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, SSLLC had received 751 FINRA arbitration cases related to Puerto Rico bonds and Puerto Rico CEFs that SSLLC previously recommended and/or sold to clients. Most of these cases are based upon concerns regarding the local Puerto Rico securities market. The statements of claims allege, among other things, fraud, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, unsuitability, over-concentration and failure to supervise. There were 439 arbitration cases pending as of December 31, 2019. The Company has experienced a decrease in the volume of claims since September 30, 2019; however, it is reasonably possible that it could experience an increase in claims in future periods.\nOn August 8, 2019, bond insurers National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation and MBIA Insurance Corporation filed suit in Puerto Rico state court against eight Puerto Rico municipal bond underwriters, including SSLLC, alleging that the underwriters made misrepresentations in connection with the issuance of the debt and that the bond insurers relied on such misrepresentations in agreeing to insure certain of the bonds. The complaint alleges damages of not less than $720 million. The defendants removed the case to federal court, and plaintiffs have sought to return the case to state court.\nIn addition, SSLLC, Santander BanCorp, BSPR, the Company and Santander are defendants in a putative class action alleging federal securities and common law claims relating to the solicitation and purchase of more than $180 million of Puerto Rico bonds and $101 million of CEFs during the period from December 2012 to October 2013. The case is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and is captioned Jorge Ponsa-Rabell, et. al. v. SSLLC, Civ. No. 3:17-cv-02243. The amended complaint alleges that defendants acted in concert to defraud purchasers in connection with the underwriting and sale of Puerto Rico municipal bonds, CEFs and open-end funds. In May 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act\nPursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law.\nThe following activities are disclosed in response to Section 13(r) with respect to affiliates of SHUSA within the Santander Group. During the period covered by this annual report:\n \u2022 Santander UK holds accounts for two customers, with the first customer holding one savings account and one current account and the second customer holding one savings account. Both of the customers, who are resident in the UK, are currently designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program. Revenues and profits generated by Santander UK on these accounts in the year ended December 31, 2019 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Santander. \n \u2022 During the period covered by this annual report, Santander UK held one savings account with a balance of \u00a31.24, and one current account with a balance of \u00a31,884.53, for another customer resident in the UK who is currently designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program. The customer relationship pre-dates the designations of the customer under these sanctions. The United Nations and European Union removed this customer from their equivalent sanctions lists in 2008. Santander UK determined to put a block on these accounts, and the accounts were subsequently closed on 14 January 2019. Revenues and profits generated by Santander UK on these accounts in the year ended December 31, 2019 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Santander. \n \u2022 Santander UK holds two frozen current accounts for two UK nationals who are designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program. The accounts held by each customer have been frozen since their designation and remained frozen through the year ended December 31, 2019. The accounts are in arrears (\u00a31,844.73 in debit combined) and are currently being managed by Santander UK's Collections and Recoveries Department. No revenues or profits were generated by Santander UK on these accounts in the year ended December 31, 2019. \n \u2022 The Santander Group also has certain legacy performance guarantees for the benefit of Bank Sepah and Bank Mellat (stand-by letters of credit to guarantee the obligations - either under tender documents or under contracting agreements - of contractors who participated in public bids in Iran) that were in place prior to April 27, 2007. \n \u2022 During the period covered by this annual report, Santander Brasil held one current account with a balance of R$100.00 for a customer resident in Brazil who is currently designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program. The customer relationship pre-dates the designation of the customer under these sanctions. Santander Brasil determined to terminate the account even prior to the customer being formally designated under the SDGT sanctions program on September 10, 2019, and the account was subsequently closed on October 9, 2019. Revenues and profits generated by Santander Brasil on this account in the year ended December 31, 2019 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Santander. \nIn the aggregate, all of the transactions described above resulted in gross revenues and net profits in the year ended December 31, 2019 which were negligible relative to the overall revenues and profits of Santander. Santander has undertaken significant steps to withdraw from the Iranian market, such as closing its representative office in Iran and ceasing all banking activities therein, including correspondent relationships, deposit-taking from Iranian entities and issuing export letters of credit, except for the legacy transactions described above. Santander is not contractually permitted to cancel these arrangements without either (i) paying the guaranteed amount (in the case of the performance guarantees), or (ii) forfeiting the outstanding amounts due to it (in the case of the export credits). As such, Santander intends to continue to provide the guarantees and hold these assets in accordance with company policy and applicable laws.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThis MD&A is based on the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, accordingly, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. However, the Company is not currently aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results. Management identified accounting for ALLL and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, estimates of expected residual values of leased vehicles subject to operating leases, accretion of discounts and subvention on RICs, goodwill, fair value measurements and income taxes as the Company's most critical accounting estimates, in that they are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nALLL for Loan Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\nThe ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments represent management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of SHUSA's ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is regularly evaluated. This evaluation process is subject to several estimates and applications of judgment. Management's evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb loan and lease losses takes into consideration the risks in the loan portfolio, past loan and lease loss experience, specific loans that have loss potential, geographic and industry concentrations, delinquency trends, economic conditions, the level of originations and other relevant factors. Management also considers loan quality, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, the amount of NPLs, and industry trends. Changes in these estimates could have a direct material impact on the provision for credit losses recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and/or could result in a change in the recorded allowance and reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The loan portfolio represents the largest asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the methodology used to determine the ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the periods presented is included in the Credit Risk Management section of this MD&A.\nThe ALLL includes: (i) an allocated allowance, which is comprised of allowances established on loans specifically evaluated for impairment and loans collectively evaluated for impairment, based on historical loan and lease loss experience adjusted for current trends general economic conditions and other risk factors, and (ii) an unallocated allowance to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process. Generally, the Company's loans held for investment are carried at amortized cost, net of the ALLL. The ALLL includes the estimate of credit losses to be realized during the loss emergence period based on the recorded investment in the loan, including net discounts that are expected at the time of charge-off. In the case of loans purchased in a bulk purchase or business combination, the entire discount on the loan portfolio is considered as available to absorb the credit losses when determining the ALLL. For these loans, the Company records provisions for credit losses when incurred losses exceed the unaccreted purchase discount. Reserve levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly.\nThe Company's allocated reserves are principally based on various models subject to the Company's Model Risk Management Framework. New models are approved by the Company's Model Risk Management Committee. Models, inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually, and the Company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Committee.\nThe Company's unallocated allowance is no more than 5% of the overall allowance. This is considered to be reasonably sufficient to absorb imprecisions of models to otherwise provide for coverage of inherent losses in the Company's entire loan and lease portfolio. Imprecisions include loss factors in the loan portfolio that may not have been discreetly contemplated in the general and specific components of the allowance, as well as potential variability in estimates. Period-to-period changes in the Company's historical unallocated ALLL positions are considered in light of these factors.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nValuation of Automotive Lease Assets and Residuals\nThe Company has significant investments in vehicles in SC's operating lease portfolio. In accounting for operating leases, management must make a determination at the beginning of the lease contract of the estimated realizable value (i.e., residual value) of the vehicle at the end of the lease. Residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to four years. At contract inception, the Company determines the projected residual value based on an internal evaluation of the expected future value. This evaluation is based on a proprietary model using internally-generated data that is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness. The customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a finance charge. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, the Company is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception. Management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of leased vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of leased assets.\nTo account for residual risk, the Company depreciates automobile operating lease assets to estimated realizable value on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The estimated realizable value is initially based on the residual value established at contract inception. Periodically, the Company revises the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and other relevant data points, and adjusts depreciation expense appropriately over the remaining term of the lease.\nThe Company periodically evaluates its investment in operating leases for impairment if circumstances, such as a systemic and material decline in used vehicle values occurs. These circumstances could include, for example, a decline in the residual value of our lease portfolio due to an event caused by shocks to oil and gas prices (which may have a pronounced impact on certain models of vehicles) or pervasive manufacturer defects (which may systemically affect the value of a particular brand or model). Impairment is determined to exist if the fair value of the leased asset is less than its carrying value and it is determined that the net carrying value is not recoverable. The net carrying value of a leased asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon eventual disposition. If our operating lease assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value as estimated by DCF. No such impairment was recognized in 2019, 2018, or 2017.\nThe Company's depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers management's expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination, which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values. The critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automobile lease assets include: (1) estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values, (2) proper identification and estimation of business conditions, (3) our remarketing abilities, and (4) automobile manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the value of the lease residuals. Expected residual values include estimates of payments from automobile manufacturers\nrelated to residual support and risk-sharing agreements, if any. To the extent an automotive manufacturer is not able to fully honor its obligation relative to these agreements, the Company's depreciation expense would be negatively impacted.\nAccretion of Discounts and Subvention on RICs\nLHFI include the RIC portfolio which consists largely of nonprime automobile loans, and which are primarily acquired individually from dealers at a nonrefundable discount from the contractual principal amount. The Company also pays dealer participation on certain receivables. The amortization of discounts, subvention payments from manufacturers, and other origination costs are recognized as adjustments to the yield of the related contracts. The Company applies significant assumptions, including prepayment speeds, in estimating the accretion rates used to approximate effective yield.\nThe Company estimates future principal prepayments specific to pools of homogeneous loans which are based on the vintage, credit quality at origination and term of the loan. Prepayments in our portfolio are sensitive to credit quality, with higher credit quality loans experiencing higher voluntary prepayment rates than lower credit quality loans. The impact of defaults is not considered in the prepayment rate; the prepayment rate only considers voluntary prepayments. The resulting prepayment rate specific to each pool is based on historical experience and is used as an input in the calculation of the constant effective yield.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGoodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the Company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities represents goodwill. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized on a recurring basis, but rather are subject to periodic impairment testing.\nAs more fully described in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. The Company conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 1, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. As of December 31, 2019, the reporting units with assigned goodwill were Consumer and Business Banking, C&I, CRE & VF, CIB, and SC.\nAn entity's quantitative goodwill impairment analysis must be completed unless the entity determines, based on certain qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, including goodwill, and that no impairment exists. An entity has an unconditional option to bypass the preceding qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test.\nThe quantitative analysis requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including its allocated goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value, impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. A recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit, and cannot subsequently be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers. The Company utilizes the market capitalization approach to determine the fair value of its SC reporting unit, as it is a publicly traded company that has a single reporting unit. Determining the fair value of the remaining reporting units requires significant valuation inputs, assumptions, and estimates.\nThe Company determines the carrying value of each reporting unit using a risk-based capital approach. Certain of the Company's assets are assigned to a Corporate/Other category. These assets are related to the Company's corporate-only programs, such as BOLI, and are not employed in or related to the operations of a reporting unit or considered in determining the fair value of a reporting unit.\nGoodwill impairment testing involves management's judgment, requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value. This is performed using widely-accepted valuation techniques, such as the guideline public company market approach (earnings and price-to-tangible book value multiples of comparable public companies), the market capitalization approach (share price of the reporting unit and control premium of comparable public companies), and the income approach (the DCF method). The Company uses a combination of these accepted methodologies to determine the fair valuation of reporting units. Several factors are taken into account, including actual operating results, future business plans, economic projections, and market data.\nThe guideline public company market approach (\"market approach\") includes earnings and price-to-tangible book value multiples of comparable public companies which were applied to the earnings and equity for all of the Company's reporting units. The market capitalization plus control premium approach was applied to the Company's SC reporting unit, as the SC reporting unit is a publicly traded subsidiary whose securities are traded in an active market.\nIn connection with the market capitalization plus control premium approach applied to the Company's SC reporting unit, the Company used SC's stock price as of the date of the annual impairment analysis. The Company also considered historical auto loan industry transactions and control premiums over the last three years in determining the control premium.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe DCF method of the income approach incorporates the reporting units' forecasted cash flows, including a terminal value to estimate the fair value of cash flows beyond the final year of the forecasts. The discount rates utilized to obtain the net present value of the reporting units' cash flows were estimated using a capital asset pricing model. Significant inputs to this model include a risk-free rate of return, beta (which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit), market equity risk premium, and, in certain cases, additional premium for size and/or unsystematic company-specific risk factors. The Company utilized discount rates that it believes adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets. The Company estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit. The Company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, so actual results may differ from forecasted results.\nAll of the preceding fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions in the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impacts the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units include such items as:\n \u2022 a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate; \n \u2022 an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree; \n \u2022 volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates and unexpected regulatory changes; \n \u2022 Specific to the SC reporting unit, a decrease in SC's share price would impact the fair value of the reporting segment. \nRefer to the Financial Condition, Goodwill section of this MD&A for further details on the Company's goodwill, including the results of management's goodwill impairment analyses.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company uses fair value measurements to estimate the fair value of certain assets and liabilities for both measurement and disclosure purposes. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models, and significant assumptions utilized. The Company follows the fair value hierarchy set forth in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value. The Company reviews and modifies, as necessary, the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Accordingly, there may be reclassifications between hierarchy levels due to changes in inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value.\nThe Company has numerous internal controls in place to ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements, including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurements. Certain valuations are benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available.\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions from observable market data used to estimate the Company's Level 2 fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to the Company's internal valuation models used to estimate Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayment speeds, credit losses, recovery rates and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, the Company's estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current market exchange.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which includes considerable judgment. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, including investments in subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that apply or will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse or be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance will be established if the Company determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires periodic analysis of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and when the deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods. Consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of deferred tax assets. The critical assumptions used in the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance analysis are as follows: (a) the expectation of future earnings; (b) estimates of the Company's long-term annual growth rate, based on the Company's long-term economic outlook in the U.S.; (c) estimates of the dividend income payout ratio from the Company's consolidated subsidiary, SC, based on current policies and practices of SC; (d) estimates of book income to tax income differences, based on the analysis of historical differences and the historical timing of the reversal of temporary differences; (e) the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid; (f) estimates of tax credits to be earned on current investments, based on the Company's evaluation of the credits applicable to each investment; (g) experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused; (h) estimates of applicable state tax rates based on current/most recent enacted tax rates and state apportionment calculations; (i) tax planning strategies; and (j) current tax laws. Significant judgment is required to assess future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences. The Company makes certain assertions in regards to its investment in subsidiaries, which impact whether a deferred tax liability is recorded for the book over tax basis difference in the investment in these subsidiaries. This requires the Company to make judgments with respect to its ability to permanently reinvest its earnings in foreign subsidiaries and its ability to recover its investment in domestic subsidiaries in a tax free manner.\nThe Company bases its expectations of future earnings, which are used to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets, on financial performance forecasts of its operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees. The budgets and estimates used in these forecasts are approved by the Company's management, and the assumptions underlying the forecasts are reviewed at least annually and adjusted as necessary based on current developments or when new information becomes available. The updates made and the variances between the Company's forecasts and its actual performance have not been significant enough to alter the Company's conclusions with regard to the realizability of its deferred tax asset. The Company continues to forecast sufficient taxable income to fully realize its current deferred tax assets. Forecasted taxable income is subject to changes in overall market and global economic conditions.\nIn establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws in the U.S., its states and"}
