Our investment objective is to maximize our investment portfolio's total return by generating current income from the debt investments we make and capital appreciation from the warrants we receive when making such debt investments. We are focused on making Venture Loans to venture capital backed companies in our Target Industries, which we refer to as Venture Lending.\u201d We also selectively provide Venture Loans to publicly traded companies in our Target Industries. Our debt investments are typically secured by first liens or first liens behind a secured revolving line of credit, or Senior Term Loans. As of December 31, 2016, 97.4%, or $181.4 million, of our debt investment portfolio at fair value consisted of Senior Term Loans. Venture Lending is typically characterized by (1) the making of a secured debt investment after a venture capital or equity investment in the portfolio company has been made, which investment provides a source of cash to fund the portfolio company's debt service obligations under the Venture Loan, (2) the senior priority of the Venture Loan which requires repayment of the Venture Loan prior to the equity investors realizing a return on their capital, (3) the relatively rapid amortization of the Venture Loan and (4) the lender's receipt of warrants or other success fees with the making of the Venture Loan.\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowing. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. As a RIC, we generally are not subject to corporate-level income taxes on our investment company taxable income and our net capital gain that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders as long as we meet certain source-of-income, distribution, asset diversification and other requirements.\nCompass Horizon, our predecessor company, commenced operations in March 2008. We were formed in March 2010 for the purpose of acquiring Compass Horizon and continuing its business as a public entity.\nOur investment activities, and our day-to-day operations, are managed by our Advisor and supervised by our Board, of which a majority of the members are independent of us. Under the Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Advisor a base management fee and an incentive fee for its advisory services to us. We have also entered into the Administration Agreement with our Advisor under which we have agreed to reimburse our Advisor for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our Advisor in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.\nPortfolio composition and investment activity\nThe following table shows our portfolio by type of investment as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nInvestments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nof Total\nPortfolio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nInvestments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nof Total\nPortfolio\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Term loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>242,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Warrants </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows total portfolio investment activity as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Beginning portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>205,101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>New debt investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,281 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Principal payments received on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,403 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,016 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Early pay-offs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46,357 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,624 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accretion of debt investment fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>New debt investment fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(931 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,147 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>New equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sale of investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(984 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,669 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net realized loss on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,696 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,620 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net depreciation on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,397 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(490 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ending portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,267 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances.

A rating of 2 represents an increased level of risk and, while no loss is currently anticipated for a 2-rated debt investment, there is potential for future loss of principal. A rating of 1 represents a deteriorating credit quality and a high degree of risk of loss of principal. Our internal credit rating system is not a national credit rating system. See Item 1 - Business\u201d for a more detailed description of the internal credit rating system. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our debt investments had a weighted average credit rating of 3.0.

The consolidated results of operations described below may not be indicative of the results we report in future periods.\nThe following table shows consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,984 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,254 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,377 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net investment income before excise tax </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,877 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Credit) provision for excise tax </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,717 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net realized loss on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,776 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,650 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,576 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,236 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(490 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,289 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (decrease) increase in net assets resulting from operations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,913 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,430 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average debt investments, at fair value </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>221,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>219,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>204,862 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average borrowings outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,976 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,754 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments. As a result, annual comparisons of net increase in net assets resulting from operations may not be meaningful.\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment income\nTotal investment income increased by $1.9 million, or 6.0%, to $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, total investment income consisted primarily of $31.4 million in interest income from investments, which included $8.3 million in income from the accretion of origination fees and ETPs and $1.6 million in fee income. Interest income on investments increased by $2.7 million, or 9.6%, to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income on investments increased primarily due to the larger amount of ETPs earned during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Fee income, which includes success fee and prepayment fee income on debt investments, decreased by $0.9 million, or 35.5%, primarily due to a lower average prepayment fee rate earned during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, along with a lower amount of success fees earned during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal investment income remained flat at $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, total investment income consisted primarily of $28.7 million in interest income from investments, which included $4.5 million in income from the accretion of origination fees and ETPs, and $2.5 million in fee income. Interest income on investments remained flat at $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest income on investments remained flat due to an increase in the average size of our investment portfolio of $15.0 million, or 7.3%, which was offset by lower acceleration of fees and ETPs from prepayments. Fee income, which includes prepayment fee income and fee income on debt investments, decreased by $0.2 million, or 6.0%, primarily due to a lower aggregate amount of principal prepayments for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments was 14.9%, 14.2% and 15.3%, respectively. We calculate the yield on dollar-weighted average debt investments for any period measured as (1) total investment income during the period divided by (2) the average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield represents the portfolio yield and will be higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by investors.\nInvestment income, consisting of interest income and fees on debt investments, can fluctuate significantly upon repayment of large debt investments. Interest income from the five largest debt investments in the aggregate accounted for 17%, 14% and 20% of investment income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nExpenses\nTotal net expenses decreased by $1.1 million, or 6.7%, to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Total net expenses decreased by $3.3 million, or 16.0%, to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Total expenses for each period consisted of interest expense, base management fee, incentive and administrative fees, professional fees and general and administrative expenses.\nInterest expense increased by $0.1 million, or 2.1%, to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense, which includes the amortization of debt issuance costs, increased primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of $14.9 million, or 16.9%, which was partially offset by a decrease in our effective cost of debt for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense decreased by $3.0 million, or 33.9%, to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in average borrowings of $14.8 million, or 14.4%, along with a decrease in our effective cost of debt for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nBase management fee expense increased by $0.3 million, or 7.4%, to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, after giving effect to waivers of $0.3 million in base management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015. Base management fee increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to the waiver of base management fees of $0.3 million in 2015 in connection with the 2015 Offering, as described below. Base management fee expense, net of waivers, remained flat at $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Base management fee expense remained flat primarily due to our Advisor's waiver of base management fees of $0.3 million relating to the 2015 Offering, as described below, offset by an increase in our average gross assets of $6.4 million, or 2.6%.\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs noted above, our Advisor agreed to waive its base management fee relating to the proceeds raised in the 2015 Offering, to the extent such fee was not otherwise waived and regardless of the application of the proceeds raised, until the earlier to occur of (i) March 31, 2016 or (ii) the last day of the second consecutive calendar quarter in which our net investment income exceeds distributions declared on shares of our common stock for the applicable quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our Advisor waived $0.3 million of base management fees. As of December 31, 2015, condition (ii) above had been met, as our net investment income exceeded distributions declared for the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015.\nPerformance based incentive fee expense decreased by $1.4 million, or 39.3%, to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Performance based incentive fee expense decreased because the incentive fee expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016 was limited by the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism under our Investment Management Agreement. This resulted in $1.7 million of reduced expense and additional net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was subject to the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism due to net realized and unrealized losses in the portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaling $22.0 million. Performance based incentive fee expense, net of waivers, increased by $1.5 million, or 74.6%, to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Performance based incentive fee expense increased primarily due to higher Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAdministrative fee expense decreased by $0.3 million, or 22.7%, to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Administrative fee expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in our allocated costs of compensation incurred by the Advisor on our behalf for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Administrative fee expense remained flat at $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn 2016 and 2015, we elected to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company elected to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions of $1.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016, excise tax payable of $0.1 million was recorded. At December 31, 2015, no excise tax payable was recorded.\nProfessional fees and general and administrative expenses primarily include legal and audit fees and insurance premiums. These expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were unchanged at $2.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $1.8 million, or 43.7%, to $2.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to decreased legal fees and other costs associated with certain non-accrual investments and other assets.\nNet realized gains and losses and net unrealized appreciation and depreciation\nRealized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains or losses on investments include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized net losses totaling $7.8 million primarily due to the resolution of three debt investments. One debt investment was settled for net cash proceeds of $3.6 million, which resulted in a realized loss of $4.5 million and unrealized appreciation of $4.6 million. One debt investment was settled for net cash proceeds of $0.2 million and a royalty and sale agreement fair valued at $0.4 million, which resulted in a realized loss of $2.2 million and unrealized appreciation of $2.2 million. One debt investment was settled for cash proceeds which resulted in a realized loss of $0.9 million and unrealized appreciation of $0.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we realized net losses totaling $1.7 million primarily due to the resolution of one debt investment partially offset by realized gains on the sale of equity received upon the exercise of warrants. The debt investment was settled for a net cash payment of $4.9 million, which resulted in a realized loss of $1.8 million and unrealized appreciation of $1.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized net losses totaling $3.6 million primarily due to the resolution of three debt investments which were partially offset by realized gains on the sale of equity received upon the exercise of warrants. As a result of the resolution of the three debt investments, we recognized $5.0 million of realized net losses and $7.6 million of unrealized appreciation.\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled $14.2 million which was primarily due to the unrealized depreciation on three debt investments offset by the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on one debt investment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled $0.5 million which was primarily due to the unrealized depreciation on one debt investment offset by the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on one debt investment that was settled during the period, described above. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net unrealized appreciation on investments totaled $8.3 million which was primarily due to the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on four debt investments.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and investments in money market funds of $37.1 million and $21.1 million, respectively. Cash and investments in money market funds are available to fund new investments, reduce borrowings, pay expenses, repurchase common stock and pay distributions. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had $1.1 million of restricted investments in money market funds. Restricted investments in money market funds were primarily used to make monthly interest and principal payments on our Asset-Backed Notes. Our primary sources of capital have been from our public and private equity offerings, use of our revolving credit facilities and issuance of our 2019 Notes and the Asset-Backed Notes.\nOn March 24, 2015, we completed a public offering of 2.0 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $26.5 million, after deducting underwriting commission and discounts and other offering expenses. We generally used the net proceeds from this offering to make investments, to repurchase or pay down liabilities and for general corporate purposes.\nOn July 29, 2016, our Board extended a previously authorized stock repurchase program which allows us to repurchase up to $5.0 million of our common stock at prices below our net asset value per share as reported in our most recent consolidated financial statements. Under the repurchase program, we may, but are not obligated to, repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time. Any repurchases by us will comply with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act and any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Unless extended by our Board, the repurchase program will terminate on the earlier of June 30, 2017 or the repurchase of $5.0 million of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 48,160 shares of our common stock at an average price of $10.66 on the open market for a total cost of $0.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 113,382 shares of our common stock at an average price of $11.53 on the open market for a total cost of $1.3 million. From the inception of the stock repurchase program through December 31, 2016, we repurchased 161,542 shares of our common stock at an average price of $11.27 on the open market at a total cost of $1.8 million.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, the outstanding principal balance under the Key Facility was $63.0 million and $68.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had borrowing capacity under the Key Facility of $32.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, $4.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, was available, subject to existing terms and advance rates.\nOur operating activities provided cash of $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our financing activities used cash of $35.9 million for the same period. Our operating activities provided cash primarily from principal payments received on our debt investments, partially offset by investments made in portfolio companies. Our financing activities used cash primarily to pay off our Asset-Backed Notes and pay distributions to our stockholders.\nOur operating activities used cash of $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our financing activities provided cash of $43.7 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for investments made in portfolio companies, partially offset by principal payments received on our debt investments. Our financing activities provided cash primarily from the 2015 Offering and advances on our Key Facility of $58.0 million, which was partially offset by cash used to pay down our Asset-Backed Notes, pay distributions to our stockholders and repurchase common stock under the stock repurchase program.\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating activities provided cash of $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our financing activities used cash of $53.6 million for the same period. Our operating activities provided cash primarily from principal payments received on debt investments, partially offset by investments made in portfolio companies. Our financing activities used cash primarily to pay down borrowings and pay distributions to our stockholders.\nOur primary use of available funds is to make debt investments in portfolio companies and for general corporate purposes. We expect to raise additional equity and debt capital opportunistically as needed, and subject to market conditions, to support our future growth to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.\nIn order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we intend to distribute to our stockholders all or substantially all of our investment company taxable income. In addition, as a BDC, we are required to maintain asset coverage of at least 200%. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash generated from operations, and funds available from our Key Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure commitments for at least the next 12 months.\nCurrent borrowings\nThe following table shows our borrowings as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nCommitment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance\nOutstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Unused\nCommitment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nCommitment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance\nOutstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Unused\nCommitment </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asset-Backed Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Key Facility </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 Notes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total before debt issuance costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unamortized debt issuance costs attributable to term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(403 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(592 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total borrowings outstanding, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>114,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 12, 2015, we amended the Key Facility to (1) add a $20 million commitment to the existing $50 million commitment and (2) extend the term of the Key Facility. On April 27, 2016, we further added a $25 million commitment to our existing $70 million commitment. The interest rate on the Key Facility is based upon the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a spread of 3.25%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. The LIBOR rate was 0.77% and 0.43% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The interest rate in effect was 4.00% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nThe Key Facility has an accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total loan commitment to $150 million. The Key Facility is collateralized by debt investments held by Credit II and permits an advance rate of up to fifty percent (50%) of eligible debt investments held by Credit II. The Key Facility contains covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum net worth, to restrict the debt investments securing the Key Facility to certain criteria for qualified debt investments and to comply with portfolio company concentration limits as defined in the related loan agreement. We may request advances under the Key Facility through August 12, 2018, or the Revolving Period. After the Revolving Period, we may not request new advances, and we must repay the outstanding advances under the Key Facility as of such date, at such times and in such amounts as are necessary to maintain compliance with the terms and conditions of the Key Facility, particularly the condition that the principal balance of the Key Facility not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate principal balance of our eligible debt investments to our portfolio companies. All outstanding advances under the Key Facility are due and payable on August 12, 2020.\nOn March 23, 2012, we issued and sold an aggregate principal amount of $30 million 2019 Notes, and on April 18, 2012, pursuant to the underwriters' 30-day option to purchase additional notes, we sold an additional $3 million of the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes will mature on March 15, 2019 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time or from time to time at a redemption price of $25 per security plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2019 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.375% per year payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes are our direct, unsecured obligations and (1) rank equally in right of payment with our future unsecured indebtedness; (2) are senior in right of payment to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2019 Notes; (3) are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and (4) are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, we were in material compliance with the terms of the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes are listed on the NYSE under the symbol HTF\u201d.\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Horizon Credit III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, entered into a term loan credit facility, or the Term Loan Facility, with Fortress Credit Co LLC on August 23, 2012. The interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was based upon the one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 6.00%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00% and provided for a four-year drawing period. The Term Loan Facility contained customary covenants for a facility of its type. Effective June 17, 2014, we terminated the Term Loan Facility and a related loan and security agreement and other documents.\nOn June 28, 2013, we completed the 2013-1 Securitization. In connection with the 2013-1 Securitization, 2013-1 Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, issued $90 million in the Asset-Backed Notes, which were rated A1(sf) by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. The Asset-Backed Notes were issued by 2013-1 Trust and were backed by a pool of loans made to certain portfolio companies of ours and secured by certain assets of such portfolio companies. The Asset-Backed Notes were secured obligations of 2013-1 Trust and non-recourse to us. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Asset-Backed Notes, we made customary representations, warranties and covenants. The Asset-Backed Notes bore interest at a fixed rate of 3.00% per annum and had a stated maturity of May 15, 2018. As of December 31, 2016, the Asset-Backed Notes were repaid in full.\nUnder the terms of the Asset-Backed Notes, we were required to maintain a reserve cash balance, funded through principal collections from the underlying securitized debt portfolio, which could have been used to make monthly interest and principal payments on the Asset-Backed Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, other assets were $2.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, which is primarily comprised of debt issuance costs and prepaid expenses.\nContractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements\nThe following table shows our significant contractual payment obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unfunded commitments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the normal course of business, we are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These consist primarily of unfunded commitments to extend credit, in the form of loans, to our portfolio companies. Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our balance sheet. Our unfunded commitments may be significant from time to time. As of December 31, 2016, we had unfunded commitments of $20.8 million. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance requirements as are the financial instruments that we hold on our balance sheet. In addition, these commitments are often subject to financial or non-financial milestones and other conditions to borrowing that must be achieved before the commitment can be drawn. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We regularly monitor our unfunded commitments and anticipated refinancings, maturities and capital raising, to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to fund such unfunded commitments. As of December 31, 2016, we reasonably believed that our assets would provide adequate financial resources to satisfy all of our unfunded commitments.\nIn addition to the Key Facility, we have certain commitments pursuant to our Investment Management Agreement entered into with our Advisor. We have agreed to pay a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components (1) a base management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets less cash or cash equivalents, and (2) a two-part incentive fee. We have also entered into a contract with our Advisor to serve as our administrator. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of our Advisor's overhead in performing its obligations under the agreement, including rent, fees and other expenses inclusive of our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our Investment Management Agreement and our Administration Agreement.\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistributions\nIn order to qualify and be subject to tax as a RIC, we must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. Generally, in order to qualify as a RIC, we must derive at least 90% of our gross income for each tax year from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in stock or other securities. We must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of each tax year. Failure to meet these diversification requirements on the last day of a quarter may result in us having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC status. Any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices or times, and may cause us to incur substantial losses.\nIn addition, in order to be subject to tax as a RIC and to avoid corporate-level tax on the income and gains we distribute to our stockholders in respect of any tax year, we are required under the Code to distribute as dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution each tax year of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any. Additionally, in order to avoid the imposition of a U.S. federal excise tax, we are required to distribute, in respect of each calendar year, dividends to our stockholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of 98% of our calendar year net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections); 98.2% of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding calendar years that were not distributed during such calendar years and on which we previously paid no U.S. federal income tax. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become subject to corporate tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders. In addition, we could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions in order to re-qualify as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions.\nTo the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d DRIP for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out\u201d of our DRIP. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, stockholders participating in our DRIP will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes. If our common stock is trading above net asset value, a stockholder receiving distributions in the form of additional shares of our common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution of an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares of our common stock. We may use newly issued shares to implement the DRIP, or we may purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under the DRIP.\nRelated party transactions\nWe have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Advisor. The Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our investment activities are managed by the Advisor and supervised by the Board, the majority of whom are independent directors. Under the Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Advisor a base management fee as well as an incentive fee. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid the Advisor $6.9 million, $7.9 million and $6.4 million, respectively, pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement.\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Advisor is 60% owned by HTF Holdings LLC, which is 100% owned by Horizon Technology Finance, LLC. By virtue of their ownership interest in Horizon Technology Finance, LLC, our Chief Executive Officer, Robert D. Pomeroy, Jr. and our President, Gerald A. Michaud, may be deemed to control our Advisor.\nWe have also entered into the Administration Agreement with the Advisor. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Advisor for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Advisor in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement the Advisor provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid the Advisor $0.9 million, $1.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, pursuant to the Administration Agreement.\nThe predecessor of the Advisor has granted the Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Horizon Technology Finance.\u201d\nWe believe that we derive substantial benefits from our relationship with our Advisor. Our Advisor may manage other investment vehicles, or Advisor Funds, with the same investment strategy as us. The Advisor may provide us an opportunity to co-invest with the Advisor Funds. Under the 1940 Act, absent receipt of exemptive relief from the SEC, we and our affiliates are precluded from co-investing in such investments. On January 23, 2017, we filed an application for exemptive relief with the SEC which, if granted, would permit us to co-invest subject to certain conditions.\nCritical accounting policies\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nValuation of investments\nInvestments are recorded at fair value. Our Board determines the fair value of our portfolio investments. We apply fair value to substantially all of our investments in accordance with Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's, or FASB's, Accounting Standards Codification as amended, or ASC, which establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. We have categorized our investments carried at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the product is new, whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and the current market conditions. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. The three categories within the hierarchy are as follows:\nTable 233: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>Level 1 </td> <td>Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>Level 2 </td> <td>Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>Level 3 </td> <td>Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Board determines the fair value of investments in good faith, based on the input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our Board to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. The Board conducts this valuation process at the end of each fiscal quarter, with 25% (based on fair value) of our valuation of portfolio companies that do not have a readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm.\nIncome recognition\nInterest on debt investments is accrued and included in income based on contractual rates applied to principal amounts outstanding. Interest income is determined using a method that results in a level rate of return on principal amounts outstanding. Generally, when a debt investment becomes 90 days or more past due, or if we otherwise do not expect to receive interest and principal repayments, the debt investment is placed on non-accrual status and the recognition of interest income may be discontinued. Interest payments received on non-accrual debt investments may be recognized as income, on a cash basis, or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment at the time the debt investment is placed on non-accrual status. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not recognize interest income from debt investments on non-accrual status. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized as interest income interest payments of $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, received from one portfolio company whose debt investment was on non-accrual status.\nWe receive a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including advisory fees, commitment fees, amendment fees, non-utilization fees, success fees and prepayment fees. In a limited number of cases, we may also receive a non-refundable deposit earned upon the termination of a transaction. Debt investment origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred, and along with unearned income, are amortized as a level yield adjustment over the respective term of the debt investment. All other income is recorded into income when earned. Fees for counterparty debt investment commitments with multiple debt investments are allocated to each debt investment based upon each debt investment's relative fair value. When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual status, the amortization of the related fees and unearned income is discontinued until the debt investment is returned to accrual status.\nCertain debt investment agreements also require the borrower to make an ETP that is accrued into income over the life of the debt investment to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We will generally cease accruing the income if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the borrower to be able to pay all principal and interest due.\nIn connection with substantially all lending arrangements, we receive warrants to purchase shares of stock from the borrower. We record the warrants as assets at estimated fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We consider the warrants as loan fees and record them as unearned income on the grant date. The unearned income is recognized as interest income over the contractual life of the related debt investment in accordance with our income recognition policy. Subsequent to origination, the warrants are also measured at fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Any adjustment to fair value is recorded through earnings as net unrealized gain or loss on investments. Gains and losses from the disposition of the warrants or stock acquired from the exercise of warrants are recognized as realized gains and losses on investments.\nRealized gains or losses on the sale of investments, or upon the determination that an investment balance, or portion thereof, is not recoverable, are calculated using the specific identification method. We measure realized gains or losses by calculating the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized.\nIncome taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to qualify as a RIC and to avoid corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on the income distributed to stockholders, among other things, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, and we must timely distribute dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, for each tax year. We, among other things, have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal income taxes.\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions, we will accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, as modified by ASC Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, or uncertain tax positions, are recorded as a tax expense in the current year. It is our policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. We had no material uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncement\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, or ASU 2015-03, as clarified by ASU 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, or ASU 2015-15, containing guidance that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, instead of being recorded as a separate asset. ASU 2015-15 allows an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortize these deferred costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. We have adopted ASU 2015-03, as clarified by ASU 2015-15, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements other than corresponding reductions to total assets and total liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Prior to adoption, we recorded debt issuance costs in other assets as an asset on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Upon adoption, we reclassified these costs as unamortized debt issuance costs that reduce borrowings in the liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and retrospectively reclassified the debt issuance costs that were previously presented in other assets as an asset as of December 31, 2015.", "summary": "- Table 196 presents data on the investment portfolio of a debt

Our investment objective is to maximize our investment portfolio's total return by generating current income from the debt investments we make and capital appreciation from the warrants we receive when making such debt investments. We are focused on making Venture Loans to venture capital backed companies in our Target Industries, which we refer to as Venture Lending.\u201d We also selectively provide Venture Loans to publicly traded companies in our Target Industries. Our debt investments are typically secured by first liens or first liens behind a secured revolving line of credit, or Senior Term Loans. As of December 31, 2016, 97.4%, or $181.4 million, of our debt investment portfolio at fair value consisted of Senior Term Loans. Venture Lending is typically characterized by (1) the making of a secured debt investment after a venture capital or equity investment in the portfolio company has been made, which investment provides a source of cash to fund the portfolio company's debt service obligations under the Venture Loan, (2) the senior priority of the Venture Loan which requires repayment of the Venture Loan prior to the equity investors realizing a return on their capital, (3) the relatively rapid amortization of the Venture Loan and (4) the lender's receipt of warrants or other success fees with the making of the Venture Loan.\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowing. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. As a RIC, we generally are not subject to corporate-level income taxes on our investment company taxable income and our net capital gain that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders as long as we meet certain source-of-income, distribution, asset diversification and other requirements.\nCompass Horizon, our predecessor company, commenced operations in March 2008. We were formed in March 2010 for the purpose of acquiring Compass Horizon and continuing its business as a public entity.\nOur investment activities, and our day-to-day operations, are managed by our Advisor and supervised by our Board, of which a majority of the members are independent of us. Under the Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Advisor a base management fee and an incentive fee for its advisory services to us. We have also entered into the Administration Agreement with our Advisor under which we have agreed to reimburse our Advisor for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our Advisor in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.\nPortfolio composition and investment activity\nThe following table shows our portfolio by type of investment as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\n 58 \nThe following table shows total portfolio investment activity as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nWe receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nThe following table shows our debt investments by industry sector as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nThe largest debt investments in our portfolio may vary from year to year as new debt investments are originated and existing debt investments are repaid. Our five largest debt investments represented 24% and 21% of total debt investments outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No single debt investment represented more than 10% of our total debt investments as of December 31, 2016 or 2015.\n 59 \nDebt investment asset quality\nWe use an internal credit rating system which rates each debt investment on a scale of 4 to 1, with 4 being the highest credit quality rating and 3 being the rating for a standard level of risk. A rating of 2 represents an increased level of risk and, while no loss is currently anticipated for a 2-rated debt investment, there is potential for future loss of principal. A rating of 1 represents a deteriorating credit quality and a high degree of risk of loss of principal. Our internal credit rating system is not a national credit rating system. See Item 1 - Business\u201d for a more detailed description of the internal credit rating system. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our debt investments had a weighted average credit rating of 3.0. The following table shows the classification of our debt investment portfolio by credit rating as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were four debt investments with an internal credit rating of 1, with a cost of $26.2 million and a fair value of $11.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, there was one debt investment with an internal credit rating of 1, with an aggregate cost of $2.7 million and an aggregate fair value of $0.5 million.\nConsolidated results of operations\nAs a BDC and a RIC, we are subject to certain constraints on our operations, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. The consolidated results of operations described below may not be indicative of the results we report in future periods.\nThe following table shows consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments. As a result, annual comparisons of net increase in net assets resulting from operations may not be meaningful.\n 60 \nInvestment income\nTotal investment income increased by $1.9 million, or 6.0%, to $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, total investment income consisted primarily of $31.4 million in interest income from investments, which included $8.3 million in income from the accretion of origination fees and ETPs and $1.6 million in fee income. Interest income on investments increased by $2.7 million, or 9.6%, to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income on investments increased primarily due to the larger amount of ETPs earned during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Fee income, which includes success fee and prepayment fee income on debt investments, decreased by $0.9 million, or 35.5%, primarily due to a lower average prepayment fee rate earned during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, along with a lower amount of success fees earned during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal investment income remained flat at $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, total investment income consisted primarily of $28.7 million in interest income from investments, which included $4.5 million in income from the accretion of origination fees and ETPs, and $2.5 million in fee income. Interest income on investments remained flat at $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest income on investments remained flat due to an increase in the average size of our investment portfolio of $15.0 million, or 7.3%, which was offset by lower acceleration of fees and ETPs from prepayments. Fee income, which includes prepayment fee income and fee income on debt investments, decreased by $0.2 million, or 6.0%, primarily due to a lower aggregate amount of principal prepayments for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments was 14.9%, 14.2% and 15.3%, respectively. We calculate the yield on dollar-weighted average debt investments for any period measured as (1) total investment income during the period divided by (2) the average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield represents the portfolio yield and will be higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by investors.\nInvestment income, consisting of interest income and fees on debt investments, can fluctuate significantly upon repayment of large debt investments. Interest income from the five largest debt investments in the aggregate accounted for 17%, 14% and 20% of investment income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nExpenses\nTotal net expenses decreased by $1.1 million, or 6.7%, to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Total net expenses decreased by $3.3 million, or 16.0%, to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Total expenses for each period consisted of interest expense, base management fee, incentive and administrative fees, professional fees and general and administrative expenses.\nInterest expense increased by $0.1 million, or 2.1%, to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense, which includes the amortization of debt issuance costs, increased primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of $14.9 million, or 16.9%, which was partially offset by a decrease in our effective cost of debt for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense decreased by $3.0 million, or 33.9%, to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in average borrowings of $14.8 million, or 14.4%, along with a decrease in our effective cost of debt for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nBase management fee expense increased by $0.3 million, or 7.4%, to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, after giving effect to waivers of $0.3 million in base management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015. Base management fee increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to the waiver of base management fees of $0.3 million in 2015 in connection with the 2015 Offering, as described below. Base management fee expense, net of waivers, remained flat at $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Base management fee expense remained flat primarily due to our Advisor's waiver of base management fees of $0.3 million relating to the 2015 Offering, as described below, offset by an increase in our average gross assets of $6.4 million, or 2.6%.\n 61 \nAs noted above, our Advisor agreed to waive its base management fee relating to the proceeds raised in the 2015 Offering, to the extent such fee was not otherwise waived and regardless of the application of the proceeds raised, until the earlier to occur of (i) March 31, 2016 or (ii) the last day of the second consecutive calendar quarter in which our net investment income exceeds distributions declared on shares of our common stock for the applicable quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our Advisor waived $0.3 million of base management fees. As of December 31, 2015, condition (ii) above had been met, as our net investment income exceeded distributions declared for the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015.\nPerformance based incentive fee expense decreased by $1.4 million, or 39.3%, to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Performance based incentive fee expense decreased because the incentive fee expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016 was limited by the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism under our Investment Management Agreement. This resulted in $1.7 million of reduced expense and additional net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was subject to the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism due to net realized and unrealized losses in the portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaling $22.0 million. Performance based incentive fee expense, net of waivers, increased by $1.5 million, or 74.6%, to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Performance based incentive fee expense increased primarily due to higher Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAdministrative fee expense decreased by $0.3 million, or 22.7%, to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Administrative fee expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in our allocated costs of compensation incurred by the Advisor on our behalf for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Administrative fee expense remained flat at $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn 2016 and 2015, we elected to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company elected to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions of $1.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016, excise tax payable of $0.1 million was recorded. At December 31, 2015, no excise tax payable was recorded.\nProfessional fees and general and administrative expenses primarily include legal and audit fees and insurance premiums. These expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were unchanged at $2.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $1.8 million, or 43.7%, to $2.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to decreased legal fees and other costs associated with certain non-accrual investments and other assets.\nNet realized gains and losses and net unrealized appreciation and depreciation\nRealized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains or losses on investments include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized net losses totaling $7.8 million primarily due to the resolution of three debt investments. One debt investment was settled for net cash proceeds of $3.6 million, which resulted in a realized loss of $4.5 million and unrealized appreciation of $4.6 million. One debt investment was settled for net cash proceeds of $0.2 million and a royalty and sale agreement fair valued at $0.4 million, which resulted in a realized loss of $2.2 million and unrealized appreciation of $2.2 million. One debt investment was settled for cash proceeds which resulted in a realized loss of $0.9 million and unrealized appreciation of $0.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we realized net losses totaling $1.7 million primarily due to the resolution of one debt investment partially offset by realized gains on the sale of equity received upon the exercise of warrants. The debt investment was settled for a net cash payment of $4.9 million, which resulted in a realized loss of $1.8 million and unrealized appreciation of $1.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized net losses totaling $3.6 million primarily due to the resolution of three debt investments which were partially offset by realized gains on the sale of equity received upon the exercise of warrants. As a result of the resolution of the three debt investments, we recognized $5.0 million of realized net losses and $7.6 million of unrealized appreciation.\n 62 \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled $14.2 million which was primarily due to the unrealized depreciation on three debt investments offset by the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on one debt investment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled $0.5 million which was primarily due to the unrealized depreciation on one debt investment offset by the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on one debt investment that was settled during the period, described above. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net unrealized appreciation on investments totaled $8.3 million which was primarily due to the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on four debt investments.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and investments in money market funds of $37.1 million and $21.1 million, respectively. Cash and investments in money market funds are available to fund new investments, reduce borrowings, pay expenses, repurchase common stock and pay distributions. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had $1.1 million of restricted investments in money market funds. Restricted investments in money market funds were primarily used to make monthly interest and principal payments on our Asset-Backed Notes. Our primary sources of capital have been from our public and private equity offerings, use of our revolving credit facilities and issuance of our 2019 Notes and the Asset-Backed Notes.\nOn March 24, 2015, we completed a public offering of 2.0 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $26.5 million, after deducting underwriting commission and discounts and other offering expenses. We generally used the net proceeds from this offering to make investments, to repurchase or pay down liabilities and for general corporate purposes.\nOn July 29, 2016, our Board extended a previously authorized stock repurchase program which allows us to repurchase up to $5.0 million of our common stock at prices below our net asset value per share as reported in our most recent consolidated financial statements. Under the repurchase program, we may, but are not obligated to, repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time. Any repurchases by us will comply with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act and any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Unless extended by our Board, the repurchase program will terminate on the earlier of June 30, 2017 or the repurchase of $5.0 million of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 48,160 shares of our common stock at an average price of $10.66 on the open market for a total cost of $0.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 113,382 shares of our common stock at an average price of $11.53 on the open market for a total cost of $1.3 million. From the inception of the stock repurchase program through December 31, 2016, we repurchased 161,542 shares of our common stock at an average price of $11.27 on the open market at a total cost of $1.8 million.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, the outstanding principal balance under the Key Facility was $63.0 million and $68.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had borrowing capacity under the Key Facility of $32.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, $4.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, was available, subject to existing terms and advance rates.\nOur operating activities provided cash of $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our financing activities used cash of $35.9 million for the same period. Our operating activities provided cash primarily from principal payments received on our debt investments, partially offset by investments made in portfolio companies. Our financing activities used cash primarily to pay off our Asset-Backed Notes and pay distributions to our stockholders.\nOur operating activities used cash of $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our financing activities provided cash of $43.7 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for investments made in portfolio companies, partially offset by principal payments received on our debt investments. Our financing activities provided cash primarily from the 2015 Offering and advances on our Key Facility of $58.0 million, which was partially offset by cash used to pay down our Asset-Backed Notes, pay distributions to our stockholders and repurchase common stock under the stock repurchase program.\n 63 \nOur operating activities provided cash of $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our financing activities used cash of $53.6 million for the same period. Our operating activities provided cash primarily from principal payments received on debt investments, partially offset by investments made in portfolio companies. Our financing activities used cash primarily to pay down borrowings and pay distributions to our stockholders.\nOur primary use of available funds is to make debt investments in portfolio companies and for general corporate purposes. We expect to raise additional equity and debt capital opportunistically as needed, and subject to market conditions, to support our future growth to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.\nIn order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we intend to distribute to our stockholders all or substantially all of our investment company taxable income. In addition, as a BDC, we are required to maintain asset coverage of at least 200%. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash generated from operations, and funds available from our Key Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure commitments for at least the next 12 months.\nCurrent borrowings\nThe following table shows our borrowings as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nOn August 12, 2015, we amended the Key Facility to (1) add a $20 million commitment to the existing $50 million commitment and (2) extend the term of the Key Facility. On April 27, 2016, we further added a $25 million commitment to our existing $70 million commitment. The interest rate on the Key Facility is based upon the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a spread of 3.25%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. The LIBOR rate was 0.77% and 0.43% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The interest rate in effect was 4.00% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nThe Key Facility has an accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total loan commitment to $150 million. The Key Facility is collateralized by debt investments held by Credit II and permits an advance rate of up to fifty percent (50%) of eligible debt investments held by Credit II. The Key Facility contains covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum net worth, to restrict the debt investments securing the Key Facility to certain criteria for qualified debt investments and to comply with portfolio company concentration limits as defined in the related loan agreement. We may request advances under the Key Facility through August 12, 2018, or the Revolving Period. After the Revolving Period, we may not request new advances, and we must repay the outstanding advances under the Key Facility as of such date, at such times and in such amounts as are necessary to maintain compliance with the terms and conditions of the Key Facility, particularly the condition that the principal balance of the Key Facility not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate principal balance of our eligible debt investments to our portfolio companies. All outstanding advances under the Key Facility are due and payable on August 12, 2020.\nOn March 23, 2012, we issued and sold an aggregate principal amount of $30 million 2019 Notes, and on April 18, 2012, pursuant to the underwriters' 30-day option to purchase additional notes, we sold an additional $3 million of the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes will mature on March 15, 2019 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time or from time to time at a redemption price of $25 per security plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2019 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.375% per year payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes are our direct, unsecured obligations and (1) rank equally in right of payment with our future unsecured indebtedness; (2) are senior in right of payment to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2019 Notes; (3) are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and (4) are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, we were in material compliance with the terms of the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes are listed on the NYSE under the symbol HTF\u201d.\n 64 \nWe, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Horizon Credit III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, entered into a term loan credit facility, or the Term Loan Facility, with Fortress Credit Co LLC on August 23, 2012. The interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was based upon the one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 6.00%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00% and provided for a four-year drawing period. The Term Loan Facility contained customary covenants for a facility of its type. Effective June 17, 2014, we terminated the Term Loan Facility and a related loan and security agreement and other documents.\nOn June 28, 2013, we completed the 2013-1 Securitization. In connection with the 2013-1 Securitization, 2013-1 Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, issued $90 million in the Asset-Backed Notes, which were rated A1(sf) by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. The Asset-Backed Notes were issued by 2013-1 Trust and were backed by a pool of loans made to certain portfolio companies of ours and secured by certain assets of such portfolio companies. The Asset-Backed Notes were secured obligations of 2013-1 Trust and non-recourse to us. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Asset-Backed Notes, we made customary representations, warranties and covenants. The Asset-Backed Notes bore interest at a fixed rate of 3.00% per annum and had a stated maturity of May 15, 2018. As of December 31, 2016, the Asset-Backed Notes were repaid in full.\nUnder the terms of the Asset-Backed Notes, we were required to maintain a reserve cash balance, funded through principal collections from the underlying securitized debt portfolio, which could have been used to make monthly interest and principal payments on the Asset-Backed Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, other assets were $2.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, which is primarily comprised of debt issuance costs and prepaid expenses.\nContractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements\nThe following table shows our significant contractual payment obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016:\n\nIn the normal course of business, we are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These consist primarily of unfunded commitments to extend credit, in the form of loans, to our portfolio companies. Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our balance sheet. Our unfunded commitments may be significant from time to time. As of December 31, 2016, we had unfunded commitments of $20.8 million. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance requirements as are the financial instruments that we hold on our balance sheet. In addition, these commitments are often subject to financial or non-financial milestones and other conditions to borrowing that must be achieved before the commitment can be drawn. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We regularly monitor our unfunded commitments and anticipated refinancings, maturities and capital raising, to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to fund such unfunded commitments. As of December 31, 2016, we reasonably believed that our assets would provide adequate financial resources to satisfy all of our unfunded commitments.\nIn addition to the Key Facility, we have certain commitments pursuant to our Investment Management Agreement entered into with our Advisor. We have agreed to pay a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components (1) a base management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets less cash or cash equivalents, and (2) a two-part incentive fee. We have also entered into a contract with our Advisor to serve as our administrator. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of our Advisor's overhead in performing its obligations under the agreement, including rent, fees and other expenses inclusive of our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our Investment Management Agreement and our Administration Agreement.\n 65 \nDistributions\nIn order to qualify and be subject to tax as a RIC, we must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. Generally, in order to qualify as a RIC, we must derive at least 90% of our gross income for each tax year from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in stock or other securities. We must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of each tax year. Failure to meet these diversification requirements on the last day of a quarter may result in us having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC status. Any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices or times, and may cause us to incur substantial losses.\nIn addition, in order to be subject to tax as a RIC and to avoid corporate-level tax on the income and gains we distribute to our stockholders in respect of any tax year, we are required under the Code to distribute as dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution each tax year of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any. Additionally, in order to avoid the imposition of a U.S. federal excise tax, we are required to distribute, in respect of each calendar year, dividends to our stockholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of 98% of our calendar year net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections); 98.2% of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding calendar years that were not distributed during such calendar years and on which we previously paid no U.S. federal income tax. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become subject to corporate tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders. In addition, we could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions in order to re-qualify as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions.\nTo the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d DRIP for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out\u201d of our DRIP. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, stockholders participating in our DRIP will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes. If our common stock is trading above net asset value, a stockholder receiving distributions in the form of additional shares of our common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution of an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares of our common stock. We may use newly issued shares to implement the DRIP, or we may purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under the DRIP.\nRelated party transactions\nWe have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Advisor. The Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our investment activities are managed by the Advisor and supervised by the Board, the majority of whom are independent directors. Under the Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Advisor a base management fee as well as an incentive fee. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid the Advisor $6.9 million, $7.9 million and $6.4 million, respectively, pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement.\n 66 \nOur Advisor is 60% owned by HTF Holdings LLC, which is 100% owned by Horizon Technology Finance, LLC. By virtue of their ownership interest in Horizon Technology Finance, LLC, our Chief Executive Officer, Robert D. Pomeroy, Jr. and our President, Gerald A. Michaud, may be deemed to control our Advisor.\nWe have also entered into the Administration Agreement with the Advisor. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Advisor for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Advisor in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement the Advisor provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid the Advisor $0.9 million, $1.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, pursuant to the Administration Agreement.\nThe predecessor of the Advisor has granted the Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Horizon Technology Finance.\u201d\nWe believe that we derive substantial benefits from our relationship with our Advisor. Our Advisor may manage other investment vehicles, or Advisor Funds, with the same investment strategy as us. The Advisor may provide us an opportunity to co-invest with the Advisor Funds. Under the 1940 Act, absent receipt of exemptive relief from the SEC, we and our affiliates are precluded from co-investing in such investments. On January 23, 2017, we filed an application for exemptive relief with the SEC which, if granted, would permit us to co-invest subject to certain conditions.\nCritical accounting policies\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nValuation of investments\nInvestments are recorded at fair value. Our Board determines the fair value of our portfolio investments. We apply fair value to substantially all of our investments in accordance with Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's, or FASB's, Accounting Standards Codification as amended, or ASC, which establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. We have categorized our investments carried at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nForward-looking statements\nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. The forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to:\n \u2022 our future operating results, including the performance of our existing debt investments and warrants; \n \u2022 the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; \n \u2022 changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in the value of our assets; \n \u2022 the relative and absolute investment performance and operations of our Advisor; \n \u2022 the impact of increased competition; \n \u2022 the impact of investments we intend to make and future acquisitions and divestitures; \n \u2022 the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; \n \u2022 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; \n \u2022 the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property protection; \n \u2022 our regulatory structure and tax status; \n \u2022 our ability to qualify and maintain qualification as a RIC and as a BDC; \n \u2022 the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; \n \u2022 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; \n \u2022 the impact of interest rate volatility on our results, particularly if we use leverage as part of our investment strategy; \n \u2022 the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objective; \n \u2022 the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to us or our Advisor; \n \u2022 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; \n \u2022 our ability to access capital and any future financings by us; \n \u2022 the ability of our Advisor to attract and retain highly talented professionals; and \n \u2022 the impact of changes to tax legislation and, generally, our tax position. \nWe use words such as anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d seeks\u201d and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Undue influence should not be placed on the forward looking statements as our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors in Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in our annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe have based the forward-looking statements included in this report on information available to us on the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in this annual report on Form 10-K, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nYou should understand that under Sections 27A(b)(2)(B) and (D) of the Securities Act and Sections 21E(b)(2)(B) and (D) of the Exchange Act, the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to statements made in connection with this annual report on Form 10-K or any periodic reports we file under the Exchange Act.\n 57 \nOverview\nWe are a specialty finance company that lends to and invests in development-stage companies in our Target Industries. Our investment objective is to maximize our investment portfolio's total return by generating current income from the debt investments we make and capital appreciation from the warrants we receive when making such debt investments. We are focused on making Venture Loans to venture capital backed companies in our Target Industries, which we refer to as Venture Lending.\u201d We also selectively provide Venture Loans to publicly traded companies in our Target Industries. Our debt investments are typically secured by first liens or first liens behind a secured revolving line of credit, or Senior Term Loans. As of December 31, 2016, 97.4%, or $181.4 million, of our debt investment portfolio at fair value consisted of Senior Term Loans. Venture Lending is typically characterized by (1) the making of a secured debt investment after a venture capital or equity investment in the portfolio company has been made, which investment provides a source of cash to fund the portfolio company's debt service obligations under the Venture Loan, (2) the senior priority of the Venture Loan which requires repayment of the Venture Loan prior to the equity investors realizing a return on their capital, (3) the relatively rapid amortization of the Venture Loan and (4) the lender's receipt of warrants or other success fees with the making of the Venture Loan.\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowing. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. As a RIC, we generally are not subject to corporate-level income taxes on our investment company taxable income and our net capital gain that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders as long as we meet certain source-of-income, distribution, asset diversification and other requirements.\nCompass Horizon, our predecessor company, commenced operations in March 2008. We were formed in March 2010 for the purpose of acquiring Compass Horizon and continuing its business as a public entity.\nOur investment activities, and our day-to-day operations, are managed by our Advisor and supervised by our Board, of which a majority of the members are independent of us. Under the Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Advisor a base management fee and an incentive fee for its advisory services to us. We have also entered into the Administration Agreement with our Advisor under which we have agreed to reimburse our Advisor for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our Advisor in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.\nPortfolio composition and investment activity\nThe following table shows our portfolio by type of investment as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nInvestments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nof Total\nPortfolio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nInvestments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nof Total\nPortfolio\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Term loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>242,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Warrants </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 58 \nThe following table shows total portfolio investment activity as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Beginning portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>205,101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>New debt investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,281 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Principal payments received on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,403 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,016 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Early pay-offs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46,357 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,624 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accretion of debt investment fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>New debt investment fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(931 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,147 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>New equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sale of investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(984 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,669 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net realized loss on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,696 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,620 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net depreciation on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,397 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(490 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ending portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,267 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances.

Our five largest debt investments represented 24% and 21% of total debt investments outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No single debt investment represented more than 10% of our total debt investments as of December 31, 2016 or 2015.\n 59 \nDebt investment asset quality\nWe use an internal credit rating system which rates each debt investment on a scale of 4 to 1, with 4 being the highest credit quality rating and 3 being the rating for a standard level of risk. A rating of 2 represents an increased level of risk and, while no loss is currently anticipated for a 2-rated debt investment, there is potential for future loss of principal. A rating of 1 represents a deteriorating credit quality and a high degree of risk of loss of principal. Our internal credit rating system is not a national credit rating system. See Item 1 - Business\u201d for a more detailed description of the internal credit rating system. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our debt investments had a weighted average credit rating of 3.0.

The consolidated results of operations described below may not be indicative of the results we report in future periods.\nThe following table shows consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,984 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,254 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,377 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net investment income before excise tax </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,877 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Credit) provision for excise tax </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,717 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net realized loss on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,776 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,650 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,576 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,236 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(490 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,289 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (decrease) increase in net assets resulting from operations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,913 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,430 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average debt investments, at fair value </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>221,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>219,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>204,862 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average borrowings outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,976 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,754 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments. As a result, annual comparisons of net increase in net assets resulting from operations may not be meaningful.\n 60 \nInvestment income\nTotal investment income increased by $1.9 million, or 6.0%, to $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, total investment income consisted primarily of $31.4 million in interest income from investments, which included $8.3 million in income from the accretion of origination fees and ETPs and $1.6 million in fee income. Interest income on investments increased by $2.7 million, or 9.6%, to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income on investments increased primarily due to the larger amount of ETPs earned during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Fee income, which includes success fee and prepayment fee income on debt investments, decreased by $0.9 million, or 35.5%, primarily due to a lower average prepayment fee rate earned during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, along with a lower amount of success fees earned during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal investment income remained flat at $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, total investment income consisted primarily of $28.7 million in interest income from investments, which included $4.5 million in income from the accretion of origination fees and ETPs, and $2.5 million in fee income. Interest income on investments remained flat at $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest income on investments remained flat due to an increase in the average size of our investment portfolio of $15.0 million, or 7.3%, which was offset by lower acceleration of fees and ETPs from prepayments. Fee income, which includes prepayment fee income and fee income on debt investments, decreased by $0.2 million, or 6.0%, primarily due to a lower aggregate amount of principal prepayments for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments was 14.9%, 14.2% and 15.3%, respectively. We calculate the yield on dollar-weighted average debt investments for any period measured as (1) total investment income during the period divided by (2) the average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield represents the portfolio yield and will be higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by investors.\nInvestment income, consisting of interest income and fees on debt investments, can fluctuate significantly upon repayment of large debt investments. Interest income from the five largest debt investments in the aggregate accounted for 17%, 14% and 20% of investment income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nExpenses\nTotal net expenses decreased by $1.1 million, or 6.7%, to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Total net expenses decreased by $3.3 million, or 16.0%, to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Total expenses for each period consisted of interest expense, base management fee, incentive and administrative fees, professional fees and general and administrative expenses.\nInterest expense increased by $0.1 million, or 2.1%, to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense, which includes the amortization of debt issuance costs, increased primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of $14.9 million, or 16.9%, which was partially offset by a decrease in our effective cost of debt for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense decreased by $3.0 million, or 33.9%, to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in average borrowings of $14.8 million, or 14.4%, along with a decrease in our effective cost of debt for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nBase management fee expense increased by $0.3 million, or 7.4%, to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, after giving effect to waivers of $0.3 million in base management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015. Base management fee increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to the waiver of base management fees of $0.3 million in 2015 in connection with the 2015 Offering, as described below. Base management fee expense, net of waivers, remained flat at $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Base management fee expense remained flat primarily due to our Advisor's waiver of base management fees of $0.3 million relating to the 2015 Offering, as described below, offset by an increase in our average gross assets of $6.4 million, or 2.6%.\n 61 \nAs noted above, our Advisor agreed to waive its base management fee relating to the proceeds raised in the 2015 Offering, to the extent such fee was not otherwise waived and regardless of the application of the proceeds raised, until the earlier to occur of (i) March 31, 2016 or (ii) the last day of the second consecutive calendar quarter in which our net investment income exceeds distributions declared on shares of our common stock for the applicable quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our Advisor waived $0.3 million of base management fees. As of December 31, 2015, condition (ii) above had been met, as our net investment income exceeded distributions declared for the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015.\nPerformance based incentive fee expense decreased by $1.4 million, or 39.3%, to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Performance based incentive fee expense decreased because the incentive fee expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016 was limited by the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism under our Investment Management Agreement. This resulted in $1.7 million of reduced expense and additional net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was subject to the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism due to net realized and unrealized losses in the portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaling $22.0 million. Performance based incentive fee expense, net of waivers, increased by $1.5 million, or 74.6%, to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Performance based incentive fee expense increased primarily due to higher Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAdministrative fee expense decreased by $0.3 million, or 22.7%, to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Administrative fee expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in our allocated costs of compensation incurred by the Advisor on our behalf for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Administrative fee expense remained flat at $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn 2016 and 2015, we elected to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company elected to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions of $1.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016, excise tax payable of $0.1 million was recorded. At December 31, 2015, no excise tax payable was recorded.\nProfessional fees and general and administrative expenses primarily include legal and audit fees and insurance premiums. These expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were unchanged at $2.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $1.8 million, or 43.7%, to $2.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to decreased legal fees and other costs associated with certain non-accrual investments and other assets.\nNet realized gains and losses and net unrealized appreciation and depreciation\nRealized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains or losses on investments include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized net losses totaling $7.8 million primarily due to the resolution of three debt investments. One debt investment was settled for net cash proceeds of $3.6 million, which resulted in a realized loss of $4.5 million and unrealized appreciation of $4.6 million. One debt investment was settled for net cash proceeds of $0.2 million and a royalty and sale agreement fair valued at $0.4 million, which resulted in a realized loss of $2.2 million and unrealized appreciation of $2.2 million. One debt investment was settled for cash proceeds which resulted in a realized loss of $0.9 million and unrealized appreciation of $0.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we realized net losses totaling $1.7 million primarily due to the resolution of one debt investment partially offset by realized gains on the sale of equity received upon the exercise of warrants. The debt investment was settled for a net cash payment of $4.9 million, which resulted in a realized loss of $1.8 million and unrealized appreciation of $1.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized net losses totaling $3.6 million primarily due to the resolution of three debt investments which were partially offset by realized gains on the sale of equity received upon the exercise of warrants. As a result of the resolution of the three debt investments, we recognized $5.0 million of realized net losses and $7.6 million of unrealized appreciation.\n 62 \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled $14.2 million which was primarily due to the unrealized depreciation on three debt investments offset by the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on one debt investment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled $0.5 million which was primarily due to the unrealized depreciation on one debt investment offset by the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on one debt investment that was settled during the period, described above. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net unrealized appreciation on investments totaled $8.3 million which was primarily due to the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on four debt investments.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and investments in money market funds of $37.1 million and $21.1 million, respectively. Cash and investments in money market funds are available to fund new investments, reduce borrowings, pay expenses, repurchase common stock and pay distributions. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had $1.1 million of restricted investments in money market funds. Restricted investments in money market funds were primarily used to make monthly interest and principal payments on our Asset-Backed Notes. Our primary sources of capital have been from our public and private equity offerings, use of our revolving credit facilities and issuance of our 2019 Notes and the Asset-Backed Notes.\nOn March 24, 2015, we completed a public offering of 2.0 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $26.5 million, after deducting underwriting commission and discounts and other offering expenses. We generally used the net proceeds from this offering to make investments, to repurchase or pay down liabilities and for general corporate purposes.\nOn July 29, 2016, our Board extended a previously authorized stock repurchase program which allows us to repurchase up to $5.0 million of our common stock at prices below our net asset value per share as reported in our most recent consolidated financial statements. Under the repurchase program, we may, but are not obligated to, repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time. Any repurchases by us will comply with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act and any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Unless extended by our Board, the repurchase program will terminate on the earlier of June 30, 2017 or the repurchase of $5.0 million of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 48,160 shares of our common stock at an average price of $10.66 on the open market for a total cost of $0.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 113,382 shares of our common stock at an average price of $11.53 on the open market for a total cost of $1.3 million. From the inception of the stock repurchase program through December 31, 2016, we repurchased 161,542 shares of our common stock at an average price of $11.27 on the open market at a total cost of $1.8 million.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, the outstanding principal balance under the Key Facility was $63.0 million and $68.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had borrowing capacity under the Key Facility of $32.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, $4.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, was available, subject to existing terms and advance rates.\nOur operating activities provided cash of $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our financing activities used cash of $35.9 million for the same period. Our operating activities provided cash primarily from principal payments received on our debt investments, partially offset by investments made in portfolio companies. Our financing activities used cash primarily to pay off our Asset-Backed Notes and pay distributions to our stockholders.\nOur operating activities used cash of $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our financing activities provided cash of $43.7 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for investments made in portfolio companies, partially offset by principal payments received on our debt investments. Our financing activities provided cash primarily from the 2015 Offering and advances on our Key Facility of $58.0 million, which was partially offset by cash used to pay down our Asset-Backed Notes, pay distributions to our stockholders and repurchase common stock under the stock repurchase program.\n 63 \nOur operating activities provided cash of $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our financing activities used cash of $53.6 million for the same period. Our operating activities provided cash primarily from principal payments received on debt investments, partially offset by investments made in portfolio companies. Our financing activities used cash primarily to pay down borrowings and pay distributions to our stockholders.\nOur primary use of available funds is to make debt investments in portfolio companies and for general corporate purposes. We expect to raise additional equity and debt capital opportunistically as needed, and subject to market conditions, to support our future growth to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.\nIn order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we intend to distribute to our stockholders all or substantially all of our investment company taxable income. In addition, as a BDC, we are required to maintain asset coverage of at least 200%. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash generated from operations, and funds available from our Key Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure commitments for at least the next 12 months.\nCurrent borrowings\nThe following table shows our borrowings as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nCommitment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance\nOutstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Unused\nCommitment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nCommitment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance\nOutstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Unused\nCommitment </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asset-Backed Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Key Facility </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 Notes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total before debt issuance costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unamortized debt issuance costs attributable to term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(403 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(592 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total borrowings outstanding, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>114,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 12, 2015, we amended the Key Facility to (1) add a $20 million commitment to the existing $50 million commitment and (2) extend the term of the Key Facility. On April 27, 2016, we further added a $25 million commitment to our existing $70 million commitment. The interest rate on the Key Facility is based upon the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a spread of 3.25%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. The LIBOR rate was 0.77% and 0.43% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The interest rate in effect was 4.00% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nThe Key Facility has an accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total loan commitment to $150 million. The Key Facility is collateralized by debt investments held by Credit II and permits an advance rate of up to fifty percent (50%) of eligible debt investments held by Credit II. The Key Facility contains covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum net worth, to restrict the debt investments securing the Key Facility to certain criteria for qualified debt investments and to comply with portfolio company concentration limits as defined in the related loan agreement. We may request advances under the Key Facility through August 12, 2018, or the Revolving Period. After the Revolving Period, we may not request new advances, and we must repay the outstanding advances under the Key Facility as of such date, at such times and in such amounts as are necessary to maintain compliance with the terms and conditions of the Key Facility, particularly the condition that the principal balance of the Key Facility not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate principal balance of our eligible debt investments to our portfolio companies. All outstanding advances under the Key Facility are due and payable on August 12, 2020.\nOn March 23, 2012, we issued and sold an aggregate principal amount of $30 million 2019 Notes, and on April 18, 2012, pursuant to the underwriters' 30-day option to purchase additional notes, we sold an additional $3 million of the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes will mature on March 15, 2019 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time or from time to time at a redemption price of $25 per security plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2019 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.375% per year payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes are our direct, unsecured obligations and (1) rank equally in right of payment with our future unsecured indebtedness; (2) are senior in right of payment to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2019 Notes; (3) are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and (4) are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, we were in material compliance with the terms of the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes are listed on the NYSE under the symbol HTF\u201d.\n 64 \nWe, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Horizon Credit III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, entered into a term loan credit facility, or the Term Loan Facility, with Fortress Credit Co LLC on August 23, 2012. The interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was based upon the one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 6.00%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00% and provided for a four-year drawing period. The Term Loan Facility contained customary covenants for a facility of its type. Effective June 17, 2014, we terminated the Term Loan Facility and a related loan and security agreement and other documents.\nOn June 28, 2013, we completed the 2013-1 Securitization. In connection with the 2013-1 Securitization, 2013-1 Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, issued $90 million in the Asset-Backed Notes, which were rated A1(sf) by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. The Asset-Backed Notes were issued by 2013-1 Trust and were backed by a pool of loans made to certain portfolio companies of ours and secured by certain assets of such portfolio companies. The Asset-Backed Notes were secured obligations of 2013-1 Trust and non-recourse to us. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Asset-Backed Notes, we made customary representations, warranties and covenants. The Asset-Backed Notes bore interest at a fixed rate of 3.00% per annum and had a stated maturity of May 15, 2018. As of December 31, 2016, the Asset-Backed Notes were repaid in full.\nUnder the terms of the Asset-Backed Notes, we were required to maintain a reserve cash balance, funded through principal collections from the underlying securitized debt portfolio, which could have been used to make monthly interest and principal payments on the Asset-Backed Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, other assets were $2.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, which is primarily comprised of debt issuance costs and prepaid expenses.\nContractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements\nThe following table shows our significant contractual payment obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unfunded commitments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the normal course of business, we are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These consist primarily of unfunded commitments to extend credit, in the form of loans, to our portfolio companies. Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our balance sheet. Our unfunded commitments may be significant from time to time. As of December 31, 2016, we had unfunded commitments of $20.8 million. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance requirements as are the financial instruments that we hold on our balance sheet. In addition, these commitments are often subject to financial or non-financial milestones and other conditions to borrowing that must be achieved before the commitment can be drawn. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We regularly monitor our unfunded commitments and anticipated refinancings, maturities and capital raising, to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to fund such unfunded commitments. As of December 31, 2016, we reasonably believed that our assets would provide adequate financial resources to satisfy all of our unfunded commitments.\nIn addition to the Key Facility, we have certain commitments pursuant to our Investment Management Agreement entered into with our Advisor. We have agreed to pay a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components (1) a base management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets less cash or cash equivalents, and (2) a two-part incentive fee. We have also entered into a contract with our Advisor to serve as our administrator. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of our Advisor's overhead in performing its obligations under the agreement, including rent, fees and other expenses inclusive of our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our Investment Management Agreement and our Administration Agreement.\n 65 \nDistributions\nIn order to qualify and be subject to tax as a RIC, we must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. Generally, in order to qualify as a RIC, we must derive at least 90% of our gross income for each tax year from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in stock or other securities. We must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of each tax year. Failure to meet these diversification requirements on the last day of a quarter may result in us having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC status. Any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices or times, and may cause us to incur substantial losses.\nIn addition, in order to be subject to tax as a RIC and to avoid corporate-level tax on the income and gains we distribute to our stockholders in respect of any tax year, we are required under the Code to distribute as dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution each tax year of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any. Additionally, in order to avoid the imposition of a U.S. federal excise tax, we are required to distribute, in respect of each calendar year, dividends to our stockholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of 98% of our calendar year net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections); 98.2% of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding calendar years that were not distributed during such calendar years and on which we previously paid no U.S. federal income tax. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become subject to corporate tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders. In addition, we could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions in order to re-qualify as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions.\nTo the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d DRIP for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out\u201d of our DRIP. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, stockholders participating in our DRIP will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes. If our common stock is trading above net asset value, a stockholder receiving distributions in the form of additional shares of our common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution of an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares of our common stock. We may use newly issued shares to implement the DRIP, or we may purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under the DRIP.\nRelated party transactions\nWe have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Advisor. The Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our investment activities are managed by the Advisor and supervised by the Board, the majority of whom are independent directors. Under the Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Advisor a base management fee as well as an incentive fee. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid the Advisor $6.9 million, $7.9 million and $6.4 million, respectively, pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement.\n 66 \nOur Advisor is 60% owned by HTF Holdings LLC, which is 100% owned by Horizon Technology Finance, LLC. By virtue of their ownership interest in Horizon Technology Finance, LLC, our Chief Executive Officer, Robert D. Pomeroy, Jr. and our President, Gerald A. Michaud, may be deemed to control our Advisor.\nWe have also entered into the Administration Agreement with the Advisor. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Advisor for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Advisor in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement the Advisor provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid the Advisor $0.9 million, $1.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, pursuant to the Administration Agreement.\nThe predecessor of the Advisor has granted the Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Horizon Technology Finance.\u201d\nWe believe that we derive substantial benefits from our relationship with our Advisor. Our Advisor may manage other investment vehicles, or Advisor Funds, with the same investment strategy as us. The Advisor may provide us an opportunity to co-invest with the Advisor Funds. Under the 1940 Act, absent receipt of exemptive relief from the SEC, we and our affiliates are precluded from co-investing in such investments. On January 23, 2017, we filed an application for exemptive relief with the SEC which, if granted, would permit us to co-invest subject to certain conditions.\nCritical accounting policies\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nValuation of investments\nInvestments are recorded at fair value. Our Board determines the fair value of our portfolio investments. We apply fair value to substantially all of our investments in accordance with Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's, or FASB's, Accounting Standards Codification as amended, or ASC, which establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. We have categorized our investments carried at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the"}
