The purpose of this discussion is to provide\ninformation about our financial\ncondition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the\nconsolidated financial statements. The\nfollowing discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes\nincluded elsewhere herein. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking\nstatements, so you should\nrefer to Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company was incorporated in 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware and became a bank\nholding company after\nit acquired its Alabama predecessor,\nwhich was a bank holding company established in 1984. The Bank, the Company's\nprincipal subsidiary, is an Alabama\nstate-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System and has operated\ncontinuously since 1907. Both the Company and the Bank are headquartered\nin Auburn, Alabama. The Bank conducts its\nbusiness primarily in East Alabama, including Lee County and surrounding areas.\nThe Bank operates full-service branches\nin Auburn, Opelika, Notasulga and Valley,\nAlabama.\nThe Bank also operates loan production offices in Auburn and\nPhenix City, Alabama.\nSummary of Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nNet interest income (a)\n$\n24,460\n$\n24,830\nLess: tax-equivalent adjustment\nNet interest income (GAAP)\n23,990\n24,338\nNoninterest income\n4,288\n5,375\nTotal revenue\n28,278\n29,713\nProvision for loan losses\n(600)\n1,100\nNoninterest expense\n19,433\n19,554\nIncome tax expense\n1,406\n1,605\nNet earnings\n$\n8,039\n$\n7,454\nBasic and diluted net earnings per share\n$\n2.27\n$\n2.09\n(a) Tax-equivalent.\nSee \"Table 1 - Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nFinancial Summary\nThe Company's net earnings were $8.0\nmillion for the full year 2021, compared to $7.5 million for the full year 2020.\nBasic and diluted net earnings per share were $2.27 per share for the full year 2021,\ncompared to $2.09 per share for the full\nyear 2020.\nNet interest income (tax-equivalent) was $24.5\nmillion in 2021, a 1% decrease compared to $24.8 million in 2020. This\ndecrease was primarily due to net interest margin compression\n,\npartially offset by balance sheet growth.\nNet interest\nmargin (tax-equivalent) decreased to 2.55% in 2021,\ncompared to 2.92% in 2020, primarily due to the lower interest rate\nenvironment and changes in our asset mix resulting from the significant increase\nin deposits from government stimulus and\nrelief programs and customers' increased savings.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company's allowance\nfor loan losses was $4.9 million, or 1.08% of total loans, compared to\n$5.6 million, or 1.22%\nof total loans, at December 31, 2020.\nExcluding\nPaycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) loans, which\nare guaranteed by the SBA,\nthe Company's allowance for loan losses\nwas 1.10% and 1.27% of total loans at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively\n.\nThe Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.6\nmillion in 2021 compared\nto a charge of $1.1 million during 2020.\nThe negative provision for loan losses was primarily related to improvements in\neconomic conditions in our primary market area, and related improvements in our\nasset quality.\nThe provision for loan\nlosses is based upon various estimates and judgements, including the absolute level\nof loans, loan growth, credit quality and\nthe amount of net charge-offs.\nNet charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 0.02% in 2021\n,\ncompared to net\nrecoveries as a percent of average loans of 0.03% in 2020.\nNoninterest income was $4.3 million in 2021 compared to $5.4\nmillion in 2020.\nThe decrease was primarily due to a $0.8\nmillion decrease in mortgage lending income in 2021 as refinance activity declined\nin our primary market area and a $0.3\nmillion non-taxable death benefit from bank-owned life insurance received\nin 2020.\nNoninterest expense was $19.4\nmillion in 2021 compared to $19.6\nmillion in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a\nreduction of $0.8\nmillion in various expenses related to the redevelopment of the Company's\nheadquarters in downtown\nAuburn.\nThis decrease was mostly offset by increases in salaries and benefits expe\nnse of $0.4 million and a $0.2 million\nincrease in FDIC and other regulatory assessments during 2021.\nIncome tax expense was $1.4\nmillion in 2021 and $1.6 million in 2020 reflecting an effective tax rate of 14.89\n%\nand\n17.72%, respectively.\nThis decrease was primarily due to an income tax benefit related to a New Markets Tax\nCredit\ninvestment funded in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe Company's effective income\ntax rate is principally impacted by tax-\nexempt earnings from the Company's investments\nin municipal securities, bank-owned life insurance, and New Markets\nTax Credits.\nThe Company paid cash dividends of $1.04\nper share in 2021, an increase of 2% from 2020. At December 31, 2021, the\nBank's regulatory capital ratios\nwere well above the minimum amounts required to be well capitalized\u201d under current\nregulatory standards with a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.06%,\na tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.35% and common equity tier\n1 ( CET1\u201d) of 16.23% at December 31, 2021.\nCOVID-19 Impact Assessment\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has occurred in waves of different\nvariants since the first quarter of 2020.\nVaccines\nto protect\nagainst and/or reduce the severity of COVID-19 were widely introduced at the beginning\nof 2021.\nAt times, the pandemic\nhas severely restricted the level of economic activity in our markets. In response to the COVID\n-19 pandemic, the State of\nAlabama, and most other states, have taken preventative or protective actions to prevent the\nspread of the virus, including\nimposing restrictions on travel and business operations and a statewide mask mandate,\nadvising or requiring individuals to\nlimit or forego their time outside of their homes, limitations on gathering of people and social distancing,\nand causing\ntemporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. Though certain\nof these measures have been\nrelaxed or eliminated, especially as vaccination levels increased, such\nmeasures could be reestablished in cases of new\nwaves, especially a wave of a COVID-19 variant that is more resistant\nto existing vaccines.\nCOVID-19 has significantly affected local state, national and global\nhealth and economic activity and its future effects are\nuncertain and will depend on various factors, including, among others, the duration\nand scope of the pandemic, especially\nnew variants of the virus, effective vaccines and drug treatments, together\nwith governmental, regulatory and private sector\nresponses. COVID-19 has had continuing significant effects\non the economy, financial\nmarkets and our employees,\ncustomers and vendors. Our business, financial condition and results of operations\ngenerally rely upon the ability of our\nborrowers to make deposits and repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our\nsecured loans, market value,\nstability and liquidity and demand for loans and other products and services we offer,\nall of which are affected by the\npandemic.\nWe have implemented\na number of procedures in response to the pandemic to support the safety and well-being of our\nemployees, customers and shareholders.\n\u2022\nWe believe our business continuity\nplan has worked to provide essential banking services to our communities and\ncustomers, while protecting our employees' health.\nAs part of our efforts to exercise social distancing in\naccordance with the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and the Governor\nof the State of Alabama,\nstarting March 23, 2020, we limited branch lobby service to appointment only while continuing\nto operate our\nbranch drive-thru facilities and ATMs.\nAs permitted by state public health guidelines, on June 1, 2020, we re-\nopened some of our branch lobbies.\nIn 2021, we opened our remaining branch lobbies.\nWe continue to provide\nservices through our online and other electronic channels.\nIn addition, we maintain remote work access to help\nemployees stay at home while providing continuity of service.\n\u2022\nWe are focused on servicing\nthe financial needs of our commercial and consumer clients with extensions\nand\ndeferrals to loan customers effected by COVID-19, provided\nsuch customers were not more than 30 days past due\nat the time of the request; and\n\u2022\nWe\nwere an active PPP lender. PPP loans were forgivable,\nin whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll\nand other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP.\nThese loans carry a fixed rate of\n1.00% and a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans\nmade on or after June 5,\n2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part.\nPayments are deferred until either the date on which the Small Business\nAdministration ( SBA\u201d) remits the amount of forgiveness proceeds\nto the lender or the date that is 10 months after\nthe last day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness\nwithin that 10-month period.\nWe\nbelieve these loans and our participation in the program helped our customers and the communities\nwe serve.\nCOVID-19 has also had various economic effects, generally.\nThese include supply chain disruptions and manufacturing\ndelays, shortages of certain goods and services, reduced consumer expenditure on\nhospitality and travel, and migration from\nlarger urban centers to less populated areas and remote work.\nThe demand for single family housing has exceeded existing\nsupplies.\nWhen coupled with construction delays attributable to supply chain disruptions\nand worker shortages, these\nfactors have caused housing prices and apartment rents to increase, generally.\nStimulative monetary and fiscal policy,\nalong with shortages of certain goods and services, and rising petroleum and food prices\nhave led to the highest inflation in\ndecades.\nAlthough fiscal stimulus remains under consideration by the President and Congress,\nthe Federal Reserve is\nconsidering increasing its target interest rates and reducing its holding of\nsecurities to stem inflation.\nA summary of PPP loans extended during 2020 follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n# of SBA\nApproved\nMix\n$ of SBA\nApproved\nMix\nSBA Tier:\n$2 million to $10 million\n-\n-\n%\n$\n-\n-\n%\n$350,000 to less than $2 million\n14,691\nUp to $350,000\n21,784\nTotal\n%\n$\n36,475\n%\nWe collected\napproximately $1.5 million in fees related to our PPP loans during 2020.\nThrough December 31, 2021, we\nhave recognized all of these fees, net of related costs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had received payments and\nforgiveness on all PPP loans extended during 2020.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits,\nand Venues\nAct (the Economic Aid\nAct\u201d) was signed into law. The\nEconomic Aid Act provides a second $900 billion stimulus package, including\n$325 billion\nin additional PPP loans.\nThe Economic Aid Act also permits the collection of a higher amount of PPP\nloan fees by\nparticipating banks.\nA summary of PPP loans extended during 2021 under the Economic Aid\nAct follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n# of SBA\nApproved\nMix\n$ of SBA\nApproved\nMix\nSBA Tier:\n$2 million to $10 million\n-\n-\n%\n$\n-\n-\n%\n$350,000 to less than $2 million\n6,494\nUp to $350,000\n13,757\nTotal\n%\n$\n20,251\n%\nWe collected\napproximately $1.0 million in fees related to PPP loans under the Economic Aid Act.\nThrough December 31,\n2021, we have recognized $0.7 million of these fees, net of related costs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have received\npayments and forgiveness on 116\nPPP loans under the Economic Aid Act, totaling $12.1 million.\nThe outstanding balance\nfor the remaining 138 PPP loans under the Economic Aid Act\nwas approximately $8.1 million at December 31, 2021.\nWe continue to closely\nmonitor this pandemic, and are working to continue our services during the pandemic\nand to address\ndevelopments as those occur.\nOur results of operations for year ended December 31, 2021, and our financial condition\nat\nthat date reflect only the ongoing effects of the pandemic, and\nmay not be indicative of future results or financial\nconditions, including possible changes in monetary or fiscal stimulus, and\nthe possible effects of the expiration or extension\nof temporary accounting and bank regulatory relief measures in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nAs of December 31, 2021,\nall of our capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements to be well capitalized.\nThe\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our borrowers could result in adverse changes\nto credit quality and our regulatory\ncapital ratios.\nWe continue to\nclosely monitor this pandemic, and are working to continue our services during the pandemic\nand to address developments as those occur.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples and with general practices within the banking industry.\nIn connection with the application of those principles, we\nhave made judgments and estimates which, in the case of the determination of our allowance\nfor loan losses, our\nassessment of other-than-temporary impairment, recurring and\nnon-recurring fair value measurements, the valuation of\nother real estate owned, and the valuation of deferred tax assets, were critical to the determination\nof our financial position\nand results of operations. Other policies also require subjective judgment and assumptions\nand may accordingly impact our\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company assesses the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses prior\nto the end of each calendar quarter. The level of\nthe allowance is based upon management's\nevaluation of the loan portfolio, past loan loss experience, current asset quality\ntrends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect\na borrower's ability to repay (including\nthe timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral,\ncomposition of the loan portfolio, economic\nconditions, industry and peer bank loan loss rates and other pertinent factors, including regulatory\nrecommendations. This\nevaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the\namounts and timing of future cash flows\nexpected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. Loans are\ncharged off, in whole or\nin part, when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely.\nA loan may be partially charged-off\nafter a confirming event\u201d has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant\nto the terms of the loan is\nunlikely.\nThe Company deems loans impaired when, based on current information and events, it is\nprobable that the Company will\nbe unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.\nCollection of all amounts due\naccording to the contractual terms means that both the interest and principal payments of a\nloan will be collected as\nscheduled in the loan agreement.\nAn impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded\ninvestment in the loan. The\nimpairment is recognized through the allowance. Loans that are impaired are\nrecorded at the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows discounted at the loan's effective\ninterest rate, or if the loan is collateral dependent, impairment\nmeasurement is based on the fair value of the collateral, less estimated disposal costs.\nThe level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate\nto absorb probable losses inherent in the\nportfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged\nto expense and decreased by charge-\noffs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off.\nIn assessing the adequacy of the allowance, the Company also considers the results of its\nongoing internal, independent\nloan review process. The Company's loan\nreview process assists in determining whether there are loans in the portfolio\nwhose credit quality has weakened over time and evaluating the risk characteristics of the\nentire loan portfolio. The\nCompany's loan review process includes the judgment\nof management, the input from our independent loan reviewers, and\nreviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination\nprocess. The Company\nincorporates loan review results in the determination of whether or not it is probable\nthat it will be able to collect all\namounts due according to the contractual terms of a loan.\nAs part of the Company's quarterly assessment\nof the allowance, management divides the loan portfolio into five segments:\ncommercial and industrial, construction and land development, commercial real estate, residential\nreal estate, and consumer\ninstallment loans. The Company\nanalyzes each segment and estimates an allowance allocation for each loan\nsegment.\nThe allocation of the allowance for loan losses begins with a process of estimating the\nprobable losses inherent for these\ntypes of loans. The estimates for these loans are established by category and based\non the Company's internal system of\ncredit risk ratings and historical loss data. The estimated loan loss allocation rate for the Company's\ninternal system of\ncredit risk grades is based on its experience with similarly graded loans. For\nloan segments where the Company believes it\ndoes not have sufficient historical loss data, the Company may\nmake adjustments based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank\ngroups. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, and for the years then ended, the Company adjusted\nits historical loss rates for the\ncommercial real estate portfolio segment based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank groups.\nThe estimated loan loss allocation for all five loan portfolio segments is then adjusted for management's\nestimate of\nprobable losses for several qualitative and environmental\u201d factors.\nThe allocation for qualitative and environmental\nfactors is particularly subjective and does not lend itself to exact mathematical calculation.\nThis amount represents\nestimated probable inherent credit losses which exist, but have not yet been identified, as of\nthe balance sheet date, and are\nbased upon quarterly trend assessments in delinquent and nonaccrual loans, credit\nconcentration changes, prevailing\neconomic conditions, changes in lending personnel experience, changes in lending\npolicies or procedures and other\ninfluencing factors.\nThese qualitative and environmental factors are considered for each of the five loan segments\nand the\nallowance allocation, as determined by the processes noted above, is increased or\ndecreased based on the incremental\nassessment of these factors.\nThe Company regularly re-evaluates its practices in determining the allowance\nfor loan losses. Since the fourth quarter of\n2016, the Company has increased its look-back period each quarter to incorporate\nthe effects of at least one economic\ndownturn in its loss history. The Company believes\nthe extension of its look-back period is appropriate due to the risks\ninherent in the loan portfolio. Absent this extension, the early cycle periods in\nwhich the Company experienced significant\nlosses would be excluded from the determination of the allowance for loan losses and its balance\nwould decrease. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, the Company increased its look-back period to\n51 quarters to continue to include losses\nincurred by the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2009. The Company\nwill likely continue to increase its look-\nback period to incorporate the effects of at least one economic downturn in\nits loss history. During 2020,\nthe Company\nadjusted certain qualitative and economic factors related to changes in economic conditions\ndriven by the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions, including\nhigher unemployment in our primary market\narea.\nDuring 2021, the Company adjusted certain qualitative and economic factors to reflect\nimprovements in economic\nconditions in our primary market area.\nFurther adjustments may be made in the future as a result of the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic.\nAssessment for Other-Than-Temporary\nImpairment of Securities\nOn a quarterly basis, management makes an assessment to determine\nwhether there have been events or economic\ncircumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is other-than-temporarily\nimpaired.\nFor debt securities with an unrealized loss, an other-than-temporary\nimpairment write-down is triggered when (1) the\nCompany has the intent to sell a debt security,\n(2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the\ndebt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) the Company does not expect\nto recover the entire amortized\ncost basis of the debt security.\nIf the Company has the intent to sell a debt security or if it is more likely than not that it\nwill\nbe required to sell the debt security before recovery,\nthe other-than-temporary write-down is equal to the entire difference\nbetween the debt security's amortized cost\nand its fair value.\nIf the Company does not intend to sell the security or it is not\nmore likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery,\nthe other-than-temporary impairment write-\ndown is separated into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due\nto all other factors.\nThe\ncredit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between\nthe security's amortized cost basis and\nthe\npresent value of its expected future cash flows.\nThe remaining difference between the security's\nfair value and the present\nvalue of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome, net of applicable taxes.\nThe Company is required to own certain stock as a condition of membership, such as\nFederal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d)\nand Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d).\nThese non-marketable equity securities are accounted for at cost\nwhich equals par or\nredemption value.\nThese securities do not have a readily determinable fair value as their ownership is restricted and\nthere is\nno market for these securities.\nThe Company records these non-marketable equity securities as a component\nof other\nassets, which are periodically evaluated for impairment. Management considers\nthese non-marketable equity securities to\nbe long-term investments. Accordingly,\nwhen evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers\nthe\nultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in\nvalue.\nFair Value\nDetermination\nU.S. GAAP requires management to value and disclose certain of the Company's\nassets and liabilities at fair value,\nincluding investments classified as available-for-sale and derivatives.\nASC 820,\nFair Value\nMeasurements and Disclosures\n,\nwhich defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP and expands\ndisclosures about fair value measurements.\nFor more information regarding fair value measurements and disclosures,\nplease refer to Note 14, Fair Value,\nof the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.\nFair values are based on active market prices of identical assets or liabilities when available.\nComparable assets or\nliabilities or a composite of comparable assets in active markets are used when identical assets\nor liabilities do not have\nreadily available active market pricing.\nHowever, some of the Company's\nassets or liabilities lack an available or\ncomparable trading market characterized by frequent transactions between\nwilling buyers and sellers. In these cases, fair\nvalue is estimated using pricing models that use discounted cash flows and\nother pricing techniques. Pricing models and\ntheir underlying assumptions are based upon management's\nbest estimates for appropriate discount rates, default rates,\nprepayments, market volatility and other factors, taking into account current observable\nmarket data and experience.\nThese assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported\nfair values of assets and liabilities and the related income\nand expense. As such, the use of different models and assumptions, as\nwell as changes in market conditions, could result in\nmaterially different net earnings and retained earnings results.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned ( OREO\u201d), consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or\nin satisfaction of loans and is\nreported at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell at the date acquired with any loss\nrecognized as a\ncharge-off through the allowance for loan losses. Additional\nOREO losses for subsequent valuation adjustments are\ndetermined on a specific property basis and are included as a component of other noninterest\nexpense along with holding\ncosts. Any gains or losses on disposal of OREO are also reflected in noninterest expense.\nSignificant judgments and\ncomplex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of OREO, and the period of time\nwithin which such estimates\ncan be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of\nmarket volatility. As a result, the net proceeds\nrealized from sales transactions could differ significantly from\nappraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to\ndetermine the fair value of OREO.\nDeferred Tax\nAsset Valuation\nA valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of available\nevidence, it is more-likely-\nthan-not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The\nultimate realization of deferred tax assets\nis dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods\nin which those temporary differences become\ndeductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred\ntax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax\nplanning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of taxable income over\nthe last three years and\nprojections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are\ndeductible, management believes\nit is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences\nat December 31, 2021. The amount\nof the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however,\ncould be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are\nreduced.\nAverage Balance\nSheet and Interest Rates\nYear ended December 31\nAverage\nYield/\nAverage\nYield/\n(Dollars in thousands)\nBalance\nRate\nBalance\nRate\nLoans and loans held for sale\n$\n459,712\n4.45%\n$\n465,378\n4.74%\nSecurities - taxable\n320,766\n1.28%\n234,420\n1.68%\nSecurities - tax-exempt (a)\n62,736\n3.57%\n63,029\n3.72%\nTotal securities\n383,502\n1.66%\n297,449\n2.11%\nFederal funds sold\n38,659\n0.15%\n30,977\n0.41%\nInterest bearing bank deposits\n77,220\n0.13%\n56,104\n0.41%\nTotal interest-earning assets\n959,093\n2.81%\n849,908\n3.38%\nDeposits:\nNOW\n178,197\n0.12%\n154,431\n0.34%\nSavings and money market\n296,708\n0.22%\n242,485\n0.44%\nCertificates of deposits\n159,111\n1.03%\n165,120\n1.36%\nTotal interest-bearing deposits\n634,016\n0.39%\n562,036\n0.68%\nShort-term borrowings\n3,349\n0.51%\n1,864\n0.48%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n637,365\n0.39%\n563,900\n0.68%\nNet interest income and margin (a)\n$\n24,460\n2.55%\n$\n24,830\n2.92%\n(a) Tax-equivalent.\nSee \"Table 1 - Explanation of Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures\".\nRESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nNet interest income (tax-equivalent) was $24.5 million in 2021, compared\nto $24.8 million in 2020.\nThis decrease was due\nto a decline in the Company's net interest\nmargin (tax-equivalent),\npartially offset by balance sheet growth.\nThe tax-equivalent yield on total interest-earning assets decreased by 57 basis points\nin 2021 from 2020 to 2.81%.\nThis\ndecrease was primarily due to the lower rate environment and changes in our asset\nmix from the significant increase in\ndeposits from government stimulus and relief programs and customers' increased savings.\nThe cost of total interest-bearing liabilities decreased 29 basis points to 0.39%\nin 2021 compared to 0.68 in 2020.\nThe net\ndecrease in our funding costs was primarily due to lower prevailing market interest rates.\nOur funding costs declined less\nthan the rates earned on our interest earning assets.\nThe Company continues to deploy various asset liability management strategies\nto manage its risk to interest rate\nfluctuations. The Company's\nnet interest margin could experience pressure due to reduced earning asset\nyields and\nincreased competition for quality loan opportunities.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to provide\nan allowance for loan losses that\nmanagement believes, based on its processes and estimates, should be adequate\nto provide for the probable losses on\noutstanding loans. The Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.6\nmillion during 2021, compared to\n$1.1 million in provision for loan losses during 2020.\nThe negative provision for loan losses was primarily related to\nimprovements in economic conditions in our primary market area.\nThe provision for loan losses is based upon various\nfactors, including the absolute level of loans, loan growth, the credit quality,\nand the amount of net charge-offs or\nrecoveries.\nBased upon its assessment of the loan portfolio, management adjusts the allowance\nfor loan losses to an amount it believes\nshould be appropriate to adequately cover its estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio.\nThe Company's allowance\nfor loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.08% at December 31, 2021, compared\nto 1.22% at December 31, 2020.\nExcluding PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the SBA, the Company's\nallowance for loan losses was 1.10% and 1.27% of\ntotal loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWhile the policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance\nfor loan losses, as well as the resulting provision for loan losses charged to operations,\nare considered adequate by\nmanagement and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators, they are based on estimates\nand judgments and are\ntherefore approximate and imprecise. Factors beyond our control (such as conditions\nin the local and national economy,\nlocal real estate markets, or industries) may have a material adverse effect\non our asset quality and the adequacy of our\nallowance for loan losses resulting in significant increases in the provision\nfor loan losses.\nNoninterest Income\nYear ended December 31\n(Dollars in thousands)\nService charges on deposit accounts\n$\n$\nMortgage lending\n1,547\n2,319\nBank-owned life insurance\nSecurities gains, net\nOther\n1,757\n1,644\nTotal noninterest income\n$\n4,288\n$\n5,375\nThe decrease in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily driven by a decline\nin consumer spending activity as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company's income from mortgage lending\nis primarily attributable to the (1) origination and sale of new mortgage\nloans and (2) servicing of mortgage loans. Origination income, net, is comprised of gains\nor losses from the sale of the\nmortgage loans originated, origination fees, underwriting fees and other fees associated\nwith the origination of loans, which\nare netted against the commission expense associated with these originations. The\nCompany's normal practice is to\noriginate mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market and to either sell or\nretain the MSRs when the loan is sold.\nMSRs are recognized based on the fair value of the servicing right on the date the corresponding\nmortgage loan is sold.\nSubsequent to the date of transfer, the Company\nhas elected to measure its MSRs under the amortization method.\nServicing\nfee income is reported net of any related amortization expense.\nThe Company evaluates MSRs for impairment on a quarterly basis.\nImpairment is determined by grouping MSRs by\ncommon predominant characteristics, such as interest rate and loan type.\nIf the aggregate carrying amount of a particular\ngroup of MSRs exceeds the group's aggregate fair\nvalue, a valuation allowance for that group is established.\nThe valuation\nallowance is adjusted as the fair value changes.\nAn increase in mortgage interest rates typically results in an increase in the\nfair value of the MSRs while a decrease in mortgage interest rates typically results in a decrease\nin the fair value of MSRs.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the Company's\nmortgage lending income for 2021 and 2020.\nYear ended December 31\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOrigination income\n$\n1,417\n$\n2,300\nServicing fees, net\nTotal mortgage lending income\n$\n1,547\n$\n2,319\nThe Company's income from mortgage lending\ntypically fluctuates as mortgage interest rates change and is primarily\nattributable to the origination and sale of new mortgage loans. Origination income\ndecreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due\nto a decrease in refinance activity in our primary market.\nThe decrease in origination income was partially offset by an\nincrease in servicing fees, net of related amortization expense as prepayment\nspeeds slowed during 2021, resulting in\ndecreased amortization expense.\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance decreased primarily due to $0.3\nmillion in non-taxable death benefits received in\n2020. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers\nand the income we receive (i.e.,\nincreases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies and death benefits received)\non these policies is dependent\nupon the returns the insurance carriers are able to earn on the underlying investments that\nsupport these policies. Earnings\non these policies are generally not taxable.\nNoninterest Expense\nYear ended December 31\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalaries and benefits\n$\n11,710\n$\n11,316\nNet occupancy and equipment\n1,743\n2,511\nProfessional fees\n1,052\nFDIC and other regulatory assessments\nOther\n4,559\n4,419\nTotal noninterest expense\n$\n19,433\n$\n19,554\nThe increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to a decrease in deferred\ncosts related to the PPP loan\nprogram, routine annual wage and benefit increases, and management increasing the\nminimum hourly wage for banking\npositions to $15.\nThe decrease in net occupancy and equipment was primarily due to a reduction\nof various expenses related to the\nredevelopment of the Company's headquarters\nin downtown Auburn.\nThis amount includes revised depreciation estimates\nand other temporary relocation costs. For more information regarding changes\nin accounting estimates, please refer to Note\n1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements\nthat accompany this report.\nThe increase in FDIC and other regulatory assessments was primarily due to the expiration\nof FDIC assessment credits\nduring 2020 and an increased assessment base during 2021.\nIncome Tax\nExpense\nIncome tax expense was $1.4 million in 2021 and $1.6 million in 2020.\nThe Company's effective income\ntax rate was\n14.89% in 2021, compared to 17.72% in 2020.\nThis change was primarily due to an income tax benefit related to a New\nMarkets Tax Credit investment\nfunded in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe Company's effective income\ntax rate is\nprincipally impacted by tax-exempt earnings from the Company's\ninvestments in municipal securities, bank-owned life\ninsurance, and New Markets Tax\nCredits.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nSecurities\nSecurities available-for-sale were $421.9\nmillion at December 31, 2021, compared to $335.2 million at December 31, 2020.\nThis increase reflects an increase in the amortized cost basis of securities available-for-sale\nof $95.7 million, and a decrease\nof $9.0 million in the fair value of securities available-for-sale.\nThe increase in the amortized cost basis of securities\navailable-for-sale was primarily attributable to management\nallocating more funding to the investment portfolio following\nthe significant increases in customer deposits. The decrease in the fair value of securities\nwas primarily due to an increase\nin long-term interest rates. The average annualized tax-equivalent\nyields earned on total securities were 1.66%\nin 2021 and\n2.11%\nin 2020.\nThe following table shows the carrying value and weighted average yield of securities available\n-for-sale as of December\n31, 2021 according to contractual maturity.\nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of mortgage-backed\nsecurities ( MBS\u201d) because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called\nor prepaid with or without penalty.\nDecember 31, 2021\n1 year\n1 to 5\n5 to 10\nAfter 10\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands)\nor less\nyears\nyears\nyears\nFair Value\nAgency obligations\n$\n5,007\n49,604\n69,802\n-\n124,413\nAgency MBS\n-\n35,855\n186,836\n223,371\nState and political subdivisions\n15,743\n57,547\n74,107\nTotal available-for-sale\n$\n5,177\n50,931\n121,400\n244,383\n421,891\nWeighted average yield (1):\nAgency obligations\n2.00%\n1.36%\n1.31%\n-\n1.36%\nAgency MBS\n-\n3.42%\n1.48%\n1.34%\n1.37%\nState and political subdivisions\n4.25%\n2.85%\n2.18%\n2.77%\n2.64%\nTotal available-for-sale\n2.07%\n1.40%\n1.47%\n1.68%\n1.59%\n(1) Yields are calculated based on amortized cost.\nLoans\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n83,977\n82,585\nConstruction and land development\n32,432\n33,514\nCommercial real estate\n258,371\n255,136\nResidential real estate\n77,661\n84,154\nConsumer installment\n6,682\n7,099\nTotal loans\n459,123\n462,488\nLess:\nunearned income\n(759)\n(788)\nLoans, net of unearned income\n$\n458,364\n461,700\nTotal loans, net of unearned income,\nwere $458.4 million at December 31, 2021, and $461.7 million at December\n31, 2020.\nExcluding PPP loans, total loans, net of unearned income, were $450.5\nmillion, an increase of $7.5 million, or 2% from\nDecember 31, 2020.\nThis increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial and industrial loans\n,\nnet of PPP,\nof\n$12.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in residential real estate loans of\n$6.5 million, as lower rates increased refinance\nactivity and payoffs for consumer mortgage loans.\nFour loan categories represented the majority of the loan portfolio at\nDecember 31, 2021: commercial real estate (56%), residential real estate (17%),\ncommercial and industrial (18%) and\nconstruction and land development (7%).\nApproximately 25% of the Company's commercial\nreal estate loans were\nclassified as owner-occupied at December 31, 2021.\nWithin the residential real estate portfolio\nsegment, the Company had junior lien mortgages of approximately $7.2 million,\nor 2%, and $8.7 million, or 2%, of total loans, net of unearned income at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor\nresidential real estate mortgage loans with a consumer purpose, the Company\nhad no loans that required interest only\npayments at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company's\nresidential real estate mortgage portfolio does not include any\noption ARM loans, subprime loans, or any material amount of other high-risk consumer\nmortgage products.\nThe average yield earned on loans and loans held for sale was 4.45% in 2021\nand 4.74% in 2020.\nThe specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio include,\nbut are not limited to, the effects of\ncurrent economic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic's\neffects, on our borrowers' cash flows, real estate market\nsales volumes, valuations, availability and cost of financing properties,\nreal estate industry concentrations, competitive\npressures from a wide range of other lenders, deterioration in certain credits, interest rate\nfluctuations, reduced collateral\nvalues or non-existent collateral, title defects, inaccurate appraisals, financial deterioration\nof borrowers, fraud, and any\nviolation of applicable laws and regulations.\nThe Company attempts to reduce these economic and credit risks through its loan-to-value\nguidelines for collateralized\nloans, investigating the creditworthiness of borrowers and monitoring borrowers' financial\nposition. Also, we have\nestablished and periodically review,\nlending policies and procedures. Banking regulations limit a bank's\ncredit exposure by\nprohibiting unsecured loan relationships that exceed 10% of its capital; or 20%\nof capital, if loans in excess of 10% of\ncapital are fully secured. Under these regulations, we are prohibited from having secured\nloan relationships in excess of\napproximately $21.0 million. Furthermore, we have an internal limit\nfor aggregate credit exposure (loans outstanding plus\nunfunded commitments) to a single borrower of $18.9\nmillion. Our loan policy requires that the Loan Committee of the\nBoard of Directors approve any loan relationships that exceed this internal limit.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bank had no\nrelationships exceeding these limits.\nWe periodically analyze\nour commercial loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit\nrisk exists in any one or\nmore industries. We\nuse classification systems broadly accepted by the financial services industry in\norder to categorize our\ncommercial borrowers. Loan concentrations to borrowers in the following classes\nexceeded 25% of the Bank's total risk-\nbased capital at December 31, 2021 (and related balances at December 31,\n2020).\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nLessors of 1-4 family residential properties\n$\n47,880\n$\n49,127\nHotel/motel\n43,856\n42,900\nMulti-family residential properties\n42,587\n40,203\nShopping centers\n29,574\n30,000\nIn light of disruptions in economic conditions caused by COVID-19, the financial regulators\nhave issued guidance\nencouraging banks to work constructively with borrowers affected\nby the virus in our community.\nThis guidance, including\nthe Interagency Statement on COVID-19 Loan Modifications and the Interagency Examiner\nGuidance for Assessing Safety\nand Soundness Considering the Effect of the COVID-19\nPandemic on Institutions, provides that the agencies will not\ncriticize financial institutions that mitigate credit risk through prudent actions\nconsistent with safe and sound practices.\nSpecifically, examiners\nwill not criticize institutions for working with borrowers as part of a risk\nmitigation strategy\nintended to improve existing loans, even if the restructured loans have or develop\nweaknesses that ultimately result in\nadverse credit classification.\nUpon demonstrating the need for payment relief, the bank will work with qualified borrowers\nthat were otherwise current before the pandemic to determine the most appropriate\ndeferral option.\nFor residential\nmortgage and consumer loans the borrower may elect to defer payments for up to three\nmonths.\nInterest continues to\naccrue and the amount due at maturity increases.\nCommercial real estate, commercial, and small business borrowers may\nelect to defer payments for up to three months or pay scheduled interest payments for a\nsix-month period.\nThe bank\nrecognizes that a combination of the payment relief options may be prudent dependent\non a borrower's business type.\nAs\nof December 31, 2021, we had one COVID-19 loan deferral totaling $0.1\nmillion, compared to $32.3 million, or 7% of total\nloans at December 31, 2020.\nThe tables below provide information concerning the composition of these COVID-19\nmodifications as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020.\nCOVID-19 Modifications\nModification Types\n(Dollars in thousands)\n# of Loans\nModified\nBalance\n% of Portfolio\nModified\nInterest Only\nPayment\nP&I\nPayments\nDeferred\nDecember 31, 2021:\nResidential real estate\n$\n-\n-\n%\nTotal\n$\n-\n%\n-\n%\n%\nDecember 31, 2020:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n-\n%\n%\n-\n%\nCommercial real estate\n31,399\n-\nResidential real estate\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n32,273\n%\n%\n%\nCOVID-19 Modifications within Commercial Real Estate\nSegment\n(Dollars in thousands)\n# of Loans\nModified\nBalance of\nLoans Modified\n% of Total\nLoan Class\nDecember 31, 2020:\nHotel/motel\n$\n26,427\n%\nMultifamily\n3,530\nRestaurants\n1,442\nThere were no COVID-19 modifications within the commercial real estate segment at December\n31, 2021.\nSection 4013 of the CARES Act provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law\nfrom classification as a TDR\npursuant to GAAP.\nIn addition, the Interagency Statement on COVID-19 Loan Modifications provides\ncircumstances in\nwhich a loan modification is not subject to classification as a TDR if such loan is not eligible\nfor modification under\nSection 4013.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes\nappropriate to adequately cover\nthe Company's estimate of probable\nlosses inherent in the loan portfolio.

The level of the allowance\nis based upon management's evaluation\nof the loan portfolios, past loan\nloss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that\nmay affect the borrower's ability to repay\n(including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying\ncollateral, composition of the loan\nportfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan loss rates, and other\npertinent factors. This evaluation is\ninherently subjective as it requires various material estimates and judgments including\nthe amounts and timing of future\ncash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to\nsignificant change. The ratio of our\nallowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding was 1.08% at December 31,\n2021, compared to 1.22% at December 31,\n2020.\nExcluding PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the SBA, the Company's\nallowance for loan losses was 1.10% and\n1.27% of total loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn the future, the allowance to total loans outstanding\nratio will increase or decrease to the extent the factors that influence our quarterly allowance\nassessment, including the\nduration and magnitude of COVID-19 effects, in their entirety either improve\nor weaken.\nIn addition our regulators, as an\nintegral part of their examination process, will periodically review the Company's\nallowance for loan losses, and may\nrequire the Company to make additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses based\non their judgment about\ninformation available to them at the time of their examinations.\nNonperforming Assets\nAt December 31, 2021 the Company had $0.8\nmillion in nonperforming assets compared to $0.5\nmillion at December 31,\n2020.\nThe table below provides information concerning total nonperforming assets\nand certain asset quality ratios.\nDecember 31\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNonperforming assets:\nNonperforming (nonaccrual) loans\n$\nOther real estate owned\n-\nTotal nonperforming assets\n$\nas a % of loans and other real estate owned\n0.18\n%\n0.12\nas a % of total assets\n0.07\n%\n0.06\nNonperforming loans as a % of total loans\n0.10\n%\n0.12\nAccruing loans 90 days or more past due\n$\n-\nThe table below provides information concerning the composition of nonaccrual\nloans at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nNonaccrual loans:\nCommercial real estate\n$\nResidential real estate\nTotal nonaccrual loans /\nnonperforming loans\n$\nThe Company discontinues the accrual of interest income when (1) there is a significant\ndeterioration in the financial\ncondition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected or\n(2) the principal or interest is more\nthan 90 days past due, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection.\nAt December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively, the Company\nhad $0.4\nmillion and $0.5\nmillion in loans on nonaccrual.\nAt December 31, 2021 there were no loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest, compared\nto $0.1 million at\nDecember 31, 2020.\nThe table below provides information concerning the composition of OREO at December\n31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nOther real estate owned:\nCommercial real estate\n$\n-\nTotal other real estate owned\n$\n-\nPotential Problem Loans\nPotential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and\nwhere information about possible credit\nproblems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the\nborrower's ability to comply with present\nrepayment terms.\nThis definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards\nestablished by the Federal\nReserve, the Company's primary regulator,\nfor loans classified as substandard, excluding nonaccrual loans.\nPotential\nproblem loans, which are not included in nonperforming assets, amounted to $2.4\nmillion, or 0.5% of total loans at\nDecember 31, 2021, compared to $2.9 million, or 1.0% of total loans at December 31, 2020.\nThe table below provides information concerning the composition of potential problem\nloans at December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively.\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nPotential problem loans:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\nConstruction and land development\nCommercial real estate\nResidential real estate\n1,748\n2,229\nConsumer installment\nTotal potential problem loans\n$\n2,360\n2,912\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately $0.3\nmillion or 14.2% of total potential problem loans were past due at least 30 but\nless than 90 days.\nThe following table is a summary of the Company's\nperforming loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than\n90 days as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nPerforming loans past due 30 to 89 days:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\nConstruction and land development\nCommercial real estate\n-\nResidential real estate\n1,509\nConsumer installment\nTotal performing loans past due\n30 to 89 days\n$\n1,858\nDeposits\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nNoninterest bearing demand\n$\n316,132\n245,398\nNOW\n183,021\n155,870\nMoney market\n244,195\n199,937\nSavings\n91,245\n78,187\nCertificates of deposit under $250,000\n101,660\n105,357\nCertificates of deposit and other time deposits of $250,000 or more\n57,990\n55,044\nTotal deposits\n$\n994,243\n839,793\nTotal deposits increased\n$154.5 million, or 18%, to $994.2 million at December 31, 2021,\ncompared to $839.8 million at\nDecember 31, 2020.

The rules included\nthe implementation of a\ncapital conservation buffer that is added to the minimum requirements\nfor capital adequacy purposes. The capital\nconservation buffer was subject to a three year phase-in period\nthat began on January 1, 2016 and was fully phased-in on\nJanuary 1, 2019 at 2.5%. A banking organization with a conservation buffer\nof less than the required amount will be subject\nto limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary\nbonus payments to executive\nofficers. At December 31, 2021, the Bank's\nratio was sufficient to meet the fully phased-in conservation\nbuffer.\nEffective March 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve and the other federal\nbanking regulators adopted an interim final rule that\namended the capital conservation buffer.\nThe interim final rule was adopted as a final rule on August 26, 2020. The\nnew\nrule revises the definition of eligible retained income\u201d for purposes of the maximum payout\nratio to allow banking\norganizations to more freely use their capital buffers to promote\nlending and other financial intermediation activities, by\nmaking the limitations on capital distributions more gradual. The\neligible retained income is now the greater of (i) net\nincome for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects\nnot reflected in net income; and (ii)\nthe average of all net income over the preceding four quarters. The interim\nfinal rule only affects the capital buffers, and\nbanking organizations were encouraged to make prudent capital\ndistribution decisions.\nThe Federal Reserve has treated us as a small bank holding company' under the Federal\nReserve's policy.\nAccordingly,\nour capital adequacy is evaluated at the Bank level, and not for the Company and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. The Bank's\ntier 1 leverage ratio was 9.35%, CET1 risk-based capital ratio was 16.23%, tier 1 risk-based\ncapital ratio was 16.23%, and\ntotal risk-based capital ratio was 17.06%\nat December 31, 2021. These ratios exceed the minimum regulatory capital\npercentages of 5.0% for tier 1 leverage ratio, 6.5% for CET1 risk-based capital ratio,\n8.0% for tier 1 risk-based capital ratio,\nand 10.0% for total risk-based capital ratio to be considered well capitalized.\u201d\nThe Bank's capital conservation buffer\nwas\n9.06%\nat December 31, 2021.\nMARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT\nManagement's objective is to manage assets and\nliabilities to provide a satisfactory,\nconsistent level of profitability within\nthe framework of established liquidity,\nloan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. The Bank's\nAsset Liability\nManagement Committee ( ALCO\u201d) is charged with the responsibility\nof monitoring these policies, which are designed to\nensure an acceptable asset/liability composition. Two\ncritical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate risk and liquidity\nrisk management.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to market risk arising from\nfluctuations in interest rates because\nassets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. For example,\nif liabilities reprice faster than assets, and\ninterest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially decline. In addition, assets\nand liabilities may reprice at the same\ntime but by different amounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates is rising,\nthe Company may increase\nrates paid on interest bearing demand deposit accounts and savings deposit\naccounts by an amount that is less than the\ngeneral increase in market interest rates. Also, short-term and long-term\nmarket interest rates may change by different\namounts. For example, a flattening yield curve may reduce the interest spread\nbetween new loan yields and funding costs.\nFurther, the remaining maturity of various assets and\nliabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For\nexample, if long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply,\nmortgage-backed securities in the securities portfolio may\nprepay earlier than anticipated, which could reduce earnings. Interest rates may also\nhave a direct or indirect effect on loan\ndemand, loan losses, mortgage origination volume, the fair value of MSRs and other\nitems affecting earnings.\nALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands\nfor various types of loans and\ndeposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and\noff-balance sheet items. Measurements\nused to help manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation and an economic\nvalue of equity model.\nEarnings simulation\n. Management believes that interest rate risk is best estimated by our earnings simulation\nmodeling.\nOn at least a quarterly basis, the following 12 month time period is simulated to determine a\nbaseline net interest income\nforecast and the sensitivity of this forecast to changes in interest rates. The baseline forecast\nassumes an unchanged or flat\ninterest rate environment. Forecasted levels of earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities,\nand off-balance sheet financial\ninstruments are combined with ALCO forecasts of market interest rates for\nthe next 12 months and other factors in order to\nproduce various earnings simulations and estimates.\nTo help limit interest rate risk,\nwe have guidelines for earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest\nincome from gradual changes in interest rates.\nFor changes up or down in rates from management's\nflat interest rate\nforecast over the next 12 months, policy limits for net interest income variances are as follows:\n+/- 20% for a gradual change of 400 basis points\n+/- 15% for a gradual change of 300 basis points\n+/- 10% for a gradual change of 200 basis points\n+/- 5% for a gradual change of 100 basis points\nThe following table reports the variance of net interest income over the next 12\nmonths assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates up or down when compared to the baseline net interest income\nforecast at December 31, 2021.\nChanges in Interest Rates\nNet Interest Income % Variance\n400 basis points\n7.92\n%\n300 basis points\n5.61\n200 basis points\n3.59\n100 basis points\n1.54\n(100) basis points\n(0.44)\n(200) basis points\nNM\n(300) basis points\nNM\n(400) basis points\nNM\nNM=not meaningful\nAt December 31, 2021, our earnings simulation model indicated that\nwe were in compliance with the policy guidelines\nnoted above.\nEconomic Value\nof Equity\nEconomic value of equity ( EVE\u201d) measures the extent that estimated econom\nic values of our assets, liabilities and off-\nbalance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are\nestimated by discounting expected\ncash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items,\nwhich establishes a base case EVE. In contrast with our\nearnings simulation model which evaluates interest rate risk over a 12\nmonth timeframe, EVE uses a terminal horizon\nwhich allows for the re-pricing of all assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items.\nFurther, EVE is measured using values\nas of a point in time and does not reflect any actions that ALCO might take in responding to\nor anticipating changes in\ninterest rates, or market and competitive conditions.\nTo help limit interest rate risk,\nwe have stated policy guidelines for an instantaneous basis point change in interest rates,\nsuch that our EVE should not decrease from our base case by more than the following:\n45% for an instantaneous change of +/- 400 basis points\n35% for an instantaneous change of +/- 300 basis points\n25% for an instantaneous change of +/- 200 basis points\n15% for an instantaneous change of +/- 100 basis points\nThe following table reports the variance of EVE assuming an immediate change in\ninterest rates up or down when\ncompared to the baseline EVE at December 31, 2021.\nChanges in Interest Rates\nEVE % Variance\n400 basis points\n(20.53)\n%\n300 basis points\n(14.14)\n200 basis points\n(8.35)\n100 basis points\n(3.23)\n(100) basis points\n0.91\n(200) basis points\nNM\n(300) basis points\nNM\n(400) basis points\nNM\nNM=not meaningful\nAt December 31, 2021, our EVE model indicated that we were in compliance\nwith the policy guidelines noted above.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest\nincome will be affected by\nchanges in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated\nwith interest-bearing liabilities\nmay not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition,\nthe magnitude and duration of changes in interest\nrates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain\nassets and liabilities may have\nsimilar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different\ndegrees to changes in market interest rates, and other\neconomic and market factors, including market perceptions.\nInterest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate\nin advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types of assets\nand liabilities may lag behind\nchanges in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate\nmortgage loans, have features (generally\nreferred to as interest rate caps and floors\u201d) which limit changes in interest rates.\nPrepayment and early withdrawal levels\nalso could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments.\nThe ability of many\nborrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates or\neconomic stress, which may\ndiffer across industries and economic sectors. ALCO reviews each of the\nabove interest rate sensitivity analyses along with\nseveral different interest rate scenarios in seeking satisfactory,\nconsistent levels of profitability within the framework of the\nCompany's established liquidity,\nloan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.\nThe Company may also use derivative financial instruments to improve the balance between\ninterest-sensitive assets and\ninterest-sensitive liabilities and as one tool to manage interest rate sensitivity\nwhile continuing to meet the credit and\ndeposit needs of our customers. From time to time, the Company may enter into\ninterest rate swaps ( swaps\u201d) to facilitate\ncustomer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives,\nbut are not designated as hedging\ninstruments. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no derivative\ncontracts to assist in managing interest rate\nsensitivity.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity is the Company's ability to convert\nassets into cash equivalents in order to meet daily cash flow requirements,\nprimarily for deposit withdrawals, loan demand and maturing obligations. Without\nproper management of its liquidity,\nthe\nCompany could experience higher costs of obtaining funds due to insufficient liquidity,\nwhile excessive liquidity can lead\nto a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative higher-yielding\ninvestment opportunities.\nLiquidity is managed at two levels. The first is the liquidity of the Company.\nThe second is the liquidity of the Bank. The\nmanagement of liquidity at both levels is essential, because the Company and the Bank are\nseparate and distinct legal\nentities with different funding needs and sources, and each are subject\nto regulatory guidelines and requirements. The\nCompany depends upon dividends from the Bank for liquidity to pay its operating expenses,\ndebt obligations and\ndividends. The Bank's payment of dividends depends\non its earnings, liquidity,\ncapital and the absence of any regulatory\nrestrictions.\nThe primary source of funding and liquidity for the Company has been dividends received\nfrom the Bank. If needed, the\nCompany could also issue common stock or other securities. Primary uses of funds by the\nCompany include dividends paid\nto stockholders and stock repurchases.\nPrimary sources of funding for the Bank include customer deposits, other borrowings,\nrepayment and maturity of securities,\nand sale and repayment of loans.\nThe Bank has access to federal funds lines from various banks and borrowings\nfrom the\nFederal Reserve discount window.\nIn addition to these sources, the Bank has participated in the FHLB's advance program\nto obtain funding for its growth. Advances include both fixed and variable terms and\nare taken out with varying maturities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Bank had a remaining available line of credit with the FHLB\ntotaling $319.6 million.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Bank also had $41.0 million of federal funds lines, with none outstanding.\nPrimary uses of funds\ninclude repayment of maturing obligations and growing the loan portfolio.\nThe following table presents additional information about our contractual obligations\nas of December 31, 2021, which by\ntheir terms had contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December\n31, 2021:\nPayments due by period\n1 year\n1 to 3\n3 to 5\nMore than\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTotal\nor less\nyears\nyears\n5 years\nContractual obligations:\nDeposit maturities (1)\n$\n994,243\n948,364\n37,905\n7,785\nOperating lease obligations\nTotal\n$\n994,853\n948,484\n38,144\n7,926\n(1) Deposits with no stated maturity (demand, NOW, money market, and savings deposits) are\npresented in the \"1 year or less\" column\nManagement believes that the Company and the Bank have adequate sources of liquidity to\nmeet all known contractual\nobligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower,\ndepositor, and creditor\nrequirements over the next 12 months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bank had outstanding standby letters of credit of $1.\nmillion and unfunded loan commitments\noutstanding of $71.0 million. Because these commitments generally\nhave fixed expiration dates and many will expire\nwithout being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future\ncash requirements. If needed to\nfund these outstanding commitments, the Bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds\nsold or securities available-for-sale,\nor on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial\ninstitutions.\nResidential mortgage lending and servicing activities\nWe primarily sell conforming\nresidential mortgage loans in the secondary market to Fannie Mae\nwhile retaining the\nservicing of these loans. The sale agreements for these residential mortgage loans with\nFannie Mae and other investors\ninclude various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics\nof the residential mortgage\nloans. Although the representations and warranties vary among investors, they typically\ncover ownership of the loan,\nvalidity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing\nthe loan,\ncompliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, compliance with applicable\nfederal, state, and local\nlaws, among other matters.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans,\nwhich we have originated and sold,\nbut retained the servicing rights was $252.7 million. Although these loans are\ngenerally sold on a non-recourse basis,\nexcept for breaches of customary seller representations and warranties,\nwe may have to repurchase residential mortgage\nloans in cases where we breach such representations or warranties or the other terms of\nthe sale, such as where we fail to\ndeliver required documents or the documents we deliver are defective. Investors also\nmay require the repurchase of a\nmortgage loan when an early payment default underwriting review reveals significant\nunderwriting deficiencies, even if the\nmortgage loan has subsequently been brought current. Repurchase demands are typically\nreviewed on an individual loan by\nloan basis to validate the claims made by the investor and to determine if a contractually\nrequired repurchase event has\noccurred. We\nseek to reduce and manage the risks of potential repurchases or other claims by mortgage loan investors\nthrough our underwriting, quality assurance and servicing practices, including\ngood communications with our residential\nmortgage investors.\nThe Company was not required to repurchase any loans during 2021 and 2020\nas a result of representation and warranty\nprovisions contained in the Company's sale agreements\nwith Fannie Mae, and had no pending repurchase or make-whole\nrequests at December 31, 2021.\nWe service all residential\nmortgage loans originated and sold by us to Fannie Mae. As servicer,\nour primary duties are to:\n(1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments\nof principal and interest; (3) maintain\nand administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to\nthe mortgage loans; (4) maintain any\nrequired escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments;\nand (5) foreclose on\ndefaulted mortgage loans or take other actions to mitigate the potential losses to investors\nconsistent with the agreements\ngoverning our rights and duties as servicer.\nThe agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a\nstandard of responsibility for actions taken by us in\nsuch capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by us\nwhen acting in compliance with the\nrespective servicing agreements. However, if\nwe commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer,\nwe may be subject\nto termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice. The\nstandards governing servicing and\nthe possible remedies for violations of such standards are determined by servicing\nguides issued by Fannie Mae as well as\nthe contract provisions established between Fannie Mae and the Bank.\nRemedies could include repurchase of an affected\nloan.\nAlthough to date repurchase requests related to representation and warranty provisions,\nand servicing activities have been\nlimited, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may increase in frequency\nif investors more aggressively\npursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans. As of December\n31, 2021, we believe that this exposure is\nnot material due to the historical level of repurchase requests and loss trends, the results of\nour quality control reviews, and\nthe fact that 99% of our residential mortgage loans serviced for Fannie Mae\nwere current as of such date. We\nmaintain\nongoing communications with our investors and will continue to evaluate this exposure\nby monitoring the level and number\nof repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in our investor portfolios.\nSection 4021 of the CARES Act allows borrowers under 1-to-4 family residential\nmortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae to\nrequest forbearance to the servicer after affirming that such borrower\nis experiencing financial hardships during the\nCOVID-19 emergency.\nExcept for vacant or abandoned properties, Fannie Mae servicers may not initiate\nforeclosures on\nsimilar procedures or related evictions or sales until December 31, 2020.\nThe forbearance period was extended, generally,\nto March 31, 2021.\nThe Bank sells mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and services these on an actual/actual\nbasis. As a result,\nthe Bank is not obligated to make any advances to Fannie Mae on principal and interest on\nsuch mortgage loans where the\nborrower is entitled to forbearance.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data\npresented herein have been prepared in\naccordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require\nthe measurement of financial position and\noperating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in\nthe relative purchasing power of money\nover time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities\nof a financial institution\nare monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a\nfinancial institution's performance\nthan the effects of general levels of inflation.\nCURRENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nThe following ASU has been issued by the FASB\nbut is not yet effective.\n\u25cf\nASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic\n326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments;\nInformation about this pronouncement is described in more detail below.\nASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic\n326): - Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial\nInstruments\n, amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and\navailable for sale debt\nsecurities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, the new standard eliminates the probable\ninitial recognition threshold in\ncurrent GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected\ncredit losses using a broader\nrange of information regarding past events, current conditions and forecasts assessing the\ncollectability of cash flows. The\nallowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized\ncost basis of the financial assets to\npresent the net amount expected to be collected. For available for sale debt securities, credit\nlosses should be measured in a\nmanner similar to current GAAP,\nhowever the new standard will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance\nrather than as a write-down. The new guidance affects entities holding\nfinancial assets and net investment in leases that are\nnot accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect\nloans, debt securities, trade receivables, net\ninvestments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables,\nand any other financial assets not\nexcluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. For public\nbusiness entities, the new guidance was\noriginally effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2019. The Company has\ndeveloped an implementation team that is following a general timeline. The\nteam has been working with an advisory\nconsultant, with whom a third-party software license has been purchased.\nThe Company's preliminary evaluation\nindicates\nthe provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 are expected to impact the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements, in particular\nthe level of the reserve for credit losses. The Company is continuing to evaluate the\nextent of the potential impact and\nexpects that portfolio composition and economic conditions at the time of adoption\nwill be a factor. On October 16, 2019,\nthe FASB approved\na previously issued proposal granting smaller reporting companies a postponement of the required\nimplementation date for ASU 2016-13. The Company will now be required\nto implement the new standard in January 2023,\nwith early adoption permitted in any period prior to that date.\nTable 1\n- Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP,\nthis annual report on Form 10-K includes certain designated net\ninterest income amounts presented on a tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure, including the presentation of\ntotal revenue and the calculation of the efficiency ratio.\nThe Company believes the presentation of net interest income on a tax-equivalent\nbasis provides comparability of net\ninterest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and facilitates comparability\nwithin the industry. Although the\nCompany believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors'\nunderstanding of its business and performance,\nthese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to\nGAAP.\nThe reconciliation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures from GAAP to non-GAAP is presented below.\nYear ended December 31\n(In thousands)\nNet interest income (GAAP)\n$\n23,990\n24,338\n26,064\n25,570\n24,526\nTax-equivalent adjustment\n1,205\nNet interest income (Tax-equivalent)\n$\n24,460\n24,830\n26,621\n26,183\n25,731\nTable 2\n- Selected Financial Data\nYear ended December 31\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nIncome statement\nTax-equivalent interest income (a)\n$\n26,977\n28,686\n30,804\n29,859\n29,325\nTotal interest expense\n2,517\n3,856\n4,183\n3,676\n3,594\nTax equivalent net interest income (a)\n24,460\n24,830\n26,621\n26,183\n25,731\nProvision for loan losses\n(600)\n1,100\n(250)\n-\n(300)\nTotal noninterest income\n4,288\n5,375\n5,494\n3,325\n3,441\nTotal noninterest expense\n19,433\n19,554\n19,697\n17,874\n16,784\nNet earnings before income taxes and\ntax-equivalent adjustment\n9,915\n9,551\n12,668\n11,634\n12,688\nTax-equivalent adjustment\n1,205\nIncome tax expense\n1,406\n1,605\n2,370\n2,187\n3,637\nNet earnings\n$\n8,039\n7,454\n9,741\n8,834\n7,846\nPer share data:\nBasic and diluted net earnings\n$\n2.27\n2.09\n2.72\n2.42\n2.15\nCash dividends declared\n$\n1.04\n1.02\n1.00\n0.96\n0.92\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic and diluted\n3,545,310\n3,566,207\n3,581,476\n3,643,780\n3,643,616\nShares outstanding\n3,520,485\n3,566,276\n3,566,146\n3,643,868\n3,643,668\nBook value\n$\n29.46\n30.20\n27.57\n24.44\n23.85\nCommon stock price\nHigh\n$\n48.00\n63.40\n53.90\n53.50\n40.25\nLow\n31.32\n24.11\n30.61\n28.88\n30.75\nPeriod-end\n$\n32.30\n42.29\n53.00\n31.66\n38.90\nTo earnings ratio\n14.23\nx\n20.23\n19.49\n13.08\n18.09\nTo book value\n%\nPerformance ratios:\nReturn on average equity\n7.54\n%\n7.12\n10.35\n10.14\n9.17\nReturn on average assets\n0.78\n%\n0.83\n1.18\n1.08\n0.94\nDividend payout ratio\n45.81\n%\n48.80\n36.76\n39.67\n42.79\nAverage equity to average assets\n10.39\n%\n11.63\n11.39\n10.63\n10.30\nAsset Quality:\nAllowance for loan losses as a % of:\nLoans\n1.08\n%\n1.22\n0.95\n1.00\n1.05\nNonperforming loans\n1,112\n%\n1,052\n2,345\n2,691\nNonperforming assets as a % of:\nLoans and other real estate owned\n0.18\n%\n0.12\n0.04\n0.07\n0.66\nTotal assets\n0.07\n%\n0.06\n0.02\n0.04\n0.35\nNonperforming loans as % of loans\n0.10\n%\n0.12\n0.04\n0.04\n0.66\nNet charge-offs (recoveries) as a % of average loans\n0.02\n%\n(0.03)\n0.03\n(0.01)\n(0.09)\nCapital Adequacy (c):\nCET 1 risk-based capital ratio\n16.23\n%\n17.27\n17.28\n16.49\n16.42\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio\n16.23\n%\n17.27\n17.28\n16.49\n16.98\nTotal risk-based capital ratio\n17.06\n%\n18.31\n18.12\n17.38\n17.91\nTier 1 leverage ratio\n9.35\n%\n10.32\n11.23\n11.33\n10.95\nOther financial data:\nNet interest margin (a)\n2.55\n%\n2.92\n3.43\n3.40\n3.29\nEffective income tax rate\n14.89\n%\n17.72\n19.57\n19.84\n31.67\nEfficiency ratio (b)\n67.60\n%\n64.74\n61.33\n60.57\n57.53\nSelected period end balances:\nSecurities\n$\n421,891\n335,177\n235,902\n239,801\n257,697\nLoans, net of unearned income\n458,364\n461,700\n460,901\n476,908\n453,651\nAllowance for loan losses\n4,939\n5,618\n4,386\n4,790\n4,757\nTotal assets\n1,105,150\n956,597\n828,570\n818,077\n853,381\nTotal deposits\n994,243\n839,792\n724,152\n724,193\n757,659\nLong-term debt\n-\n-\n-\n-\n3,217\nTotal stockholders' equity\n103,726\n107,689\n98,328\n89,055\n86,906\n(a) Tax-equivalent.\nSee \"Table 1 -

In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking\nstatements, so you should\nrefer to Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company was incorporated in 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware and became a bank\nholding company after\nit acquired its Alabama predecessor,\nwhich was a bank holding company established in 1984. The Bank, the Company's\nprincipal subsidiary, is an Alabama\nstate-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System and has operated\ncontinuously since 1907. Both the Company and the Bank are headquartered\nin Auburn, Alabama. The Bank conducts its\nbusiness primarily in East Alabama, including Lee County and surrounding areas.\nThe Bank operates full-service branches\nin Auburn, Opelika, Notasulga and Valley,\nAlabama.\nThe Bank also operates loan production offices in Auburn and\nPhenix City, Alabama.\nSummary of Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nNet interest income (a)\n$\n24,460\n$\n24,830\nLess: tax-equivalent adjustment\nNet interest income (GAAP)\n23,990\n24,338\nNoninterest income\n4,288\n5,375\nTotal revenue\n28,278\n29,713\nProvision for loan losses\n(600)\n1,100\nNoninterest expense\n19,433\n19,554\nIncome tax expense\n1,406\n1,605\nNet earnings\n$\n8,039\n$\n7,454\nBasic and diluted net earnings per share\n$\n2.27\n$\n2.09\n(a) Tax-equivalent.\nSee \"Table 1 - Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nFinancial Summary\nThe Company's net earnings were $8.0\nmillion for the full year 2021, compared to $7.5 million for the full year 2020.\nBasic and diluted net earnings per share were $2.27 per share for the full year 2021,\ncompared to $2.09 per share for the full\nyear 2020.\nNet interest income (tax-equivalent) was $24.5\nmillion in 2021, a 1% decrease compared to $24.8 million in 2020. This\ndecrease was primarily due to net interest margin compression\n,\npartially offset by balance sheet growth.\nNet interest\nmargin (tax-equivalent) decreased to 2.55% in 2021,\ncompared to 2.92% in 2020, primarily due to the lower interest rate\nenvironment and changes in our asset mix resulting from the significant increase\nin deposits from government stimulus and\nrelief programs and customers' increased savings.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company's allowance\nfor loan losses was $4.9 million, or 1.08% of total loans, compared to\n$5.6 million, or 1.22%\nof total loans, at December 31, 2020.\nExcluding\nPaycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) loans, which\nare guaranteed by the SBA,\nthe Company's allowance for loan losses\nwas 1.10% and 1.27% of total loans at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively\n.\nThe Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.6\nmillion in 2021 compared\nto a charge of $1.1 million during 2020.\nThe negative provision for loan losses was primarily related to improvements in\neconomic conditions in our primary market area, and related improvements in our\nasset quality.\nThe provision for loan\nlosses is based upon various estimates and judgements, including the absolute level\nof loans, loan growth, credit quality and\nthe amount of net charge-offs.\nNet charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 0.02% in 2021\n,\ncompared to net\nrecoveries as a percent of average loans of 0.03% in 2020.\nNoninterest income was $4.3 million in 2021 compared to $5.4\nmillion in 2020.\nThe decrease was primarily due to a $0.8\nmillion decrease in mortgage lending income in 2021 as refinance activity declined\nin our primary market area and a $0.3\nmillion non-taxable death benefit from bank-owned life insurance received\nin 2020.\nNoninterest expense was $19.4\nmillion in 2021 compared to $19.6\nmillion in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a\nreduction of $0.8\nmillion in various expenses related to the redevelopment of the Company's\nheadquarters in downtown\nAuburn.\nThis decrease was mostly offset by increases in salaries and benefits expe\nnse of $0.4 million and a $0.2 million\nincrease in FDIC and other regulatory assessments during 2021.\nIncome tax expense was $1.4\nmillion in 2021 and $1.6 million in 2020 reflecting an effective tax rate of 14.89\n%\nand\n17.72%, respectively.\nThis decrease was primarily due to an income tax benefit related to a New Markets Tax\nCredit\ninvestment funded in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe Company's effective income\ntax rate is principally impacted by tax-\nexempt earnings from the Company's investments\nin municipal securities, bank-owned life insurance, and New Markets\nTax Credits.\nThe Company paid cash dividends of $1.04\nper share in 2021, an increase of 2% from 2020. At December 31, 2021, the\nBank's regulatory capital ratios\nwere well above the minimum amounts required to be well capitalized\u201d under current\nregulatory standards with a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.06%,\na tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.35% and common equity tier\n1 ( CET1\u201d) of 16.23% at December 31, 2021.\nCOVID-19 Impact Assessment\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has occurred in waves of different\nvariants since the first quarter of 2020.\nVaccines\nto protect\nagainst and/or reduce the severity of COVID-19 were widely introduced at the beginning\nof 2021.\nAt times, the pandemic\nhas severely restricted the level of economic activity in our markets. In response to the COVID\n-19 pandemic, the State of\nAlabama, and most other states, have taken preventative or protective actions to prevent the\nspread of the virus, including\nimposing restrictions on travel and business operations and a statewide mask mandate,\nadvising or requiring individuals to\nlimit or forego their time outside of their homes, limitations on gathering of people and social distancing,\nand causing\ntemporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. Though certain\nof these measures have been\nrelaxed or eliminated, especially as vaccination levels increased, such\nmeasures could be reestablished in cases of new\nwaves, especially a wave of a COVID-19 variant that is more resistant\nto existing vaccines.\nCOVID-19 has significantly affected local state, national and global\nhealth and economic activity and its future effects are\nuncertain and will depend on various factors, including, among others, the duration\nand scope of the pandemic, especially\nnew variants of the virus, effective vaccines and drug treatments, together\nwith governmental, regulatory and private sector\nresponses. COVID-19 has had continuing significant effects\non the economy, financial\nmarkets and our employees,\ncustomers and vendors. Our business, financial condition and results of operations\ngenerally rely upon the ability of our\nborrowers to make deposits and repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our\nsecured loans, market value,\nstability and liquidity and demand for loans and other products and services we offer,\nall of which are affected by the\npandemic.\nWe have implemented\na number of procedures in response to the pandemic to support the safety and well-being of our\nemployees, customers and shareholders.\n\u2022\nWe believe our business continuity\nplan has worked to provide essential banking services to our communities and\ncustomers, while protecting our employees' health.\nAs part of our efforts to exercise social distancing in\naccordance with the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and the Governor\nof the State of Alabama,\nstarting March 23, 2020, we limited branch lobby service to appointment only while continuing\nto operate our\nbranch drive-thru facilities and ATMs.\nAs permitted by state public health guidelines, on June 1, 2020, we re-\nopened some of our branch lobbies.\nIn 2021, we opened our remaining branch lobbies.\nWe continue to provide\nservices through our online and other electronic channels.\nIn addition, we maintain remote work access to help\nemployees stay at home while providing continuity of service.\n\u2022\nWe are focused on servicing\nthe financial needs of our commercial and consumer clients with extensions\nand\ndeferrals to loan customers effected by COVID-19, provided\nsuch customers were not more than 30 days past due\nat the time of the request; and\n\u2022\nWe\nwere an active PPP lender. PPP loans were forgivable,\nin whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll\nand other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP.\nThese loans carry a fixed rate of\n1.00% and a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans\nmade on or after June 5,\n2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part.\nPayments are deferred until either the date on which the Small Business\nAdministration ( SBA\u201d) remits the amount of forgiveness proceeds\nto the lender or the date that is 10 months after\nthe last day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness\nwithin that 10-month period.\nWe\nbelieve these loans and our participation in the program helped our customers and the communities\nwe serve.\nCOVID-19 has also had various economic effects, generally.\nThese include supply chain disruptions and manufacturing\ndelays, shortages of certain goods and services, reduced consumer expenditure on\nhospitality and travel, and migration from\nlarger urban centers to less populated areas and remote work.\nThe demand for single family housing has exceeded existing\nsupplies.\nWhen coupled with construction delays attributable to supply chain disruptions\nand worker shortages, these\nfactors have caused housing prices and apartment rents to increase, generally.\nStimulative monetary and fiscal policy,\nalong with shortages of certain goods and services, and rising petroleum and food prices\nhave led to the highest inflation in\ndecades.\nAlthough fiscal stimulus remains under consideration by the President and Congress,\nthe Federal Reserve is\nconsidering increasing its target interest rates and reducing its holding of\nsecurities to stem inflation.\nA summary of PPP loans extended during 2020 follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n# of SBA\nApproved\nMix\n$ of SBA\nApproved\nMix\nSBA Tier:\n$2 million to $10 million\n-\n-\n%\n$\n-\n-\n%\n$350,000 to less than $2 million\n14,691\nUp to $350,000\n21,784\nTotal\n%\n$\n36,475\n%\nWe collected\napproximately $1.5 million in fees related to our PPP loans during 2020.\nThrough December 31, 2021, we\nhave recognized all of these fees, net of related costs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had received payments and\nforgiveness on all PPP loans extended during 2020.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits,\nand Venues\nAct (the Economic Aid\nAct\u201d) was signed into law.

Other policies also require subjective judgment and assumptions\nand may accordingly impact our\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company assesses the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses prior\nto the end of each calendar quarter. The level of\nthe allowance is based upon management's\nevaluation of the loan portfolio, past loan loss experience, current asset quality\ntrends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect\na borrower's ability to repay (including\nthe timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral,\ncomposition of the loan portfolio, economic\nconditions, industry and peer bank loan loss rates and other pertinent factors, including regulatory\nrecommendations. This\nevaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the\namounts and timing of future cash flows\nexpected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. Loans are\ncharged off, in whole or\nin part, when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely.\nA loan may be partially charged-off\nafter a confirming event\u201d has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant\nto the terms of the loan is\nunlikely.\nThe Company deems loans impaired when, based on current information and events, it is\nprobable that the Company will\nbe unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.\nCollection of all amounts due\naccording to the contractual terms means that both the interest and principal payments of a\nloan will be collected as\nscheduled in the loan agreement.\nAn impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded\ninvestment in the loan. The\nimpairment is recognized through the allowance. Loans that are impaired are\nrecorded at the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows discounted at the loan's effective\ninterest rate, or if the loan is collateral dependent, impairment\nmeasurement is based on the fair value of the collateral, less estimated disposal costs.\nThe level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate\nto absorb probable losses inherent in the\nportfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged\nto expense and decreased by charge-\noffs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off.\nIn assessing the adequacy of the allowance, the Company also considers the results of its\nongoing internal, independent\nloan review process. The Company's loan\nreview process assists in determining whether there are loans in the portfolio\nwhose credit quality has weakened over time and evaluating the risk characteristics of the\nentire loan portfolio. The\nCompany's loan review process includes the judgment\nof management, the input from our independent loan reviewers, and\nreviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination\nprocess. The Company\nincorporates loan review results in the determination of whether or not it is probable\nthat it will be able to collect all\namounts due according to the contractual terms of a loan.\nAs part of the Company's quarterly assessment\nof the allowance, management divides the loan portfolio into five segments:\ncommercial and industrial, construction and land development, commercial real estate, residential\nreal estate, and consumer\ninstallment loans. The Company\nanalyzes each segment and estimates an allowance allocation for each loan\nsegment.\nThe allocation of the allowance for loan losses begins with a process of estimating the\nprobable losses inherent for these\ntypes of loans. The estimates for these loans are established by category and based\non the Company's internal system of\ncredit risk ratings and historical loss data. The estimated loan loss allocation rate for the Company's\ninternal system of\ncredit risk grades is based on its experience with similarly graded loans. For\nloan segments where the Company believes it\ndoes not have sufficient historical loss data, the Company may\nmake adjustments based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank\ngroups. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, and for the years then ended, the Company adjusted\nits historical loss rates for the\ncommercial real estate portfolio segment based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank groups.\nThe estimated loan loss allocation for all five loan portfolio segments is then adjusted for management's\nestimate of\nprobable losses for several qualitative and environmental\u201d factors.\nThe allocation for qualitative and environmental\nfactors is particularly subjective and does not lend itself to exact mathematical calculation.\nThis amount represents\nestimated probable inherent credit losses which exist, but have not yet been identified, as of\nthe balance sheet date, and are\nbased upon quarterly trend assessments in delinquent and nonaccrual loans, credit\nconcentration changes, prevailing\neconomic conditions, changes in lending personnel experience, changes in lending\npolicies or procedures and other\ninfluencing factors.\nThese qualitative and environmental factors are considered for each of the five loan segments\nand the\nallowance allocation, as determined by the processes noted above, is increased or\ndecreased based on the incremental\nassessment of these factors.\nThe Company regularly re-evaluates its practices in determining the allowance\nfor loan losses. Since the fourth quarter of\n2016, the Company has increased its look-back period each quarter to incorporate\nthe effects of at least one economic\ndownturn in its loss history. The Company believes\nthe extension of its look-back period is appropriate due to the risks\ninherent in the loan portfolio. Absent this extension, the early cycle periods in\nwhich the Company experienced significant\nlosses would be excluded from the determination of the allowance for loan losses and its balance\nwould decrease. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, the Company increased its look-back period to\n51 quarters to continue to include losses\nincurred by the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2009. The Company\nwill likely continue to increase its look-\nback period to incorporate the effects of at least one economic downturn in\nits loss history. During 2020,\nthe Company\nadjusted certain qualitative and economic factors related to changes in economic conditions\ndriven by the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions, including\nhigher unemployment in our primary market\narea.\nDuring 2021, the Company adjusted certain qualitative and economic factors to reflect\nimprovements in economic\nconditions in our primary market area.\nFurther adjustments may be made in the future as a result of the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic.\nAssessment for Other-Than-Temporary\nImpairment of Securities\nOn a quarterly basis, management makes an assessment to determine\nwhether there have been events or economic\ncircumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is other-than-temporarily\nimpaired.\nFor debt securities with an unrealized loss, an other-than-temporary\nimpairment write-down is triggered when (1) the\nCompany has the intent to sell a debt security,\n(2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the\ndebt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) the Company does not expect\nto recover the entire amortized\ncost basis of the debt security.\nIf the Company has the intent to sell a debt security or if it is more likely than not that it\nwill\nbe required to sell the debt security before recovery,\nthe other-than-temporary write-down is equal to the entire difference\nbetween the debt security's amortized cost\nand its fair value.\nIf the Company does not intend to sell the security or it is not\nmore likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery,\nthe other-than-temporary impairment write-\ndown is separated into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due\nto all other factors.\nThe\ncredit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between\nthe security's amortized cost basis and\nthe\npresent value of its expected future cash flows.\nThe remaining difference between the security's\nfair value and the present\nvalue of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome, net of applicable taxes.\nThe Company is required to own certain stock as a condition of membership, such as\nFederal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d)\nand Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d).\nThese non-marketable equity securities are accounted for at cost\nwhich equals par or\nredemption value.\nThese securities do not have a readily determinable fair value as their ownership is restricted and\nthere is\nno market for these securities.\nThe Company records these non-marketable equity securities as a component\nof other\nassets, which are periodically evaluated for impairment. Management considers\nthese non-marketable equity securities to\nbe long-term investments. Accordingly,\nwhen evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers\nthe\nultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in\nvalue.\nFair Value\nDetermination\nU.S. GAAP requires management to value and disclose certain of the Company's\nassets and liabilities at fair value,\nincluding investments classified as available-for-sale and derivatives.\nASC 820,\nFair Value\nMeasurements and Disclosures\n,\nwhich defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP and expands\ndisclosures about fair value measurements.\nFor more information regarding fair value measurements and disclosures,\nplease refer to Note 14, Fair Value,\nof the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.\nFair values are based on active market prices of identical assets or liabilities when available.\nComparable assets or\nliabilities or a composite of comparable assets in active markets are used when identical assets\nor liabilities do not have\nreadily available active market pricing.\nHowever, some of the Company's\nassets or liabilities lack an available or\ncomparable trading market characterized by frequent transactions between\nwilling buyers and sellers. In these cases, fair\nvalue is estimated using pricing models that use discounted cash flows and\nother pricing techniques. Pricing models and\ntheir underlying assumptions are based upon management's\nbest estimates for appropriate discount rates, default rates,\nprepayments, market volatility and other factors, taking into account current observable\nmarket data and experience.\nThese assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported\nfair values of assets and liabilities and the related income\nand expense. As such, the use of different models and assumptions, as\nwell as changes in market conditions, could result in\nmaterially different net earnings and retained earnings results.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned ( OREO\u201d), consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or\nin satisfaction of loans and is\nreported at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell at the date acquired with any loss\nrecognized as a\ncharge-off through the allowance for loan losses. Additional\nOREO losses for subsequent valuation adjustments are\ndetermined on a specific property basis and are included as a component of other noninterest\nexpense along with holding\ncosts. Any gains or losses on disposal of OREO are also reflected in noninterest expense.\nSignificant judgments and\ncomplex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of OREO, and the period of time\nwithin which such estimates\ncan be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of\nmarket volatility. As a result, the net proceeds\nrealized from sales transactions could differ significantly from\nappraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to\ndetermine the fair value of OREO.\nDeferred Tax\nAsset Valuation\nA valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of available\nevidence, it is more-likely-\nthan-not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The\nultimate realization of deferred tax assets\nis dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods\nin which those temporary differences become\ndeductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred\ntax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax\nplanning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of taxable income over\nthe last three years and\nprojections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are\ndeductible, management believes\nit is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences\nat December 31, 2021. The amount\nof the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however,\ncould be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are\nreduced.\nAverage Balance\nSheet and Interest Rates\nYear ended December 31\nAverage\nYield/\nAverage\nYield/\n(Dollars in thousands)\nBalance\nRate\nBalance\nRate\nLoans and loans held for sale\n$\n459,712\n4.45%\n$\n465,378\n4.74%\nSecurities - taxable\n320,766\n1.28%\n234,420\n1.68%\nSecurities - tax-exempt (a)\n62,736\n3.57%\n63,029\n3.72%\nTotal securities\n383,502\n1.66%\n297,449\n2.11%\nFederal funds sold\n38,659\n0.15%\n30,977\n0.41%\nInterest bearing bank deposits\n77,220\n0.13%\n56,104\n0.41%\nTotal interest-earning assets\n959,093\n2.81%\n849,908\n3.38%\nDeposits:\nNOW\n178,197\n0.12%\n154,431\n0.34%\nSavings and money market\n296,708\n0.22%\n242,485\n0.44%\nCertificates of deposits\n159,111\n1.03%\n165,120\n1.36%\nTotal interest-bearing deposits\n634,016\n0.39%\n562,036\n0.68%\nShort-term borrowings\n3,349\n0.51%\n1,864\n0.48%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n637,365\n0.39%\n563,900\n0.68%\nNet interest income and margin (a)\n$\n24,460\n2.55%\n$\n24,830\n2.92%\n(a) Tax-equivalent.\nSee \"Table 1 - Explanation of Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures\".\nRESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nNet interest income (tax-equivalent) was $24.5 million in 2021, compared\nto $24.8 million in 2020.\nThis decrease was due\nto a decline in the Company's net interest\nmargin (tax-equivalent),\npartially offset by balance sheet growth.\nThe tax-equivalent yield on total interest-earning assets decreased by 57 basis points\nin 2021 from 2020 to 2.81%.\nThis\ndecrease was primarily due to the lower rate environment and changes in our asset\nmix from the significant increase in\ndeposits from government stimulus and relief programs and customers' increased savings.\nThe cost of total interest-bearing liabilities decreased 29 basis points to 0.39%\nin 2021 compared to 0.68 in 2020.\nThe net\ndecrease in our funding costs was primarily due to lower prevailing market interest rates.\nOur funding costs declined less\nthan the rates earned on our interest earning assets.\nThe Company continues to deploy various asset liability management strategies\nto manage its risk to interest rate\nfluctuations. The Company's\nnet interest margin could experience pressure due to reduced earning asset\nyields and\nincreased competition for quality loan opportunities.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to provide\nan allowance for loan losses that\nmanagement believes, based on its processes and estimates, should be adequate\nto provide for the probable losses on\noutstanding loans. The Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.6\nmillion during 2021, compared to\n$1.1 million in provision for loan losses during 2020.\nThe negative provision for loan losses was primarily related to\nimprovements in economic conditions in our primary market area.\nThe provision for loan losses is based upon various\nfactors, including the absolute level of loans, loan growth, the credit quality,\nand the amount of net charge-offs or\nrecoveries.\nBased upon its assessment of the loan portfolio, management adjusts the allowance\nfor loan losses to an amount it believes\nshould be appropriate to adequately cover its estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio.\nThe Company's allowance\nfor loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.08% at December 31, 2021, compared\nto 1.22% at December 31, 2020.\nExcluding PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the SBA, the Company's\nallowance for loan losses was 1.10% and 1.27% of\ntotal loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWhile the policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance\nfor loan losses, as well as the resulting provision for loan losses charged to operations,\nare considered adequate by\nmanagement and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators, they are based on estimates\nand judgments and are\ntherefore approximate and imprecise. Factors beyond our control (such as conditions\nin the local and national economy,\nlocal real estate markets, or industries) may have a material adverse effect\non our asset quality and the adequacy of our\nallowance for loan losses resulting in significant increases in the provision\nfor loan losses.\nNoninterest Income\nYear ended December 31\n(Dollars in thousands)\nService charges on deposit accounts\n$\n$\nMortgage lending\n1,547\n2,319\nBank-owned life insurance\nSecurities gains, net\nOther\n1,757\n1,644\nTotal noninterest income\n$\n4,288\n$\n5,375\nThe decrease in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily driven by a decline\nin consumer spending activity as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company's income from mortgage lending\nis primarily attributable to the (1) origination and sale of new mortgage\nloans and (2) servicing of mortgage loans. Origination income, net, is comprised of gains\nor losses from the sale of the\nmortgage loans originated, origination fees, underwriting fees and other fees associated\nwith the origination of loans, which\nare netted against the commission expense associated with these originations. The\nCompany's normal practice is to\noriginate mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market and to either sell or\nretain the MSRs when the loan is sold.\nMSRs are recognized based on the fair value of the servicing right on the date the corresponding\nmortgage loan is sold.\nSubsequent to the date of transfer, the Company\nhas elected to measure its MSRs under the amortization method.\nServicing\nfee income is reported net of any related amortization expense.\nThe Company evaluates MSRs for impairment on a quarterly basis.\nImpairment is determined by grouping MSRs by\ncommon predominant characteristics, such as interest rate and loan type.\nIf the aggregate carrying amount of a particular\ngroup of MSRs exceeds the group's aggregate fair\nvalue, a valuation allowance for that group is established.\nThe valuation\nallowance is adjusted as the fair value changes.\nAn increase in mortgage interest rates typically results in an increase in the\nfair value of the MSRs while a decrease in mortgage interest rates typically results in a decrease\nin the fair value of MSRs.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the Company's\nmortgage lending income for 2021 and 2020.\nYear ended December 31\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOrigination income\n$\n1,417\n$\n2,300\nServicing fees, net\nTotal mortgage lending income\n$\n1,547\n$\n2,319\nThe Company's income from mortgage lending\ntypically fluctuates as mortgage interest rates change and is primarily\nattributable to the origination and sale of new mortgage loans. Origination income\ndecreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due\nto a decrease in refinance activity in our primary market.\nThe decrease in origination income was partially offset by an\nincrease in servicing fees, net of related amortization expense as prepayment\nspeeds slowed during 2021, resulting in\ndecreased amortization expense.\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance decreased primarily due to $0.3\nmillion in non-taxable death benefits received in\n2020. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers\nand the income we receive (i.e.,\nincreases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies and death benefits received)\non these policies is dependent\nupon the returns the insurance carriers are able to earn on the underlying investments that\nsupport these policies.

For more information regarding changes\nin accounting estimates, please refer to Note\n1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements\nthat accompany this report.\nThe increase in FDIC and other regulatory assessments was primarily due to the expiration\nof FDIC assessment credits\nduring 2020 and an increased assessment base during 2021.\nIncome Tax\nExpense\nIncome tax expense was $1.4 million in 2021 and $1.6 million in 2020.\nThe Company's effective income\ntax rate was\n14.89% in 2021, compared to 17.72% in 2020.\nThis change was primarily due to an income tax benefit related to a New\nMarkets Tax Credit investment\nfunded in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe Company's effective income\ntax rate is\nprincipally impacted by tax-exempt earnings from the Company's\ninvestments in municipal securities, bank-owned life\ninsurance, and New Markets Tax\nCredits.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nSecurities\nSecurities available-for-sale were $421.9\nmillion at December 31, 2021, compared to $335.2 million at December 31, 2020.\nThis increase reflects an increase in the amortized cost basis of securities available-for-sale\nof $95.7 million, and a decrease\nof $9.0 million in the fair value of securities available-for-sale.\nThe increase in the amortized cost basis of securities\navailable-for-sale was primarily attributable to management\nallocating more funding to the investment portfolio following\nthe significant increases in customer deposits. The decrease in the fair value of securities\nwas primarily due to an increase\nin long-term interest rates. The average annualized tax-equivalent\nyields earned on total securities were 1.66%\nin 2021 and\n2.11%\nin 2020.\nThe following table shows the carrying value and weighted average yield of securities available\n-for-sale as of December\n31, 2021 according to contractual maturity.\nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of mortgage-backed\nsecurities ( MBS\u201d) because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called\nor prepaid with or without penalty.\nDecember 31, 2021\n1 year\n1 to 5\n5 to 10\nAfter 10\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands)\nor less\nyears\nyears\nyears\nFair Value\nAgency obligations\n$\n5,007\n49,604\n69,802\n-\n124,413\nAgency MBS\n-\n35,855\n186,836\n223,371\nState and political subdivisions\n15,743\n57,547\n74,107\nTotal available-for-sale\n$\n5,177\n50,931\n121,400\n244,383\n421,891\nWeighted average yield (1):\nAgency obligations\n2.00%\n1.36%\n1.31%\n-\n1.36%\nAgency MBS\n-\n3.42%\n1.48%\n1.34%\n1.37%\nState and political subdivisions\n4.25%\n2.85%\n2.18%\n2.77%\n2.64%\nTotal available-for-sale\n2.07%\n1.40%\n1.47%\n1.68%\n1.59%\n(1) Yields are calculated based on amortized cost.\nLoans\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n83,977\n82,585\nConstruction and land development\n32,432\n33,514\nCommercial real estate\n258,371\n255,136\nResidential real estate\n77,661\n84,154\nConsumer installment\n6,682\n7,099\nTotal loans\n459,123\n462,488\nLess:\nunearned income\n(759)\n(788)\nLoans, net of unearned income\n$\n458,364\n461,700\nTotal loans, net of unearned income,\nwere $458.4 million at December 31, 2021, and $461.7 million at December\n31, 2020.\nExcluding PPP loans, total loans, net of unearned income, were $450.5\nmillion, an increase of $7.5 million, or 2% from\nDecember 31, 2020.\nThis increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial and industrial loans\n,\nnet of PPP,\nof\n$12.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in residential real estate loans of\n$6.5 million, as lower rates increased refinance\nactivity and payoffs for consumer mortgage loans.\nFour loan categories represented the majority of the loan portfolio at\nDecember 31, 2021: commercial real estate (56%), residential real estate (17%),\ncommercial and industrial (18%) and\nconstruction and land development (7%).\nApproximately 25% of the Company's commercial\nreal estate loans were\nclassified as owner-occupied at December 31, 2021.\nWithin the residential real estate portfolio\nsegment, the Company had junior lien mortgages of approximately $7.2 million,\nor 2%, and $8.7 million, or 2%, of total loans, net of unearned income at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor\nresidential real estate mortgage loans with a consumer purpose, the Company\nhad no loans that required interest only\npayments at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company's\nresidential real estate mortgage portfolio does not include any\noption ARM loans, subprime loans, or any material amount of other high-risk consumer\nmortgage products.\nThe average yield earned on loans and loans held for sale was 4.45% in 2021\nand 4.74% in 2020.\nThe specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio include,\nbut are not limited to, the effects of\ncurrent economic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic's\neffects, on our borrowers' cash flows, real estate market\nsales volumes, valuations, availability and cost of financing properties,\nreal estate industry concentrations, competitive\npressures from a wide range of other lenders, deterioration in certain credits, interest rate\nfluctuations, reduced collateral\nvalues or non-existent collateral, title defects, inaccurate appraisals, financial deterioration\nof borrowers, fraud, and any\nviolation of applicable laws and regulations.\nThe Company attempts to reduce these economic and credit risks through its loan-to-value\nguidelines for collateralized\nloans, investigating the creditworthiness of borrowers and monitoring borrowers' financial\nposition. Also, we have\nestablished and periodically review,\nlending policies and procedures. Banking regulations limit a bank's\ncredit exposure by\nprohibiting unsecured loan relationships that exceed 10% of its capital; or 20%\nof capital, if loans in excess of 10% of\ncapital are fully secured. Under these regulations, we are prohibited from having secured\nloan relationships in excess of\napproximately $21.0 million. Furthermore, we have an internal limit\nfor aggregate credit exposure (loans outstanding plus\nunfunded commitments) to a single borrower of $18.9\nmillion. Our loan policy requires that the Loan Committee of the\nBoard of Directors approve any loan relationships that exceed this internal limit.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bank had no\nrelationships exceeding these limits.\nWe periodically analyze\nour commercial loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit\nrisk exists in any one or\nmore industries. We\nuse classification systems broadly accepted by the financial services industry in\norder to categorize our\ncommercial borrowers. Loan concentrations to borrowers in the following classes\nexceeded 25% of the Bank's total risk-\nbased capital at December 31, 2021 (and related balances at December 31,\n2020).\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nLessors of 1-4 family residential properties\n$\n47,880\n$\n49,127\nHotel/motel\n43,856\n42,900\nMulti-family residential properties\n42,587\n40,203\nShopping centers\n29,574\n30,000\nIn light of disruptions in economic conditions caused by COVID-19, the financial regulators\nhave issued guidance\nencouraging banks to work constructively with borrowers affected\nby the virus in our community.\nThis guidance, including\nthe Interagency Statement on COVID-19 Loan Modifications and the Interagency Examiner\nGuidance for Assessing Safety\nand Soundness Considering the Effect of the COVID-19\nPandemic on Institutions, provides that the agencies will not\ncriticize financial institutions that mitigate credit risk through prudent actions\nconsistent with safe and sound practices.\nSpecifically, examiners\nwill not criticize institutions for working with borrowers as part of a risk\nmitigation strategy\nintended to improve existing loans, even if the restructured loans have or develop\nweaknesses that ultimately result in\nadverse credit classification.\nUpon demonstrating the need for payment relief, the bank will work with qualified borrowers\nthat were otherwise current before the pandemic to determine the most appropriate\ndeferral option.\nFor residential\nmortgage and consumer loans the borrower may elect to defer payments for up to three\nmonths.\nInterest continues to\naccrue and the amount due at maturity increases.\nCommercial real estate, commercial, and small business borrowers may\nelect to defer payments for up to three months or pay scheduled interest payments for a\nsix-month period.\nThe bank\nrecognizes that a combination of the payment relief options may be prudent dependent\non a borrower's business type.\nAs\nof December 31, 2021, we had one COVID-19 loan deferral totaling $0.1\nmillion, compared to $32.3 million, or 7% of total\nloans at December 31, 2020.\nThe tables below provide information concerning the composition of these COVID-19\nmodifications as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020.\nCOVID-19 Modifications\nModification Types\n(Dollars in thousands)\n# of Loans\nModified\nBalance\n% of Portfolio\nModified\nInterest Only\nPayment\nP&I\nPayments\nDeferred\nDecember 31, 2021:\nResidential real estate\n$\n-\n-\n%\nTotal\n$\n-\n%\n-\n%\n%\nDecember 31, 2020:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n-\n%\n%\n-\n%\nCommercial real estate\n31,399\n-\nResidential real estate\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n32,273\n%\n%\n%\nCOVID-19 Modifications within Commercial Real Estate\nSegment\n(Dollars in thousands)\n# of Loans\nModified\nBalance of\nLoans Modified\n% of Total\nLoan Class\nDecember 31, 2020:\nHotel/motel\n$\n26,427\n%\nMultifamily\n3,530\nRestaurants\n1,442\nThere were no COVID-19 modifications within the commercial real estate segment at December\n31, 2021.\nSection 4013 of the CARES Act provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law\nfrom classification as a TDR\npursuant to GAAP.\nIn addition, the Interagency Statement on COVID-19 Loan Modifications provides\ncircumstances in\nwhich a loan modification is not subject to classification as a TDR if such loan is not eligible\nfor modification under\nSection 4013.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes\nappropriate to adequately cover\nthe Company's estimate of probable\nlosses inherent in the loan portfolio.

The ratio of our\nallowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding was 1.08% at December 31,\n2021, compared to 1.22% at December 31,\n2020.\nExcluding PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the SBA, the Company's\nallowance for loan losses was 1.10% and\n1.27% of total loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn the future, the allowance to total loans outstanding\nratio will increase or decrease to the extent the factors that influence our quarterly allowance\nassessment, including the\nduration and magnitude of COVID-19 effects, in their entirety either improve\nor weaken.\nIn addition our regulators, as an\nintegral part of their examination process, will periodically review the Company's\nallowance for loan losses, and may\nrequire the Company to make additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses based\non their judgment about\ninformation available to them at the time of their examinations.\nNonperforming Assets\nAt December 31, 2021 the Company had $0.8\nmillion in nonperforming assets compared to $0.5\nmillion at December 31,\n2020.\nThe table below provides information concerning total nonperforming assets\nand certain asset quality ratios.\nDecember 31\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNonperforming assets:\nNonperforming (nonaccrual) loans\n$\nOther real estate owned\n-\nTotal nonperforming assets\n$\nas a % of loans and other real estate owned\n0.18\n%\n0.12\nas a % of total assets\n0.07\n%\n0.06\nNonperforming loans as a % of total loans\n0.10\n%\n0.12\nAccruing loans 90 days or more past due\n$\n-\nThe table below provides information concerning the composition of nonaccrual\nloans at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nNonaccrual loans:\nCommercial real estate\n$\nResidential real estate\nTotal nonaccrual loans /\nnonperforming loans\n$\nThe Company discontinues the accrual of interest income when (1) there is a significant\ndeterioration in the financial\ncondition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected or\n(2) the principal or interest is more\nthan 90 days past due, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection.\nAt December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively, the Company\nhad $0.4\nmillion and $0.5\nmillion in loans on nonaccrual.\nAt December 31, 2021 there were no loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest, compared\nto $0.1 million at\nDecember 31, 2020.\nThe table below provides information concerning the composition of OREO at December\n31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nOther real estate owned:\nCommercial real estate\n$\n-\nTotal other real estate owned\n$\n-\nPotential Problem Loans\nPotential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and\nwhere information about possible credit\nproblems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the\nborrower's ability to comply with present\nrepayment terms.\nThis definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards\nestablished by the Federal\nReserve, the Company's primary regulator,\nfor loans classified as substandard, excluding nonaccrual loans.\nPotential\nproblem loans, which are not included in nonperforming assets, amounted to $2.4\nmillion, or 0.5% of total loans at\nDecember 31, 2021, compared to $2.9 million, or 1.0% of total loans at December 31, 2020.\nThe table below provides information concerning the composition of potential problem\nloans at December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively.\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nPotential problem loans:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\nConstruction and land development\nCommercial real estate\nResidential real estate\n1,748\n2,229\nConsumer installment\nTotal potential problem loans\n$\n2,360\n2,912\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately $0.3\nmillion or 14.2% of total potential problem loans were past due at least 30 but\nless than 90 days.\nThe following table is a summary of the Company's\nperforming loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than\n90 days as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nPerforming loans past due 30 to 89 days:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\nConstruction and land development\nCommercial real estate\n-\nResidential real estate\n1,509\nConsumer installment\nTotal performing loans past due\n30 to 89 days\n$\n1,858\nDeposits\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nNoninterest bearing demand\n$\n316,132\n245,398\nNOW\n183,021\n155,870\nMoney market\n244,195\n199,937\nSavings\n91,245\n78,187\nCertificates of deposit under $250,000\n101,660\n105,357\nCertificates of deposit and other time deposits of $250,000 or more\n57,990\n55,044\nTotal deposits\n$\n994,243\n839,793\nTotal deposits increased\n$154.5 million, or 18%, to $994.2 million at December 31, 2021,\ncompared to $839.8 million at\nDecember 31, 2020.

The rules included\nthe implementation of a\ncapital conservation buffer that is added to the minimum requirements\nfor capital adequacy purposes. The capital\nconservation buffer was subject to a three year phase-in period\nthat began on January 1, 2016 and was fully phased-in on\nJanuary 1, 2019 at 2.5%. A banking organization with a conservation buffer\nof less than the required amount will be subject\nto limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary\nbonus payments to executive\nofficers. At December 31, 2021, the Bank's\nratio was sufficient to meet the fully phased-in conservation\nbuffer.\nEffective March 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve and the other federal\nbanking regulators adopted an interim final rule that\namended the capital conservation buffer.\nThe interim final rule was adopted as a final rule on August 26, 2020. The\nnew\nrule revises the definition of eligible retained income\u201d for purposes of the maximum payout\nratio to allow banking\norganizations to more freely use their capital buffers to promote\nlending and other financial intermediation activities, by\nmaking the limitations on capital distributions more gradual. The\neligible retained income is now the greater of (i) net\nincome for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects\nnot reflected in net income; and (ii)\nthe average of all net income over the preceding four quarters. The interim\nfinal rule only affects the capital buffers, and\nbanking organizations were encouraged to make prudent capital\ndistribution decisions.\nThe Federal Reserve has treated us as a small bank holding company' under the Federal\nReserve's policy.\nAccordingly,\nour capital adequacy is evaluated at the Bank level, and not for the Company and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. The Bank's\ntier 1 leverage ratio was 9.35%, CET1 risk-based capital ratio was 16.23%, tier 1 risk-based\ncapital ratio was 16.23%, and\ntotal risk-based capital ratio was 17.06%\nat December 31, 2021. These ratios exceed the minimum regulatory capital\npercentages of 5.0% for tier 1 leverage ratio, 6.5% for CET1 risk-based capital ratio,\n8.0% for tier 1 risk-based capital ratio,\nand 10.0% for total risk-based capital ratio to be considered well capitalized.\u201d\nThe Bank's capital conservation buffer\nwas\n9.06%\nat December 31, 2021.\nMARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT\nManagement's objective is to manage assets and\nliabilities to provide a satisfactory,\nconsistent level of profitability within\nthe framework of established liquidity,\nloan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. The Bank's\nAsset Liability\nManagement Committee ( ALCO\u201d) is charged with the responsibility\nof monitoring these policies, which are designed to\nensure an acceptable asset/liability composition. Two\ncritical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate risk and liquidity\nrisk management.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to market risk arising from\nfluctuations in interest rates because\nassets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. For example,\nif liabilities reprice faster than assets, and\ninterest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially decline. In addition, assets\nand liabilities may reprice at the same\ntime but by different amounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates is rising,\nthe Company may increase\nrates paid on interest bearing demand deposit accounts and savings deposit\naccounts by an amount that is less than the\ngeneral increase in market interest rates. Also, short-term and long-term\nmarket interest rates may change by different\namounts. For example, a flattening yield curve may reduce the interest spread\nbetween new loan yields and funding costs.\nFurther, the remaining maturity of various assets and\nliabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For\nexample, if long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply,\nmortgage-backed securities in the securities portfolio may\nprepay earlier than anticipated, which could reduce earnings. Interest rates may also\nhave a direct or indirect effect on loan\ndemand, loan losses, mortgage origination volume, the fair value of MSRs and other\nitems affecting earnings.\nALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands\nfor various types of loans and\ndeposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and\noff-balance sheet items. Measurements\nused to help manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation and an economic\nvalue of equity model.\nEarnings simulation\n. Management believes that interest rate risk is best estimated by our earnings simulation\nmodeling.\nOn at least a quarterly basis, the following 12 month time period is simulated to determine a\nbaseline net interest income\nforecast and the sensitivity of this forecast to changes in interest rates. The baseline forecast\nassumes an unchanged or flat\ninterest rate environment. Forecasted levels of earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities,\nand off-balance sheet financial\ninstruments are combined with ALCO forecasts of market interest rates for\nthe next 12 months and other factors in order to\nproduce various earnings simulations and estimates.\nTo help limit interest rate risk,\nwe have guidelines for earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest\nincome from gradual changes in interest rates.\nFor changes up or down in rates from management's\nflat interest rate\nforecast over the next 12 months, policy limits for net interest income variances are as follows:\n+/- 20% for a gradual change of 400 basis points\n+/- 15% for a gradual change of 300 basis points\n+/- 10% for a gradual change of 200 basis points\n+/- 5% for a gradual change of 100 basis points\nThe following table reports the variance of net interest income over the next 12\nmonths assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates up or down when compared to the baseline net interest income\nforecast at December 31, 2021.\nChanges in Interest Rates\nNet Interest Income % Variance\n400 basis points\n7.92\n%\n300 basis points\n5.61\n200 basis points\n3.59\n100 basis points\n1.54\n(100) basis points\n(0.44)\n(200) basis points\nNM\n(300) basis points\nNM\n(400) basis points\nNM\nNM=not meaningful\nAt December 31, 2021, our earnings simulation model indicated that\nwe were in compliance with the policy guidelines\nnoted above.\nEconomic Value\nof Equity\nEconomic value of equity ( EVE\u201d) measures the extent that estimated econom\nic values of our assets, liabilities and off-\nbalance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are\nestimated by discounting expected\ncash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items,\nwhich establishes a base case EVE. In contrast with our\nearnings simulation model which evaluates interest rate risk over a 12\nmonth timeframe, EVE uses a terminal horizon\nwhich allows for the re-pricing of all assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items.\nFurther, EVE is measured using values\nas of a point in time and does not reflect any actions that ALCO might take in responding to\nor anticipating changes in\ninterest rates, or market and competitive conditions.\nTo help limit interest rate risk,\nwe have stated policy guidelines for an instantaneous basis point change in interest rates,\nsuch that our EVE should not decrease from our base case by more than the following:\n45% for an instantaneous change of +/- 400 basis points\n35% for an instantaneous change of +/- 300 basis points\n25% for an instantaneous change of +/- 200 basis points\n15% for an instantaneous change of +/- 100 basis points\nThe following table reports the variance of EVE assuming an immediate change in\ninterest rates up or down when\ncompared to the baseline EVE at December 31, 2021.\nChanges in Interest Rates\nEVE % Variance\n400 basis points\n(20.53)\n%\n300 basis points\n(14.14)\n200 basis points\n(8.35)\n100 basis points\n(3.23)\n(100) basis points\n0.91\n(200) basis points\nNM\n(300) basis points\nNM\n(400) basis points\nNM\nNM=not meaningful\nAt December 31, 2021, our EVE model indicated that we were in compliance\nwith the policy guidelines noted above.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest\nincome will be affected by\nchanges in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated\nwith interest-bearing liabilities\nmay not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition,\nthe magnitude and duration of changes in interest\nrates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain\nassets and liabilities may have\nsimilar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different\ndegrees to changes in market interest rates, and other\neconomic and market factors, including market perceptions.\nInterest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate\nin advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types of assets\nand liabilities may lag behind\nchanges in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate\nmortgage loans, have features (generally\nreferred to as interest rate caps and floors\u201d) which limit changes in interest rates.\nPrepayment and early withdrawal levels\nalso could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments.\nThe ability of many\nborrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates or\neconomic stress, which may\ndiffer across industries and economic sectors. ALCO reviews each of the\nabove interest rate sensitivity analyses along with\nseveral different interest rate scenarios in seeking satisfactory,\nconsistent levels of profitability within the framework of the\nCompany's established liquidity,\nloan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.\nThe Company may also use derivative financial instruments to improve the balance between\ninterest-sensitive assets and\ninterest-sensitive liabilities and as one tool to manage interest rate sensitivity\nwhile continuing to meet the credit and\ndeposit needs of our customers. From time to time, the Company may enter into\ninterest rate swaps ( swaps\u201d) to facilitate\ncustomer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives,\nbut are not designated as hedging\ninstruments. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no derivative\ncontracts to assist in managing interest rate\nsensitivity.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity is the Company's ability to convert\nassets into cash equivalents in order to meet daily cash flow requirements,\nprimarily for deposit withdrawals, loan demand and maturing obligations. Without\nproper management of its liquidity,\nthe\nCompany could experience higher costs of obtaining funds due to insufficient liquidity,\nwhile excessive liquidity can lead\nto a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative higher-yielding\ninvestment opportunities.\nLiquidity is managed at two levels. The first is the liquidity of the Company.\nThe second is the liquidity of the Bank. The\nmanagement of liquidity at both levels is essential, because the Company and the Bank are\nseparate and distinct legal\nentities with different funding needs and sources, and each are subject\nto regulatory guidelines and requirements. The\nCompany depends upon dividends from the Bank for liquidity to pay its operating expenses,\ndebt obligations and\ndividends. The Bank's payment of dividends depends\non its earnings, liquidity,\ncapital and the absence of any regulatory\nrestrictions.\nThe primary source of funding and liquidity for the Company has been dividends received\nfrom the Bank. If needed, the\nCompany could also issue common stock or other securities. Primary uses of funds by the\nCompany include dividends paid\nto stockholders and stock repurchases.\nPrimary sources of funding for the Bank include customer deposits, other borrowings,\nrepayment and maturity of securities,\nand sale and repayment of loans.\nThe Bank has access to federal funds lines from various banks and borrowings\nfrom the\nFederal Reserve discount window.\nIn addition to these sources, the Bank has participated in the FHLB's advance program\nto obtain funding for its growth. Advances include both fixed and variable terms and\nare taken out with varying maturities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Bank had a remaining available line of credit with the FHLB\ntotaling $319.6 million.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Bank also had $41.0 million of federal funds lines, with none outstanding.\nPrimary uses of funds\ninclude repayment of maturing obligations and growing the loan portfolio.\nThe following table presents additional information about our contractual obligations\nas of December 31, 2021, which by\ntheir terms had contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December\n31, 2021:\nPayments due by period\n1 year\n1 to 3\n3 to 5\nMore than\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTotal\nor less\nyears\nyears\n5 years\nContractual obligations:\nDeposit maturities (1)\n$\n994,243\n948,364\n37,905\n7,785\nOperating lease obligations\nTotal\n$\n994,853\n948,484\n38,144\n7,926\n(1) Deposits with no stated maturity (demand, NOW, money market, and savings deposits) are\npresented in the \"1 year or less\" column\nManagement believes that the Company and the Bank have adequate sources of liquidity to\nmeet all known contractual\nobligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower,\ndepositor, and creditor\nrequirements over the next 12 months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bank had outstanding standby letters of credit of $1.\nmillion and unfunded loan commitments\noutstanding of $71.0 million. Because these commitments generally\nhave fixed expiration dates and many will expire\nwithout being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future\ncash requirements. If needed to\nfund these outstanding commitments, the Bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds\nsold or securities available-for-sale,\nor on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial\ninstitutions.\nResidential mortgage lending and servicing activities\nWe primarily sell conforming\nresidential mortgage loans in the secondary market to Fannie Mae\nwhile retaining the\nservicing of these loans. The sale agreements for these residential mortgage loans with\nFannie Mae and other investors\ninclude various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics\nof the residential mortgage\nloans. Although the representations and warranties vary among investors, they typically\ncover ownership of the loan,\nvalidity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing\nthe loan,\ncompliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, compliance with applicable\nfederal, state, and local\nlaws, among other matters.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans,\nwhich we have originated and sold,\nbut retained the servicing rights was $252.7 million. Although these loans are\ngenerally sold on a non-recourse basis,\nexcept for breaches of customary seller representations and warranties,\nwe may have to repurchase residential mortgage\nloans in cases where we breach such representations or warranties or the other terms of\nthe sale, such as where we fail to\ndeliver required documents or the documents we deliver are defective. Investors also\nmay require the repurchase of a\nmortgage loan when an early payment default underwriting review reveals significant\nunderwriting deficiencies, even if the\nmortgage loan has subsequently been brought current. Repurchase demands are typically\nreviewed on an individual loan by\nloan basis to validate the claims made by the investor and to determine if a contractually\nrequired repurchase event has\noccurred. We\nseek to reduce and manage the risks of potential repurchases or other claims by mortgage loan investors\nthrough our underwriting, quality assurance and servicing practices, including\ngood communications with our residential\nmortgage investors.\nThe Company was not required to repurchase any loans during 2021 and 2020\nas a result of representation and warranty\nprovisions contained in the Company's sale agreements\nwith Fannie Mae, and had no pending repurchase or make-whole\nrequests at December 31, 2021.\nWe service all residential\nmortgage loans originated and sold by us to Fannie Mae. As servicer,\nour primary duties are to:\n(1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments\nof principal and interest; (3) maintain\nand administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to\nthe mortgage loans; (4) maintain any\nrequired escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments;\nand (5) foreclose on\ndefaulted mortgage loans or take other actions to mitigate the potential losses to investors\nconsistent with the agreements\ngoverning our rights and duties as servicer.\nThe agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a\nstandard of responsibility for actions taken by us in\nsuch capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by us\nwhen acting in compliance with the\nrespective servicing agreements. However, if\nwe commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer,\nwe may be subject\nto termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice. The\nstandards governing servicing and\nthe possible remedies for violations of such standards are determined by servicing\nguides issued by Fannie Mae as well as\nthe contract provisions established between Fannie Mae and the Bank.\nRemedies could include repurchase of an affected\nloan.\nAlthough to date repurchase requests related to representation and warranty provisions,\nand servicing activities have been\nlimited, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may increase in frequency\nif investors more aggressively\npursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans. As of December\n31, 2021, we believe that this exposure is\nnot material due to the historical level of repurchase requests and loss trends, the results of\nour quality control reviews, and\nthe fact that 99% of our residential mortgage loans serviced for Fannie Mae\nwere current as of such date. We\nmaintain\nongoing communications with our investors and will continue to evaluate this exposure\nby monitoring the level and number\nof repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in our investor portfolios.\nSection 4021 of the CARES Act allows borrowers under 1-to-4 family residential\nmortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae to\nrequest forbearance to the servicer after affirming that such borrower\nis experiencing financial hardships during the\nCOVID-19 emergency.\nExcept for vacant or abandoned properties, Fannie Mae servicers may not initiate\nforeclosures on\nsimilar procedures or related evictions or sales until December 31, 2020.\nThe forbearance period was extended, generally,\nto March 31, 2021.\nThe Bank sells mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and services these on an actual/actual\nbasis. As a result,\nthe Bank is not obligated to make any advances to Fannie Mae on principal and interest on\nsuch mortgage loans where the\nborrower is entitled to forbearance.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data\npresented herein have been prepared in\naccordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require\nthe measurement of financial position and\noperating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in\nthe relative purchasing power of money\nover time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities\nof a financial institution\nare monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a\nfinancial institution's performance\nthan the effects of general levels of inflation.\nCURRENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nThe following ASU has been issued by the FASB\nbut is not yet effective.\n\u25cf\nASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic\n326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments;\nInformation about this pronouncement is described in more detail below.\nASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic\n326): - Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial\nInstruments\n, amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and\navailable for sale debt\nsecurities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, the new standard eliminates the probable\ninitial recognition threshold in\ncurrent GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected\ncredit losses using a broader\nrange of information regarding past events, current conditions and forecasts assessing the\ncollectability of cash flows. The\nallowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized\ncost basis of the financial assets to\npresent the net amount expected to be collected. For available for sale debt securities, credit\nlosses should be measured in a\nmanner similar to current GAAP,\nhowever the new standard will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance\nrather than as a write-down. The new guidance affects entities holding\nfinancial assets and net investment in leases that are\nnot accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect\nloans, debt securities, trade receivables, net\ninvestments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables,\nand any other financial assets not\nexcluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. For public\nbusiness entities, the new guidance was\noriginally effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2019. The Company has\ndeveloped an implementation team that is following a general timeline. The\nteam has been working with an advisory\nconsultant, with whom a third-party software license has been purchased.\nThe Company's preliminary evaluation\nindicates\nthe provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 are expected to impact the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements, in particular\nthe level of the reserve for credit losses. The Company is continuing to evaluate the\nextent of the potential impact and\nexpects that portfolio composition and economic conditions at the time of adoption\nwill be a factor.

The purpose of this discussion is to provide\ninformation about our financial\ncondition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the\nconsolidated financial statements. The\nfollowing discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes\nincluded elsewhere herein. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking\nstatements, so you should\nrefer to Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company was incorporated in 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware and became a bank\nholding company after\nit acquired its Alabama predecessor,\nwhich was a bank holding company established in 1984. The Bank, the Company's\nprincipal subsidiary, is an Alabama\nstate-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System and has operated\ncontinuously since 1907. Both the Company and the Bank are headquartered\nin Auburn, Alabama. The Bank conducts its\nbusiness primarily in East Alabama, including Lee County and surrounding areas.\nThe Bank operates full-service branches\nin Auburn, Opelika, Notasulga and Valley,\nAlabama.\nThe Bank also operates loan production offices in Auburn and\nPhenix City, Alabama.\nSummary of Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nNet interest income (a)\n$\n24,460\n$\n24,830\nLess: tax-equivalent adjustment\nNet interest income (GAAP)\n23,990\n24,338\nNoninterest income\n4,288\n5,375\nTotal revenue\n28,278\n29,713\nProvision for loan losses\n(600)\n1,100\nNoninterest expense\n19,433\n19,554\nIncome tax expense\n1,406\n1,605\nNet earnings\n$\n8,039\n$\n7,454\nBasic and diluted net earnings per share\n$\n2.27\n$\n2.09\n(a) Tax-equivalent.\nSee \"Table 1 - Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nFinancial Summary\nThe Company's net earnings were $8.0\nmillion for the full year 2021, compared to $7.5 million for the full year 2020.\nBasic and diluted net earnings per share were $2.27 per share for the full year 2021,\ncompared to $2.09 per share for the full\nyear 2020.\nNet interest income (tax-equivalent) was $24.5\nmillion in 2021, a 1% decrease compared to $24.8 million in 2020. This\ndecrease was primarily due to net interest margin compression\n,\npartially offset by balance sheet growth.\nNet interest\nmargin (tax-equivalent) decreased to 2.55% in 2021,\ncompared to 2.92% in 2020, primarily due to the lower interest rate\nenvironment and changes in our asset mix resulting from the significant increase\nin deposits from government stimulus and\nrelief programs and customers' increased savings.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company's allowance\nfor loan losses was $4.9 million, or 1.08% of total loans, compared to\n$5.6 million, or 1.22%\nof total loans, at December 31, 2020.\nExcluding\nPaycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) loans, which\nare guaranteed by the SBA,\nthe Company's allowance for loan losses\nwas 1.10% and 1.27% of total loans at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively\n.\nThe Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.6\nmillion in 2021 compared\nto a charge of $1.1 million during 2020.\nThe negative provision for loan losses was primarily related to improvements in\neconomic conditions in our primary market area, and related improvements in our\nasset quality.\nThe provision for loan\nlosses is based upon various estimates and judgements, including the absolute level\nof loans, loan growth, credit quality and\nthe amount of net charge-offs.\nNet charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 0.02% in 2021\n,\ncompared to net\nrecoveries as a percent of average loans of 0.03% in 2020.\nNoninterest income was $4.3 million in 2021 compared to $5.4\nmillion in 2020.\nThe decrease was primarily due to a $0.8\nmillion decrease in mortgage lending income in 2021 as refinance activity declined\nin our primary market area and a $0.3\nmillion non-taxable death benefit from bank-owned life insurance received\nin 2020.\nNoninterest expense was $19.4\nmillion in 2021 compared to $19.6\nmillion in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a\nreduction of $0.8\nmillion in various expenses related to the redevelopment of the Company's\nheadquarters in downtown\nAuburn.\nThis decrease was mostly offset by increases in salaries and benefits expe\nnse of $0.4 million and a $0.2 million\nincrease in FDIC and other regulatory assessments during 2021.\nIncome tax expense was $1.4\nmillion in 2021 and $1.6 million in 2020 reflecting an effective tax rate of 14.89\n%\nand\n17.72%, respectively.\nThis decrease was primarily due to an income tax benefit related to a New Markets Tax\nCredit\ninvestment funded in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe Company's effective income\ntax rate is principally impacted by tax-\nexempt earnings from the Company's investments\nin municipal securities, bank-owned life insurance, and New Markets\nTax Credits.\nThe Company paid cash dividends of $1.04\nper share in 2021, an increase of 2% from 2020. At December 31, 2021, the\nBank's regulatory capital ratios\nwere well above the minimum amounts required to be well capitalized\u201d under current\nregulatory standards with a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.06%,\na tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.35% and common equity tier\n1 ( CET1\u201d) of 16.23% at December 31, 2021.\nCOVID-19 Impact Assessment\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has occurred in waves of different\nvariants since the first quarter of 2020.\nVaccines\nto protect\nagainst and/or reduce the severity of COVID-19 were widely introduced at the beginning\nof 2021.\nAt times, the pandemic\nhas severely restricted the level of economic activity in our markets. In response to the COVID\n-19 pandemic, the State of\nAlabama, and most other states, have taken preventative or protective actions to prevent the\nspread of the virus, including\nimposing restrictions on travel and business operations and a statewide mask mandate,\nadvising or requiring individuals to\nlimit or forego their time outside of their homes, limitations on gathering of people and social distancing,\nand causing\ntemporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. Though certain\nof these measures have been\nrelaxed or eliminated, especially as vaccination levels increased, such\nmeasures could be reestablished in cases of new\nwaves, especially a wave of a COVID-19 variant that is more resistant\nto existing vaccines.\nCOVID-19 has significantly affected local state, national and global\nhealth and economic activity and its future effects are\nuncertain and will depend on various factors, including, among others, the duration\nand scope of the pandemic, especially\nnew variants of the virus, effective vaccines and drug treatments, together\nwith governmental, regulatory and private sector\nresponses. COVID-19 has had continuing significant effects\non the economy, financial\nmarkets and our employees,\ncustomers and vendors. Our business, financial condition and results of operations\ngenerally rely upon the ability of our\nborrowers to make deposits and repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our\nsecured loans, market value,\nstability and liquidity and demand for loans and other products and services we offer,\nall of which are affected by the\npandemic.\nWe have implemented\na number of procedures in response to the pandemic to support the safety and well-being of our\nemployees, customers and shareholders.\n\u2022\nWe believe our business continuity\nplan has worked to provide essential banking services to our communities and\ncustomers, while protecting our employees' health.\nAs part of our efforts to exercise social distancing in\naccordance with the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and the Governor\nof the State of Alabama,\nstarting March 23, 2020, we limited branch lobby service to appointment only while continuing\nto operate our\nbranch drive-thru facilities and ATMs.\nAs permitted by state public health guidelines, on June 1, 2020, we re-\nopened some of our branch lobbies.\nIn 2021, we opened our remaining branch lobbies.\nWe continue to provide\nservices through our online and other electronic channels.\nIn addition, we maintain remote work access to help\nemployees stay at home while providing continuity of service.\n\u2022\nWe are focused on servicing\nthe financial needs of our commercial and consumer clients with extensions\nand\ndeferrals to loan customers effected by COVID-19, provided\nsuch customers were not more than 30 days past due\nat the time of the request; and\n\u2022\nWe\nwere an active PPP lender. PPP loans were forgivable,\nin whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll\nand other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP.\nThese loans carry a fixed rate of\n1.00% and a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans\nmade on or after June 5,\n2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part.\nPayments are deferred until either the date on which the Small Business\nAdministration ( SBA\u201d) remits the amount of forgiveness proceeds\nto the lender or the date that is 10 months after\nthe last day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness\nwithin that 10-month period.\nWe\nbelieve these loans and our participation in the program helped our customers and the communities\nwe serve.\nCOVID-19 has also had various economic effects, generally.\nThese include supply chain disruptions and manufacturing\ndelays, shortages of certain goods and services, reduced consumer expenditure on\nhospitality and travel, and migration from\nlarger urban centers to less populated areas and remote work.\nThe demand for single family housing has exceeded existing\nsupplies.\nWhen coupled with construction delays attributable to supply chain disruptions\nand worker shortages, these\nfactors have caused housing prices and apartment rents to increase, generally.\nStimulative monetary and fiscal policy,\nalong with shortages of certain goods and services, and rising petroleum and food prices\nhave led to the highest inflation in\ndecades.\nAlthough fiscal stimulus remains under consideration by the President and Congress,\nthe Federal Reserve is\nconsidering increasing its target interest rates and reducing its holding of\nsecurities to stem inflation.\nA summary of PPP loans extended during 2020 follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n# of SBA\nApproved\nMix\n$ of SBA\nApproved\nMix\nSBA Tier:\n$2 million to $10 million\n-\n-\n%\n$\n-\n-\n%\n$350,000 to less than $2 million\n14,691\nUp to $350,000\n21,784\nTotal\n%\n$\n36,475\n%\nWe collected\napproximately $1.5 million in fees related to our PPP loans during 2020.\nThrough December 31, 2021, we\nhave recognized all of these fees, net of related costs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had received payments and\nforgiveness on all PPP loans extended during 2020.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits,\nand Venues\nAct (the Economic Aid\nAct\u201d) was signed into law.

Other policies also require subjective judgment and assumptions\nand may accordingly impact our\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company assesses the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses prior\nto the end of each calendar quarter. The level of\nthe allowance is based upon management's\nevaluation of the loan portfolio, past loan loss experience, current asset quality\ntrends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect\na borrower's ability to repay (including\nthe timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral,\ncomposition of the loan portfolio, economic\nconditions, industry and peer bank loan loss rates and other pertinent factors, including regulatory\nrecommendations. This\nevaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the\namounts and timing of future cash flows\nexpected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. Loans are\ncharged off, in whole or\nin part, when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely.\nA loan may be partially charged-off\nafter a confirming event\u201d has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant\nto the terms of the loan is\nunlikely.\nThe Company deems loans impaired when, based on current information and events, it is\nprobable that the Company will\nbe unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.\nCollection of all amounts due\naccording to the contractual terms means that both the interest and principal payments of a\nloan will be collected as\nscheduled in the loan agreement.\nAn impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded\ninvestment in the loan. The\nimpairment is recognized through the allowance. Loans that are impaired are\nrecorded at the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows discounted at the loan's effective\ninterest rate, or if the loan is collateral dependent, impairment\nmeasurement is based on the fair value of the collateral, less estimated disposal costs.\nThe level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate\nto absorb probable losses inherent in the\nportfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged\nto expense and decreased by charge-\noffs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off.\nIn assessing the adequacy of the allowance, the Company also considers the results of its\nongoing internal, independent\nloan review process. The Company's loan\nreview process assists in determining whether there are loans in the portfolio\nwhose credit quality has weakened over time and evaluating the risk characteristics of the\nentire loan portfolio. The\nCompany's loan review process includes the judgment\nof management, the input from our independent loan reviewers, and\nreviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination\nprocess. The Company\nincorporates loan review results in the determination of whether or not it is probable\nthat it will be able to collect all\namounts due according to the contractual terms of a loan.\nAs part of the Company's quarterly assessment\nof the allowance, management divides the loan portfolio into five segments:\ncommercial and industrial, construction and land development, commercial real estate, residential\nreal estate, and consumer\ninstallment loans. The Company\nanalyzes each segment and estimates an allowance allocation for each loan\nsegment.\nThe allocation of the allowance for loan losses begins with a process of estimating the\nprobable losses inherent for these\ntypes of loans. The estimates for these loans are established by category and based\non the Company's internal system of\ncredit risk ratings and historical loss data. The estimated loan loss allocation rate for the Company's\ninternal system of\ncredit risk grades is based on its experience with similarly graded loans. For\nloan segments where the Company believes it\ndoes not have sufficient historical loss data, the Company may\nmake adjustments based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank\ngroups. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, and for the years then ended, the Company adjusted\nits historical loss rates for the\ncommercial real estate portfolio segment based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank groups.\nThe estimated loan loss allocation for all five loan portfolio segments is then adjusted for management's\nestimate of\nprobable losses for several qualitative and environmental\u201d factors.\nThe allocation for qualitative and environmental\nfactors is particularly subjective and does not lend itself to exact mathematical calculation.\nThis amount represents\nestimated probable inherent credit losses which exist, but have not yet been identified, as of\nthe balance sheet date, and are\nbased upon quarterly trend assessments in delinquent and nonaccrual loans, credit\nconcentration changes, prevailing\neconomic conditions, changes in lending personnel experience, changes in lending\npolicies or procedures and other\ninfluencing factors.\nThese qualitative and environmental factors are considered for each of the five loan segments\nand the\nallowance allocation, as determined by the processes noted above, is increased or\ndecreased based on the incremental\nassessment of these factors.\nThe Company regularly re-evaluates its practices in determining the allowance\nfor loan losses. Since the fourth quarter of\n2016, the Company has increased its look-back period each quarter to incorporate\nthe effects of at least one economic\ndownturn in its loss history. The Company believes\nthe extension of its look-back period is appropriate due to the risks\ninherent in the loan portfolio. Absent this extension, the early cycle periods in\nwhich the Company experienced significant\nlosses would be excluded from the determination of the allowance for loan losses and its balance\nwould decrease. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, the Company increased its look-back period to\n51 quarters to continue to include losses\nincurred by the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2009. The Company\nwill likely continue to increase its look-\nback period to incorporate the effects of at least one economic downturn in\nits loss history. During 2020,\nthe Company\nadjusted certain qualitative and economic factors related to changes in economic conditions\ndriven by the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions, including\nhigher unemployment in our primary market\narea.\nDuring 2021, the Company adjusted certain qualitative and economic factors to reflect\nimprovements in economic\nconditions in our primary market area.\nFurther adjustments may be made in the future as a result of the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic.\nAssessment for Other-Than-Temporary\nImpairment of Securities\nOn a quarterly basis, management makes an assessment to determine\nwhether there have been events or economic\ncircumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is other-than-temporarily\nimpaired.\nFor debt securities with an unrealized loss, an other-than-temporary\nimpairment write-down is triggered when (1) the\nCompany has the intent to sell a debt security,\n(2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the\ndebt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) the Company does not expect\nto recover the entire amortized\ncost basis of the debt security.\nIf the Company has the intent to sell a debt security or if it is more likely than not that it\nwill\nbe required to sell the debt security before recovery,\nthe other-than-temporary write-down is equal to the entire difference\nbetween the debt security's amortized cost\nand its fair value.\nIf the Company does not intend to sell the security or it is not\nmore likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery,\nthe other-than-temporary impairment write-\ndown is separated into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due\nto all other factors.\nThe\ncredit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between\nthe security's amortized cost basis and\nthe\npresent value of its expected future cash flows.\nThe remaining difference between the security's\nfair value and the present\nvalue of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome, net of applicable taxes.\nThe Company is required to own certain stock as a condition of membership, such as\nFederal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d)\nand Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d).\nThese non-marketable equity securities are accounted for at cost\nwhich equals par or\nredemption value.\nThese securities do not have a readily determinable fair value as their ownership is restricted and\nthere is\nno market for these securities.\nThe Company records these non-marketable equity securities as a component\nof other\nassets, which are periodically evaluated for impairment. Management considers\nthese non-marketable equity securities to\nbe long-term investments. Accordingly,\nwhen evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers\nthe\nultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in\nvalue.\nFair Value\nDetermination\nU.S. GAAP requires management to value and disclose certain of the Company's\nassets and liabilities at fair value,\nincluding investments classified as available-for-sale and derivatives.\nASC 820,\nFair Value\nMeasurements and Disclosures\n,\nwhich defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP and expands\ndisclosures about fair value measurements.\nFor more information regarding fair value measurements and disclosures,\nplease refer to Note 14, Fair Value,\nof the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.\nFair values are based on active market prices of identical assets or liabilities when available.\nComparable assets or\nliabilities or a composite of comparable assets in active markets are used when identical assets\nor liabilities do not have\nreadily available active market pricing.\nHowever, some of the Company's\nassets or liabilities lack an available or\ncomparable trading market characterized by frequent transactions between\nwilling buyers and sellers. In these cases, fair\nvalue is estimated using pricing models that use discounted cash flows and\nother pricing techniques. Pricing models and\ntheir underlying assumptions are based upon management's\nbest estimates for appropriate discount rates, default rates,\nprepayments, market volatility and other factors, taking into account current observable\nmarket data and experience.\nThese assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported\nfair values of assets and liabilities and the related income\nand expense. As such, the use of different models and assumptions, as\nwell as changes in market conditions, could result in\nmaterially different net earnings and retained earnings results.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned ( OREO\u201d), consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or\nin satisfaction of loans and is\nreported at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell at the date acquired with any loss\nrecognized as a\ncharge-off through the allowance for loan losses. Additional\nOREO losses for subsequent valuation adjustments are\ndetermined on a specific property basis and are included as a component of other noninterest\nexpense along with holding\ncosts. Any gains or losses on disposal of OREO are also reflected in noninterest expense.\nSignificant judgments and\ncomplex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of OREO, and the period of time\nwithin which such estimates\ncan be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of\nmarket volatility. As a result, the net proceeds\nrealized from sales transactions could differ significantly from\nappraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to\ndetermine the fair value of OREO.\nDeferred Tax\nAsset Valuation\nA valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of available\nevidence, it is more-likely-\nthan-not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The\nultimate realization of deferred tax assets\nis dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods\nin which those temporary differences become\ndeductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred\ntax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax\nplanning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of taxable income over\nthe last three years and\nprojections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are\ndeductible, management believes\nit is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences\nat December 31, 2021.

The Company's\nnet interest margin could experience pressure due to reduced earning asset\nyields and\nincreased competition for quality loan opportunities.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to provide\nan allowance for loan losses that\nmanagement believes, based on its processes and estimates, should be adequate\nto provide for the probable losses on\noutstanding loans. The Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.6\nmillion during 2021, compared to\n$1.1 million in provision for loan losses during 2020.\nThe negative provision for loan losses was primarily related to\nimprovements in economic conditions in our primary market area.\nThe provision for loan losses is based upon various\nfactors, including the absolute level of loans, loan growth, the credit quality,\nand the amount of net charge-offs or\nrecoveries.\nBased upon its assessment of the loan portfolio, management adjusts the allowance\nfor loan losses to an amount it believes\nshould be appropriate to adequately cover its estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio.\nThe Company's allowance\nfor loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.08% at December 31, 2021, compared\nto 1.22% at December 31, 2020.\nExcluding PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the SBA, the Company's\nallowance for loan losses was 1.10% and 1.27% of\ntotal loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWhile the policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance\nfor loan losses, as well as the resulting provision for loan losses charged to operations,\nare considered adequate by\nmanagement and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators, they are based on estimates\nand judgments and are\ntherefore approximate and imprecise. Factors beyond our control (such as conditions\nin the local and national economy,\nlocal real estate markets, or industries) may have a material adverse effect\non our asset quality and the adequacy of our\nallowance for loan losses resulting in significant increases in the provision\nfor loan losses.\nNoninterest Income\nYear ended December 31\n(Dollars in thousands)\nService charges on deposit accounts\n$\n$\nMortgage lending\n1,547\n2,319\nBank-owned life insurance\nSecurities gains, net\nOther\n1,757\n1,644\nTotal noninterest income\n$\n4,288\n$\n5,375\nThe decrease in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily driven by a decline\nin consumer spending activity as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company's income from mortgage lending\nis primarily attributable to the (1) origination and sale of new mortgage\nloans and (2) servicing of mortgage loans. Origination income, net, is comprised of gains\nor losses from the sale of the\nmortgage loans originated, origination fees, underwriting fees and other fees associated\nwith the origination of loans, which\nare netted against the commission expense associated with these originations. The\nCompany's normal practice is to\noriginate mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market and to either sell or\nretain the MSRs when the loan is sold.\nMSRs are recognized based on the fair value of the servicing right on the date the corresponding\nmortgage loan is sold.\nSubsequent to the date of transfer, the Company\nhas elected to measure its MSRs under the amortization method.\nServicing\nfee income is reported net of any related amortization expense.\nThe Company evaluates MSRs for impairment on a quarterly basis.\nImpairment is determined by grouping MSRs by\ncommon predominant characteristics, such as interest rate and loan type.\nIf the aggregate carrying amount of a particular\ngroup of MSRs exceeds the group's aggregate fair\nvalue, a valuation allowance for that group is established.\nThe valuation\nallowance is adjusted as the fair value changes.\nAn increase in mortgage interest rates typically results in an increase in the\nfair value of the MSRs while a decrease in mortgage interest rates typically results in a decrease\nin the fair value of MSRs.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the Company's\nmortgage lending income for 2021 and 2020.\nYear ended December 31\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOrigination income\n$\n1,417\n$\n2,300\nServicing fees, net\nTotal mortgage lending income\n$\n1,547\n$\n2,319\nThe Company's income from mortgage lending\ntypically fluctuates as mortgage interest rates change and is primarily\nattributable to the origination and sale of new mortgage loans. Origination income\ndecreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due\nto a decrease in refinance activity in our primary market.\nThe decrease in origination income was partially offset by an\nincrease in servicing fees, net of related amortization expense as prepayment\nspeeds slowed during 2021, resulting in\ndecreased amortization expense.\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance decreased primarily due to $0.3\nmillion in non-taxable death benefits received in\n2020. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers\nand the income we receive (i.e.,\nincreases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies and death benefits received)\non these policies is dependent\nupon the returns the insurance carriers are able to earn on the underlying investments that\nsupport these policies.

For more information regarding changes\nin accounting estimates, please refer to Note\n1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements\nthat accompany this report.\nThe increase in FDIC and other regulatory assessments was primarily due to the expiration\nof FDIC assessment credits\nduring 2020 and an increased assessment base during 2021.\nIncome Tax\nExpense\nIncome tax expense was $1.4 million in 2021 and $1.6 million in 2020.\nThe Company's effective income\ntax rate was\n14.89% in 2021, compared to 17.72% in 2020.\nThis change was primarily due to an income tax benefit related to a New\nMarkets Tax Credit investment\nfunded in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe Company's effective income\ntax rate is\nprincipally impacted by tax-exempt earnings from the Company's\ninvestments in municipal securities, bank-owned life\ninsurance, and New Markets Tax\nCredits.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nSecurities\nSecurities available-for-sale were $421.9\nmillion at December 31, 2021, compared to $335.2 million at December 31, 2020.\nThis increase reflects an increase in the amortized cost basis of securities available-for-sale\nof $95.7 million, and a decrease\nof $9.0 million in the fair value of securities available-for-sale.\nThe increase in the amortized cost basis of securities\navailable-for-sale was primarily attributable to management\nallocating more funding to the investment portfolio following\nthe significant increases in customer deposits. The decrease in the fair value of securities\nwas primarily due to an increase\nin long-term interest rates. The average annualized tax-equivalent\nyields earned on total securities were 1.66%\nin 2021 and\n2.11%\nin 2020.\nThe following table shows the carrying value and weighted average yield of securities available\n-for-sale as of December\n31, 2021 according to contractual maturity.\nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of mortgage-backed\nsecurities ( MBS\u201d) because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called\nor prepaid with or without penalty.\nDecember 31, 2021\n1 year\n1 to 5\n5 to 10\nAfter 10\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands)\nor less\nyears\nyears\nyears\nFair Value\nAgency obligations\n$\n5,007\n49,604\n69,802\n-\n124,413\nAgency MBS\n-\n35,855\n186,836\n223,371\nState and political subdivisions\n15,743\n57,547\n74,107\nTotal available-for-sale\n$\n5,177\n50,931\n121,400\n244,383\n421,891\nWeighted average yield (1):\nAgency obligations\n2.00%\n1.36%\n1.31%\n-\n1.36%\nAgency MBS\n-\n3.42%\n1.48%\n1.34%\n1.37%\nState and political subdivisions\n4.25%\n2.85%\n2.18%\n2.77%\n2.64%\nTotal available-for-sale\n2.07%\n1.40%\n1.47%\n1.68%\n1.59%\n(1) Yields are calculated based on amortized cost.\nLoans\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n83,977\n82,585\nConstruction and land development\n32,432\n33,514\nCommercial real estate\n258,371\n255,136\nResidential real estate\n77,661\n84,154\nConsumer installment\n6,682\n7,099\nTotal loans\n459,123\n462,488\nLess:\nunearned income\n(759)\n(788)\nLoans, net of unearned income\n$\n458,364\n461,700\nTotal loans, net of unearned income,\nwere $458.4 million at December 31, 2021, and $461.7 million at December\n31, 2020.\nExcluding PPP loans, total loans, net of unearned income, were $450.5\nmillion, an increase of $7.5 million, or 2% from\nDecember 31, 2020.\nThis increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial and industrial loans\n,\nnet of PPP,\nof\n$12.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in residential real estate loans of\n$6.5 million, as lower rates increased refinance\nactivity and payoffs for consumer mortgage loans.\nFour loan categories represented the majority of the loan portfolio at\nDecember 31, 2021: commercial real estate (56%), residential real estate (17%),\ncommercial and industrial (18%) and\nconstruction and land development (7%).\nApproximately 25% of the Company's commercial\nreal estate loans were\nclassified as owner-occupied at December 31, 2021.\nWithin the residential real estate portfolio\nsegment, the Company had junior lien mortgages of approximately $7.2 million,\nor 2%, and $8.7 million, or 2%, of total loans, net of unearned income at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor\nresidential real estate mortgage loans with a consumer purpose, the Company\nhad no loans that required interest only\npayments at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company's\nresidential real estate mortgage portfolio does not include any\noption ARM loans, subprime loans, or any material amount of other high-risk consumer\nmortgage products.\nThe average yield earned on loans and loans held for sale was 4.45% in 2021\nand 4.74% in 2020.\nThe specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio include,\nbut are not limited to, the effects of\ncurrent economic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic's\neffects, on our borrowers' cash flows, real estate market\nsales volumes, valuations, availability and cost of financing properties,\nreal estate industry concentrations, competitive\npressures from a wide range of other lenders, deterioration in certain credits, interest rate\nfluctuations, reduced collateral\nvalues or non-existent collateral, title defects, inaccurate appraisals, financial deterioration\nof borrowers, fraud, and any\nviolation of applicable laws and regulations.\nThe Company attempts to reduce these economic and credit risks through its loan-to-value\nguidelines for collateralized\nloans, investigating the creditworthiness of borrowers and monitoring borrowers' financial\nposition. Also, we have\nestablished and periodically review,\nlending policies and procedures. Banking regulations limit a bank's\ncredit exposure by\nprohibiting unsecured loan relationships that exceed 10% of its capital; or 20%\nof capital, if loans in excess of 10% of\ncapital are fully secured. Under these regulations, we are prohibited from having secured\nloan relationships in excess of\napproximately $21.0 million. Furthermore, we have an internal limit\nfor aggregate credit exposure (loans outstanding plus\nunfunded commitments) to a single borrower of $18.9\nmillion. Our loan policy requires that the Loan Committee of the\nBoard of Directors approve any loan relationships that exceed this internal limit.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bank had no\nrelationships exceeding these limits.\nWe periodically analyze\nour commercial loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit\nrisk exists in any one or\nmore industries. We\nuse classification systems broadly accepted by the financial services industry in\norder to categorize our\ncommercial borrowers. Loan concentrations to borrowers in the following classes\nexceeded 25% of the Bank's total risk-\nbased capital at December 31, 2021 (and related balances at December 31,\n2020).\nDecember 31\n(In thousands)\nLessors of 1-4 family residential properties\n$\n47,880\n$\n49,127\nHotel/motel\n43,856\n42,900\nMulti-family residential properties\n42,587\n40,203\nShopping centers\n29,574\n30,000\nIn light of disruptions in economic conditions caused by COVID-19, the financial regulators\nhave issued guidance\nencouraging banks to work constructively with borrowers affected\nby the virus in our community.\nThis guidance, including\nthe Interagency Statement on COVID-19 Loan Modifications and the Interagency Examiner\nGuidance for Assessing Safety\nand Soundness Considering the Effect of the COVID-19\nPandemic on Institutions, provides that the agencies will not\ncriticize financial institutions that mitigate credit risk through prudent actions\nconsistent with safe and sound practices.\nSpecifically, examiners\nwill not criticize institutions for working with borrowers as part of a risk\nmitigation strategy\nintended to improve existing loans, even if the restructured loans have or develop\nweaknesses that ultimately result in\nadverse credit classification.\nUpon demonstrating the need for payment relief, the bank will work with qualified borrowers\nthat were otherwise current before the pandemic to determine the most appropriate\ndeferral option.\nFor residential\nmortgage and consumer loans the borrower may elect to defer payments for up to three\nmonths.\nInterest continues to\naccrue and the amount due at maturity increases.\nCommercial real estate, commercial, and small business borrowers may\nelect to defer payments for up to three months or pay scheduled interest payments for a\nsix-month period.\nThe bank\nrecognizes that a combination of the payment relief options may be prudent dependent\non a borrower's business type.\nAs\nof December 31, 2021, we had one COVID-19 loan deferral totaling $0.1\nmillion, compared to $32.3 million, or 7% of total\nloans at December 31, 2020.\nThe tables below provide information concerning the composition of these COVID-19\nmodifications as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020.\nCOVID-19 Modifications\nModification Types\n(Dollars in thousands)\n# of Loans\nModified\nBalance\n% of Portfolio\nModified\nInterest Only\nPayment\nP&I\nPayments\nDeferred\nDecember 31, 2021:\nResidential real estate\n$\n-\n-\n%\nTotal\n$\n-\n%\n-\n%\n%\nDecember 31, 2020:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n-\n%\n%\n-\n%\nCommercial real estate\n31,399\n-\nResidential real estate\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n32,273\n%\n%\n%\nCOVID-19 Modifications within Commercial Real Estate\nSegment\n(Dollars in thousands)\n# of Loans\nModified\nBalance of\nLoans Modified\n% of Total\nLoan Class\nDecember 31, 2020:\nHotel/motel\n$\n26,427\n%\nMultifamily\n3,530\nRestaurants\n1,442\nThere were no COVID-19 modifications within the commercial real estate segment at December\n31, 2021.\nSection 4013 of the CARES Act provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law\nfrom classification as a TDR\npursuant to GAAP.\nIn addition, the Interagency Statement on COVID-19 Loan Modifications provides\ncircumstances in\nwhich a loan modification is not subject to classification as a TDR if such loan is not eligible\nfor modification under\nSection 4013.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes\nappropriate to adequately cover\nthe Company's estimate of probable\nlosses inherent in the loan portfolio.

Securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase totaled $3.4 million and $2.4 million at December 31,\nand 2020, respectively.\nThe average rates paid on short-term borrowings were 0.51% and 0.48%\nin 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company had no long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY\nThe Company's consolidated stockholders' equity was $103.7 million and $107.7\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and\n2020,\nrespectively.\nThe decrease from December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an other comprehensive\nloss due to the\nchange in unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale, net of tax, of $6.7\nmillion, cash dividends paid of $3.7\nmillion\nand stock repurchases of $1.6 million, representing 45,946 shares,\nwhich was partially offset by net earnings of $8.0\nmillion.\nOn January 1, 2015, the Company and Bank became subject to the rules of the Basel III regulatory\ncapital framework and\nrelated Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act changes. The rules included\nthe implementation of a\ncapital conservation buffer that is added to the minimum requirements\nfor capital adequacy purposes. The capital\nconservation buffer was subject to a three year phase-in period\nthat began on January 1, 2016 and was fully phased-in on\nJanuary 1, 2019 at 2.5%. A banking organization with a conservation buffer\nof less than the required amount will be subject\nto limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary\nbonus payments to executive\nofficers. At December 31, 2021, the Bank's\nratio was sufficient to meet the fully phased-in conservation\nbuffer.\nEffective March 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve and the other federal\nbanking regulators adopted an interim final rule that\namended the capital conservation buffer.\nThe interim final rule was adopted as a final rule on August 26, 2020. The\nnew\nrule revises the definition of eligible retained income\u201d for purposes of the maximum payout\nratio to allow banking\norganizations to more freely use their capital buffers to promote\nlending and other financial intermediation activities, by\nmaking the limitations on capital distributions more gradual. The\neligible retained income is now the greater of (i) net\nincome for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects\nnot reflected in net income; and (ii)\nthe average of all net income over the preceding four quarters. The interim\nfinal rule only affects the capital buffers, and\nbanking organizations were encouraged to make prudent capital\ndistribution decisions.\nThe Federal Reserve has treated us as a small bank holding company' under the Federal\nReserve's policy.\nAccordingly,\nour capital adequacy is evaluated at the Bank level, and not for the Company and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. The Bank's\ntier 1 leverage ratio was 9.35%, CET1 risk-based capital ratio was 16.23%, tier 1 risk-based\ncapital ratio was 16.23%, and\ntotal risk-based capital ratio was 17.06%\nat December 31, 2021. These ratios exceed the minimum regulatory capital\npercentages of 5.0% for tier 1 leverage ratio, 6.5% for CET1 risk-based capital ratio,\n8.0% for tier 1 risk-based capital ratio,\nand 10.0% for total risk-based capital ratio to be considered well capitalized.\u201d\nThe Bank's capital conservation buffer\nwas\n9.06%\nat December 31, 2021.\nMARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT\nManagement's objective is to manage assets and\nliabilities to provide a satisfactory,\nconsistent level of profitability within\nthe framework of established liquidity,\nloan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. The Bank's\nAsset Liability\nManagement Committee ( ALCO\u201d) is charged with the responsibility\nof monitoring these policies, which are designed to\nensure an acceptable asset/liability composition. Two\ncritical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate risk and liquidity\nrisk management.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to market risk arising from\nfluctuations in interest rates because\nassets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. For example,\nif liabilities reprice faster than assets, and\ninterest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially decline. In addition, assets\nand liabilities may reprice at the same\ntime but by different amounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates is rising,\nthe Company may increase\nrates paid on interest bearing demand deposit accounts and savings deposit\naccounts by an amount that is less than the\ngeneral increase in market interest rates. Also, short-term and long-term\nmarket interest rates may change by different\namounts. For example, a flattening yield curve may reduce the interest spread\nbetween new loan yields and funding costs.\nFurther, the remaining maturity of various assets and\nliabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For\nexample, if long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply,\nmortgage-backed securities in the securities portfolio may\nprepay earlier than anticipated, which could reduce earnings. Interest rates may also\nhave a direct or indirect effect on loan\ndemand, loan losses, mortgage origination volume, the fair value of MSRs and other\nitems affecting earnings.\nALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands\nfor various types of loans and\ndeposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and\noff-balance sheet items. Measurements\nused to help manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation and an economic\nvalue of equity model.\nEarnings simulation\n. Management believes that interest rate risk is best estimated by our earnings simulation\nmodeling.\nOn at least a quarterly basis, the following 12 month time period is simulated to determine a\nbaseline net interest income\nforecast and the sensitivity of this forecast to changes in interest rates. The baseline forecast\nassumes an unchanged or flat\ninterest rate environment. Forecasted levels of earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities,\nand off-balance sheet financial\ninstruments are combined with ALCO forecasts of market interest rates for\nthe next 12 months and other factors in order to\nproduce various earnings simulations and estimates.\nTo help limit interest rate risk,\nwe have guidelines for earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest\nincome from gradual changes in interest rates.\nFor changes up or down in rates from management's\nflat interest rate\nforecast over the next 12 months, policy limits for net interest income variances are as follows:\n+/- 20% for a gradual change of 400 basis points\n+/- 15% for a gradual change of 300 basis points\n+/- 10% for a gradual change of 200 basis points\n+/- 5% for a gradual change of 100 basis points\nThe following table reports the variance of net interest income over the next 12\nmonths assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates up or down when compared to the baseline net interest income\nforecast at December 31, 2021.\nChanges in Interest Rates\nNet Interest Income % Variance\n400 basis points\n7.92\n%\n300 basis points\n5.61\n200 basis points\n3.59\n100 basis points\n1.54\n(100) basis points\n(0.44)\n(200) basis points\nNM\n(300) basis points\nNM\n(400) basis points\nNM\nNM=not meaningful\nAt December 31, 2021, our earnings simulation model indicated that\nwe were in compliance with the policy guidelines\nnoted above.\nEconomic Value\nof Equity\nEconomic value of equity ( EVE\u201d) measures the extent that estimated econom\nic values of our assets, liabilities and off-\nbalance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are\nestimated by discounting expected\ncash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items,\nwhich establishes a base case EVE. In contrast with our\nearnings simulation model which evaluates interest rate risk over a 12\nmonth timeframe, EVE uses a terminal horizon\nwhich allows for the re-pricing of all assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items.\nFurther, EVE is measured using values\nas of a point in time and does not reflect any actions that ALCO might take in responding to\nor anticipating changes in\ninterest rates, or market and competitive conditions.\nTo help limit interest rate risk,\nwe have stated policy guidelines for an instantaneous basis point change in interest rates,\nsuch that our EVE should not decrease from our base case by more than the following:\n45% for an instantaneous change of +/- 400 basis points\n35% for an instantaneous change of +/- 300 basis points\n25% for an instantaneous change of +/- 200 basis points\n15% for an instantaneous change of +/- 100 basis points\nThe following table reports the variance of EVE assuming an immediate change in\ninterest rates up or down when\ncompared to the baseline EVE at December 31, 2021.\nChanges in Interest Rates\nEVE % Variance\n400 basis points\n(20.53)\n%\n300 basis points\n(14.14)\n200 basis points\n(8.35)\n100 basis points\n(3.23)\n(100) basis points\n0.91\n(200) basis points\nNM\n(300) basis points\nNM\n(400) basis points\nNM\nNM=not meaningful\nAt December 31, 2021, our EVE model indicated that we were in compliance\nwith the policy guidelines noted above.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest\nincome will be affected by\nchanges in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated\nwith interest-bearing liabilities\nmay not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition,\nthe magnitude and duration of changes in interest\nrates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain\nassets and liabilities may have\nsimilar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different\ndegrees to changes in market interest rates, and other\neconomic and market factors, including market perceptions.\nInterest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate\nin advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types of assets\nand liabilities may lag behind\nchanges in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate\nmortgage loans, have features (generally\nreferred to as interest rate caps and floors\u201d) which limit changes in interest rates.\nPrepayment and early withdrawal levels\nalso could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments.\nThe ability of many\nborrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates or\neconomic stress, which may\ndiffer across industries and economic sectors. ALCO reviews each of the\nabove interest rate sensitivity analyses along with\nseveral different interest rate scenarios in seeking satisfactory,\nconsistent levels of profitability within the framework of the\nCompany's established liquidity,\nloan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.\nThe Company may also use derivative financial instruments to improve the balance between\ninterest-sensitive assets and\ninterest-sensitive liabilities and as one tool to manage interest rate sensitivity\nwhile continuing to meet the credit and\ndeposit needs of our customers. From time to time, the Company may enter into\ninterest rate swaps ( swaps\u201d) to facilitate\ncustomer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives,\nbut are not designated as hedging\ninstruments. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no derivative\ncontracts to assist in managing interest rate\nsensitivity.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity is the Company's ability to convert\nassets into cash equivalents in order to meet daily cash flow requirements,\nprimarily for deposit withdrawals, loan demand and maturing obligations. Without\nproper management of its liquidity,\nthe\nCompany could experience higher costs of obtaining funds due to insufficient liquidity,\nwhile excessive liquidity can lead\nto a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative higher-yielding\ninvestment opportunities.\nLiquidity is managed at two levels. The first is the liquidity of the Company.\nThe second is the liquidity of the Bank. The\nmanagement of liquidity at both levels is essential, because the Company and the Bank are\nseparate and distinct legal\nentities with different funding needs and sources, and each are subject\nto regulatory guidelines and requirements. The\nCompany depends upon dividends from the Bank for liquidity to pay its operating expenses,\ndebt obligations and\ndividends. The Bank's payment of dividends depends\non its earnings, liquidity,\ncapital and the absence of any regulatory\nrestrictions.\nThe primary source of funding and liquidity for the Company has been dividends received\nfrom the Bank. If needed, the\nCompany could also issue common stock or other securities. Primary uses of funds by the\nCompany include dividends paid\nto stockholders and stock repurchases.\nPrimary sources of funding for the Bank include customer deposits, other borrowings,\nrepayment and maturity of securities,\nand sale and repayment of loans.\nThe Bank has access to federal funds lines from various banks and borrowings\nfrom the\nFederal Reserve discount window.\nIn addition to these sources, the Bank has participated in the FHLB's advance program\nto obtain funding for its growth. Advances include both fixed and variable terms and\nare taken out with varying maturities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Bank had a remaining available line of credit with the FHLB\ntotaling $319.6 million.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Bank also had $41.0 million of federal funds lines, with none outstanding.\nPrimary uses of funds\ninclude repayment of maturing obligations and growing the loan portfolio.\nThe following table presents additional information about our contractual obligations\nas of December 31, 2021, which by\ntheir terms had contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December\n31, 2021:\nPayments due by period\n1 year\n1 to 3\n3 to 5\nMore than\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTotal\nor less\nyears\nyears\n5 years\nContractual obligations:\nDeposit maturities (1)\n$\n994,243\n948,364\n37,905\n7,785\nOperating lease obligations\nTotal\n$\n994,853\n948,484\n38,144\n7,926\n(1) Deposits with no stated maturity (demand, NOW, money market, and savings deposits) are\npresented in the \"1 year or less\" column\nManagement believes that the Company and the Bank have adequate sources of liquidity to\nmeet all known contractual\nobligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower,\ndepositor, and creditor\nrequirements over the next 12 months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bank had outstanding standby letters of credit of $1.\nmillion and unfunded loan commitments\noutstanding of $71.0 million. Because these commitments generally\nhave fixed expiration dates and many will expire\nwithout being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future\ncash requirements. If needed to\nfund these outstanding commitments, the Bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds\nsold or securities available-for-sale,\nor on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial\ninstitutions.\nResidential mortgage lending and servicing activities\nWe primarily sell conforming\nresidential mortgage loans in the secondary market to Fannie Mae\nwhile retaining the\nservicing of these loans. The sale agreements for these residential mortgage loans with\nFannie Mae and other investors\ninclude various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics\nof the residential mortgage\nloans. Although the representations and warranties vary among investors, they typically\ncover ownership of the loan,\nvalidity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing\nthe loan,\ncompliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, compliance with applicable\nfederal, state, and local\nlaws, among other matters.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans,\nwhich we have originated and sold,\nbut retained the servicing rights was $252.7 million. Although these loans are\ngenerally sold on a non-recourse basis,\nexcept for breaches of customary seller representations and warranties,\nwe may have to repurchase residential mortgage\nloans in cases where we breach such representations or warranties or the other terms of\nthe sale, such as where we fail to\ndeliver required documents or the documents we deliver are defective. Investors also\nmay require the repurchase of a\nmortgage loan when an early payment default underwriting review reveals significant\nunderwriting deficiencies, even if the\nmortgage loan has subsequently been brought current. Repurchase demands are typically\nreviewed on an individual loan by\nloan basis to validate the claims made by the investor and to determine if a contractually\nrequired repurchase event has\noccurred. We\nseek to reduce and manage the risks of potential repurchases or other claims by mortgage loan investors\nthrough our underwriting, quality assurance and servicing practices, including\ngood communications with our residential\nmortgage investors.\nThe Company was not required to repurchase any loans during 2021 and 2020\nas a result of representation and warranty\nprovisions contained in the Company's sale agreements\nwith Fannie Mae, and had no pending repurchase or make-whole\nrequests at December 31, 2021.\nWe service all residential\nmortgage loans originated and sold by us to Fannie Mae. As servicer,\nour primary duties are to:\n(1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments\nof principal and interest; (3) maintain\nand administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to\nthe mortgage loans; (4) maintain any\nrequired escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments;\nand (5) foreclose on\ndefaulted mortgage loans or take other actions to mitigate the potential losses to investors\nconsistent with the agreements\ngoverning our rights and duties as servicer.\nThe agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a\nstandard of responsibility for actions taken by us in\nsuch capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by us\nwhen acting in compliance with the\nrespective servicing agreements. However, if\nwe commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer,\nwe may be subject\nto termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice. The\nstandards governing servicing and\nthe possible remedies for violations of such standards are determined by servicing\nguides issued by Fannie Mae as well as\nthe contract provisions established between Fannie Mae and the Bank.\nRemedies could include repurchase of an affected\nloan.\nAlthough to date repurchase requests related to representation and warranty provisions,\nand servicing activities have been\nlimited, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may increase in frequency\nif investors more aggressively\npursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans. As of December\n31, 2021, we believe that this exposure is\nnot material due to the historical level of repurchase requests and loss trends, the results of\nour quality control reviews, and\nthe fact that 99% of our residential mortgage loans serviced for Fannie Mae\nwere current as of such date. We\nmaintain\nongoing communications with our investors and will continue to evaluate this exposure\nby monitoring the level and number\nof repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in our investor portfolios.\nSection 4021 of the CARES Act allows borrowers under 1-to-4 family residential\nmortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae to\nrequest forbearance to the servicer after affirming that such borrower\nis experiencing financial hardships during the\nCOVID-19 emergency.\nExcept for vacant or abandoned properties, Fannie Mae servicers may not initiate\nforeclosures on\nsimilar procedures or related evictions or sales until December 31, 2020.\nThe forbearance period was extended, generally,\nto March 31, 2021.\nThe Bank sells mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and services these on an actual/actual\nbasis. As a result,\nthe Bank is not obligated to make any advances to Fannie Mae on principal and interest on\nsuch mortgage loans where the\nborrower is entitled to forbearance.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data\npresented herein have been prepared in\naccordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require\nthe measurement of financial position and\noperating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in\nthe relative purchasing power of money\nover time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities\nof a financial institution\nare monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a\nfinancial institution's performance\nthan the effects of general levels of inflation.\nCURRENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nThe following ASU has been issued by the FASB\nbut is not yet effective.\n\u25cf\nASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic\n326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments;\nInformation about this pronouncement is described in more detail below.\nASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic\n326): - Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial\nInstruments\n, amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and\navailable for sale debt\nsecurities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, the new standard eliminates the probable\ninitial recognition threshold in\ncurrent GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected\ncredit losses using a broader\nrange of information regarding past events, current conditions and forecasts assessing the\ncollectability of cash flows. The\nallowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized\ncost basis of the financial assets to\npresent the net amount expected to be collected. For available for sale debt securities, credit\nlosses should be measured in a\nmanner similar to current GAAP,\nhowever the new standard will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance\nrather than as a write-down. The new guidance affects entities holding\nfinancial assets and net investment in leases that are\nnot accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect\nloans, debt securities, trade receivables, net\ninvestments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables,\nand any other financial assets not\nexcluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. For public\nbusiness entities, the new guidance was\noriginally effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2019. The Company has\ndeveloped an implementation team that is following a general timeline. The\nteam has been working with an advisory\nconsultant, with whom a third-party software license has been purchased.\nThe Company's preliminary evaluation\nindicates\nthe provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 are expected to impact the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements, in particular\nthe level of the reserve for credit losses. The Company is continuing to evaluate the\nextent of the potential impact and\nexpects that portfolio composition and economic conditions at the time of adoption\nwill be a factor. On October 16, 2019,\nthe FASB approved\na previously issued proposal granting smaller reporting companies a postponement of the required\nimplementation date for ASU 2016-13. The Company will now be required\nto implement the new standard in January 2023,\nwith early adoption permitted in any period prior to that date.\nTable 1\n- Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP,\nthis annual report on Form 10-K includes certain designated net\ninterest income amounts presented on a tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure, including the presentation of\ntotal revenue and the calculation of the efficiency ratio.\nThe Company believes the presentation of net interest income on a tax-equivalent\nbasis provides comparability of net\ninterest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and facilitates comparability\nwithin the industry. Although the\nCompany believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors'\nunderstanding of its business and performance,\nthese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to\nGAAP.\nThe reconciliation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures from GAAP to non-GAAP is presented below.\nYear ended December 31\n(In thousands)\nNet interest income (GAAP)\n$\n23,990\n24,338\n26,064\n25,570\n24,526\nTax-equivalent adjustment\n1,205\nNet interest income (Tax-equivalent)\n$\n24,460\n24,830\n26,621\n26,183\n25,731\nTable 2\n- Selected Financial Data\nYear ended December 31\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nIncome statement\nTax-equivalent interest income (a)\n$\n26,977\n28,686\n30,804\n29,859\n29,325\nTotal interest expense\n2,517\n3,856\n4,183\n3,676\n3,594\nTax equivalent net interest income (a)\n24,460\n24,830\n26,621\n26,183\n25,731\nProvision for loan losses\n(600)\n1,100\n(250)\n-\n(300)\nTotal noninterest income\n4,288\n5,375\n5,494\n3,325\n3,441\nTotal noninterest expense\n19,433\n19,554\n19,697\n17,874\n16,784\nNet earnings before income taxes and\ntax-equivalent adjustment\n9,915\n9,551\n12,668\n11,634\n12,688\nTax-equivalent adjustment\n1,205\nIncome tax expense\n1,406\n1,605\n2,370\n2,187\n3,637\nNet earnings\n$\n8,039\n7,454\n9,741\n8,834\n7,846\nPer share data:\nBasic and"}
