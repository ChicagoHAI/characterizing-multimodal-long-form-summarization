The sale of the cemetery and Stinar operations did provide sufficient cash during fiscal year 2014 to support day-to-day operations, amended debt service, and capital expenditures. During fiscal 2013, the Company amended and refinanced a majority of its debt. Subsequent to these amendments and refinancing, Stinar, as of June 30, 2014, has three notes payable aggregating $1,725,041 which mature from February 2016 through March 2033. Stinar also has an $886,507 term loan to finance inventories that matures in May 2018 and a $1,000,000 interest only line of credit to finance non-foreign accounts receivable, maturing in August 2015. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDuring 2008, 2010 and 2012, the Company issued convertible subordinated debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $555,000 to certain individuals who are officers or directors of the Company. During 2010, $20,000 of the debentures was satisfied. On July 1, 2010, $485,000 of the debentures initially due July 1, 2010, were amended, whereby the conversion rate of the debentures was revised from $0.90 to $0.50 per share (fair value of the Company's common stock at July 1, 2010 was $0.38 per share) and the maturity date was extended from July 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012. On November 12, 2010, an outside investor purchased a $30,000 debenture and in February 2011 another $75,000 debentures were purchased by an officer and a director of the Company. On July 1, 2012, all convertible debentures were amended, whereby the conversion rate of the debentures was revised from $0.50 to $0.40 per share (fair value of the Company's common stock at July 1, 2012 was $.40 per share) and the maturity date was extended from July 1, 2012 to July 1, 2014. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn connection with the sale of the cemetery operations, the purchase price of $2,060,000 consists of (1) $1,500,000 in cash and (2) satisfaction of $560,000 in indebtedness owned by the Company to Mr. Harvey in the form of (i) $410,000 principal amount of debentures and (ii) a short-term loan of $150,000. The remaining $230,000 of the debentures outstanding at June 30, 2013 was paid with the proceeds from the sale of the cemeteries. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tStinar operations expect to hire five to ten full-time or part-time employees during fiscal year 2015. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tStinar's capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200,000 under the five-year plan. The funds are planned to be used for improvements of the manufacturing plant roof, equipment and parking lot. These expenditures are expected to take place evenly over the five-year plan. Stinar's capital expenditures for 2014 were approximately $28,000, $15,000 for various hand tools and equipment $8,000 for building improvements which consist of overhead doors, and air exchange improvements, and $2,000 for a new copier for the front office, and $3,000 for software and hardware equipment. The Company expects to spend approximately $80,000, in fiscal year 2015 for Stinar's capital expenditures. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSTINAR OPERATIONS \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn 2014, revenue decreased $4,138,001, or 44%, from $9,415,838 in 2013 to $5,277,837. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in U.S. Government sales of $6,244,670.. The decrease in government sales related to no United States government or GSA contracts and very few options being exercised on contracts with the United States Air Force, which was caused by budget cut backs. International and United States commercial sales remain constant at fiscal years 2014 and 2013. In 2014, the number of separate sales of equipment was 105, or a decrease of 41 sales or 39% in comparison to fiscal year 2013. The greatest decrease was in hilift and stairs department, where sales decreased 50% and 29.6% respectively. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost of sales in 2014 was $4,413,257 or 83.7% of sales, compared to 98.6% in 2013. Accordingly, gross profit percentage increased to 16.3% in 2014, compared to 1.4% in 2013. Gross profit increased because of manufacturing more carts and less hilift and stairs which require a chassis and increased the costs of the equipment being sold. In 2014, a new contract for substantially the same types of products was entered into with the U.S. Government with improved pricing , which significantly improved Stinar's gross margins. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSelling expenses increased $5,015, or 3.5%, from $141,287 in 2013 to $146,302. The increase was primarily due to greater commissions paid to international agents. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $129,797, or 40.3%, from $320,328 in 2013 to $190,531. The decrease was primarily attributable to one less full time office employee, reduction of fines and penalties from government contracts, and decrease in amortization costs. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest expense on Stinar specific debt decreased $114,210, or 38.5%, from $296,472 in 2013 to $182,262. The decrease was attributable to less equipment build on a chassis and decreased in bank debt. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORPORATE: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRobert C Harvey forgave accrued salary of $440,000 and received no payments during the fiscal year 2014 for salary from either Oakridge Holdings, Inc. or Stinar. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral and administrative expenses were $364,283, an increase of $51,879, or 16.6% compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to increase in professional fees for accounting and attorneys of $32,600, and insurance of $19,689. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest Expense was $46,105 or a decrease of $39,502, or 46% from $85,607 in 2013 to $46,105. The decrease was due to the satisfaction of the debentures and short-term debt. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2013 \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCOMPARED TO 20 \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSTINAR OPERATIONS \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn 2013, revenue decreased $458,038, or 4.6%, from $9,872,259 in 2012 to $9,414,221. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in government and commercial sales in the United States of $502,758 and $1,886,691, respectively, which were partially offset by an increase in international sales of $1,949,220. The decrease in government sales related to no United States government GSA contracts and no options being exercised on contracts with the United States Air Force, which were caused by the budget cut backs. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost of sales in 2013 was $9,278,326, or 98.6% of sales, compared to 99.6% in 2012. Accordingly, gross profit percentage increased to 1.4% in 2013 compared to 0.4% in 2012. Gross profit has been lower the past few years due to a U.S. Government contract that was over-engineered. This contract expired the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSelling expenses increased $3,915, or 2.9%, from $137,372 in 2012 to $141,287. The increase was primarily due to increased commissions paid to international agents. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral and administrative expenses increased $47,277, or 17.4%, from $272,051 in 2012 to $320,328. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in office salaries of $15,091 and fines and penalties of $23,132, related to a change in a U.S. Government contract. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest expense on Stinar specific debt decreased $116,308, or 28%, from $412,780 in 2012 to $296,472. The decrease was attributable to less equipment being built on a chassis and a decrease in bank debt. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORPORATE: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOperating expenses increased $18,372, or 6.2%, from $294,032 in 2012 to $312,404. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in accounting expense of $7,144 and office rental expense $11,400. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest expense increased $1,007, or 1%, from $84,600 in 2012 to $85,607. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn July 2012, the Company amended its convertible debentures. The amendment extended the maturity date of the debentures from July 2013 to July 2014 and reduced the conversion rate from $0.50 to $0.40 per common share. As a result of the amendment, the existing debentures were considered extinguished and a loss on extinguishment of $224,000, equal to the excess fair value of the new debt over the carrying value of the existing debt, was charged to earnings. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNone. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 8: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 located at Exhibit 13,, are incorporated herein. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 9: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNone. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAn evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses that existed as of June 30, 2014, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). We continue to evaluate the potential steps to remediate such material weaknesses, as described below. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a and 15d - 15f under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tInternal Control - Integrated Framework \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t(1992) \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t. Based on management's assessment and those criteria, management believes that, as of June 30, 2014, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaterial Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with its assessment, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses at June 30, 2014: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDue to the limited number of Company personnel, a lack of segregation of duties exists. An essential part of internal control is for certain procedures to be properly segregated and the results of their performance be adequately reviewed. This is normally accomplished by assigning duties so that no one person handles a transaction from beginning to end and incompatible duties between functions are not handled by the same person. Our management plans to explore implementing cost-effective measures to establish a more formal review process in an effort to reduce the risk of fraud and financial misstatements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDue to weaknesses in the Company's financial reporting controls specifically relating to inventory at the Aviation Ground Support Equipment segment, management believes there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected, as happened with our 2009 - 2012 annual financial statements. Management plans to explore implementing cost effective measures to improve its inventory reporting system in an effort to reduce the risk of a material misstatement of the financial statements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDue to the lack of expertise and personnel for financial reporting, the Company was not able to file required financial reports on time. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Company did not have effective controls to provide reasonable assurance as to the proper recognition and recording of receivables and revenue. Management plans to consult with third party advisors who are knowledgeable regarding revenue recognition in an effort to reduce the risk and material misstatement of the financial statements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Our management's report of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls and procedures was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDuring the year ended June 30, 2014, we implemented our remediation efforts related to the following material weaknesses reported in the Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDue to the limited number of Company personnel, a lack of segregation of duties exists. An essential part of internal control is for certain procedures to be properly segregated and the results of their performance to be adequately reviewed. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDue to weaknesses in the Company's financial reporting controls specifically relating to inventory, management believes there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected, as happened with our 2009 - 2012 annual financial statements. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Company did not have effective controls to provide reasonable assurance as to the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles around complex and/or non-routine transactions, including accounting for modifications to its subordinated convertible debentures. The Company lacked adequate technical expertise to apply proper accounting methods within the provisions of FASB ASC 470-50, \"Modifications and Extinguishments\", to account for modifications made to the debentures in 2011 and 2013. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDue to the lack of expertise and personnel for financial reporting, the Company was not able to file required financial reports on time. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAs a result of the remediation efforts noted below, there were improvements in internal control over financial reporting during the Year ended June 30, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. There were no other changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemediation Actions \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn response to these material weaknesses, we developed remediation plans to address the control deficiencies identified in fiscal year 2013. We implemented the following remediation actions during the year ended June 30, 2014: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSegregation of duties \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEngaged a third party specialist for advice and consultation \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided training and education to different accounting functions \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEstablished review controls \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Financial reporting control \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided training for calculating the cost of raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCompleted review of the Company's critical accounting and internal control policies with third party advisors that are knowledgeable regarding GAAP and internal controls \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided training and education relating to accounting for debt modifications and extinguishments \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHired third party advisors to assist in preparing consolidated financial statements \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn addition to the above steps, management intends to continue its remediation efforts by: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvide ongoing training and education relating to GAAP around complex and non-routine transactions specifically identified through regular review of emerging issues and Company business activities. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCompleting our review with the assistance of a third party advisor of the Company's financial reporting controls and implementing recommended control procedures to strengthen the Company's control procedures in areas which involve significant judgements and estimates, which involve application of complex accounting methods under GAAP, or which could have a material impact on the accuracy of our financial statements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWe are committed to a strong internal control environment, and believe that, when fully implemented, the remediation actions described above will represent significant improvements in the Company's accounting and financial reporting functions. The Company has hired a full-time controller and had made tremendous progress with improving the training and education of staff and added the additional internal control processes designed to remediate these material weaknesses during the balance of 2015. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our remediation efforts in connection with management's future evaluations of internal control over financial reporting. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 9B: OTHER INFORMATION \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChanges in Registrant's Certifying Accountant \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOn February 4, 2014, Oakridge Holdings, Inc. (the \"Company\") dismissed BDO USA, LLP (\"BDO\") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Company appointed BDO to replace Moquist Thorvilson Kauffmann LLC (\"MTK\") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm on August 6, 2013, which appointment was reported on the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on August 8, 2013. BDO audited the Company's financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2013and MTK audited the Company's financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2012. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the Company's fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The decision to dismiss BDO was approved by the Company's Audit Committee. During the Company's fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 and the subsequent interim period preceding BDO's and MTK's dismissal, there were: (i)no \"disagreements\" (within the meaning of Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K)between the Company and its independent registered public accounting firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of BDO's and MTK's, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in its reports on the consolidated financial statements of the Company; and (ii)except as noted below, no \"reportable events\" (as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn connection with its audit of the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company's independent registered public accounting firms reported the existence of material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting to the audit committee of the Company. These material weaknesses and remediation were mentioned in detail in Part II, Item 9A of the 10-K filed on December 19, 2013. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOn February 27, 2014, with the approval of its Audit Committee, the Company appointed Olsen Thielen & Co., Ltd. as its independent registered public accounting firm. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPART III \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 10: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe following information has been furnished to the Company, as of January 29, 2016, by the persons who are directors of the Company.

The Company may also engage in transactions with individuals who are, or are family members of, directors or officers of the Company. The Company has an unwritten policy under which the Audit Committee reviews these transactions to examine whether the transactions are conducted on an arm's length basis. The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to the Board whether to approve the proposed transaction, which the Board has historically always followed. In all cases, these related-party transactions have been conducted on an arm's length basis, and none of the transactions require more specific disclosure under applicable SEC rules and regulations, except as described below.\nDuring fiscal years 2014 and 2013, amounts expensed for non-audit compliance services provided by entities related to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Robert Harvey, were $25,585 and $13,327, respectively. The Company also has a month-to-month operating lease for office space from the Chief Executive Officer and the total rent expense was $ 27,000 and $36,000 under this lease in fiscal years 2014 and 2013.\nOn June 16, 2009, the Company entered into unwritten loan agreements with our Chief Executive Officer and Robert Gregor, the Company's Secretary and Vice President of Sales and Marketing. The aggregate principal amount of each loan, which is the largest amount of principal outstanding since the date of the loan was as follows: (1) due to Robert Harvey, $150,000 and (2) due to Robert Gregor, $150,000. The loans were repaid during fiscal year 2014.. Each of the loans described in this paragraph bears interest at the rate of 9.00% per annum, is unsecured and is payable on demand. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, interest of $50,567 was paid to Robert Gregor and $7,147 was paid to Robert Harvey.\nOn May 10, 2008, the Company agreed to issue $505,000 aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Convertible Subordinated Debentures to the following people for cash contributed by those people to the Company: (1) Robert Harvey, the Company's Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and a director, and (2) Robert Gregor, the Company's Secretary, the Vice President of Sales and Marketing of one of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries and a director. The aggregate principal amount of each debenture, which is the largest amount of principal outstanding since July 1, 2012 was as follows: (1) for Robert Harvey, $410,000 and (2) for Robert Gregor, $150,000. The loan was repaid during fiscal year 2014. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, interest of $18,450 was paid to Robert Harvey and $3,750 was paid to Robert Gregor. Each debenture accrued interest at the rate of 9.00% per annum, payable on January 1 of each year until the principal amount of the debenture has been paid in full or converted into the Company's Common Stock.\nThe principal amount of the debentures is convertible into the Company's Common Stock from the date of issuance until the principal amount is paid in full at a rate of one share of Common Stock for each $0.40 principal amount, subject to typical anti-dilution adjustments. The conversion price of the debentures is equal to the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock as determined by the Board as of the date of issuance.\nDirector Independence\nAll of the Company's directors, except for Robert Harvey and Robert Gregor, are \"independent\" as that term is defined in Rule 5605(a) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Marketplace Rules. That is the standard for independence the Company has chosen for purposes of the disclosure required in this report by SEC rules (even though the Company's Common Stock is not listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market).\nITEM 14:PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.\n\t\t\t\tAggregate fees for professional services rendered for the Company by Olsen Thielen & Co.

Harvey, certify that:\n1. I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?K of Oakridge Holdings, Inc.;\n2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;\n3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;\n4. I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?15(e) and 15d\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and I have:\na) designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;\nb) designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under my supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;\nc) evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and\nd) disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?15(f) and 15d\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?15(f)) that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and\n5. I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):\na) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and\nb) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.\nDated: January 29, 2016\nBy /s/ ROBERT C.

Oakridge Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary (the Company) operate an aviation ground support equipment business in Minnesota. On June 29, 1998, the Company acquired the net assets of an aviation ground support equipment business (Stinar). Stinar designs, engineers and manufactures aviation ground support equipment serving the United States Armed Services and businesses domestically and internationally. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn December 11, 2013, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Robert C. Harvey, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and a director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to Mr. Harvey the shares of common stock of Lain and Son, Inc. (\"Lain\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Lain and its subsidiaries own the assets used in the operations of the Company's cemetery business. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe purchase price payable to the Company under the Agreement was $2,060,000, consisting of (1) $1,500,000 in cash, and (2) satisfaction of $560,000 indebtedness owed by the Company to Mr. Harvey in the form of (i) $410,000 principal amount of debentures and (ii) a short-term loan of $150,000. The net carrying value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the cemetery operations was approximately negative $6,000 as of December 11, 2013. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe closing of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (the \"Transactions\") was completed on December 23, 2013. Following completion of the Transactions, Mr. Harvey has continued in his role as the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Company has no continuing involvement with Lain and Son, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The Company does not have the ability to influence operations or financial policies, has not retained risk associated with Lain and Son, Inc. and its subsidiaries' operations, and does not have the ability to restrict other entities from benefiting through association with Lain and Son, Inc. and its subsidiaries. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrinciples of Consolidation \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Oakridge Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary, which is wholly-owned. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements reflect Lain and Son, Inc. and its subsidiaries as discontinued operations in all periods presented (See Note 12). \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSegment Reporting \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Company operates and manages the business under one reportable segment - the aviation ground support equipment. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComprehensive Income (Loss) \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tComprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) and items defined as other comprehensive income (loss). Items defined as other comprehensive income (loss) include items such as foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on certain marketable securities. For the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, there were no adjustments to net income (loss) to arrive at comprehensive income (loss). \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFair Values of Financial Instruments \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments at June 30, 2014 and 2013, and the methods and assumptions used to estimate such fair values, were as follows: \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCash, accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and due to finance company \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t- Fair value approximates the carrying amount because of the short maturity of those financial instruments. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLong-term debt and other notes payable \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t- Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the interest rates that are currently available to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities as of June 30, 2014 and 2013. The fair value of long-term debt and other notes payable approximated their carrying values at June 30, 2014 and 2013. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEstimates and Assumptions \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOAKRIDGE HOLDINGS, INC.

As a result, actual amounts could differ from those estimates. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConcentrations \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit Risk \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Company's cash deposits from time to time exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its cash deposits in the past. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company generally does not require collateral for its trade accounts receivable. The United States (U.S.) Government accounted for 60% of Stinar's accounts receivable at June 30, 2014. One United States customer accounted for 16% or $261,827 and one international customer accounted for 68% or $1,100,965 of Stinar's accounts receivable at June 30, 2013. Additionally, the U.S. Government accounted for approximately 61% and 0% of Stinar's accounts receivable at June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCustomers \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA significant portion of the Company's customers are concentrated in the aviation industry. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStinar's net sales were concentrated as follows in 2014; international customers (27%), U.S. Government (42%) and North American are (31%). Stinar's net sales were concentrated as follows in 2013: international customers (24%) of which one customer comprised 23%, U.S. Government (63%) and North American (13%) \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCash and Cash Equivalents \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows and balance sheets, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At June 30, 2014 and 2013, there were no cash equivalents. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRestricted Cash \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRestricted cash represents amounts required to be held in escrow by certain customers until completion of certain projects. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccounts Receivable \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccounts receivable are customer obligations generally due under normal trade terms for the industries served by the Company. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company's estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of accounts receivable. When management determines that it is probable that an account will not be collected, all or a portion of the amount is charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInventories \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinished goods, component parts and work-in-process inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out [FIFO]) or market. The Company reviews inventory on an annual basis and provides an inventory reserve for slow-moving, obsolete or unusable inventory, if necessary. As of June 30, 2014 and 2013, the Company has determined an inventory reserve to be unnecessary. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProperty and Equipment \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProperty and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets and are generally depreciated over a 3 to 15 year period. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as incurred and significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDebt Issuance Costs \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDebt issuance costs are carried at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the related debt. Amortization of these debt costs, recognized and reported as interest expense for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, was $14,598 and $8,757, respectively. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOAKRIDGE HOLDINGS, INC.

The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProduct Warranty Liability \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Company's aviation ground equipment segment warrants its products against certain defects based on contract terms. Generally, warranty periods are five years for workmanship and manufacturing defects and seven years for painting defects. The Company has recourse provisions for certain items that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid under the warranties. At June 30, 2014 and 2013, the Company's estimated product warranty liability based on historical activity was $15,000 and $0, respectively. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRevenue Recognition \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn May 2014, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures (GAAP). The core principles of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principles and, in doing so more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption ( which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2017. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAviation Ground Support Equipment \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRevenue is recognized when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShipping and Handling Costs \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll shipping and handling revenue is included in revenue. All direct costs to ship the products to customers are classified as cost of goods sold. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIncome Taxes \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIncome taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred income taxes. The significant temporary differences relate to research and development credit carry forwards, operating loss carry forwards, depreciation, inventories and certain accruals. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at the time, based upon available evidence, it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Management also assesses whether uncertain tax positions, as filed, could result in the recognition of a liability for possible interest and penalties. The Company's policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company has not identified any material uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2014 and 2013. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOAKRIDGE HOLDINGS, INC.

Expenditures that result from the remediation of an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenue are expensed. Liabilities are recognized for remedial activities when the clean-up is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has not identified any environmental cost liabilities as of June 30, 2014 and 2013. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdvertising Costs \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tResearch and Development Costs \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tResearch and development costs in the product development process are expensed as incurred.

Diluted net earnings (loss) per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, consisting of shares that might be issued upon the conversion of subordinated debentures and adjusting the net earnings (loss) applicable to common stockholders resulting from the assumed conversions. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent Accounting Pronouncements \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(a) Revenue Recognition \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-14, \"Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which extended the effective date of a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The new standard will now be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(b) Going Concern \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 \"Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) (Topic 718): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\". This ASU requires an entity to evaluate whether conditions or events, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(C) Inventory Measurement \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, \"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\" (\"ASU 2015-11\"). An entity using an inventory method other than last-in, first out (\"LIFO\") or the retail inventory method should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The new guidance clarifies that net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(D) Disclosure of Discontinued Operations \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08 \"Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity\". The amendments in this Update improve the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tOAKRIDGE HOLDINGS, INC.

Under the Plan, individuals are eligible based on the judgment of a committee of Board members (committee). At the discretion of the committee, eligible recipients may be granted options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price per share equal to the market price at the grant date. The stock options are exercisable at such times and in such installments as determined by the committee, limited to a maximum of ten years from the date of the grant. The Plan has authorized the issuance of 175,000 shares of common stock under the Plan, there were no grants for shares issued in 2014 and 2013, and as of June 30, 2014, 175,000 shares were available for future grants.

relies on cash flow from its aviation manufacturing company to meet operating needs, fund debt service, and fund capital requirements. The sale of the cemetery and Stinar operations did provide sufficient cash during fiscal year 2014 to support day-to-day operations, amended debt service, and capital expenditures. During fiscal 2013, the Company amended and refinanced a majority of its debt. Subsequent to these amendments and refinancing, Stinar, as of June 30, 2014, has three notes payable aggregating $1,725,041 which mature from February 2016 through March 2033. Stinar also has an $886,507 term loan to finance inventories that matures in May 2018 and a $1,000,000 interest only line of credit to finance non-foreign accounts receivable, maturing in August 2015. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDuring 2008, 2010 and 2012, the Company issued convertible subordinated debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $555,000 to certain individuals who are officers or directors of the Company. During 2010, $20,000 of the debentures was satisfied. On July 1, 2010, $485,000 of the debentures initially due July 1, 2010, were amended, whereby the conversion rate of the debentures was revised from $0.90 to $0.50 per share (fair value of the Company's common stock at July 1, 2010 was $0.38 per share) and the maturity date was extended from July 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012. On November 12, 2010, an outside investor purchased a $30,000 debenture and in February 2011 another $75,000 debentures were purchased by an officer and a director of the Company. On July 1, 2012, all convertible debentures were amended, whereby the conversion rate of the debentures was revised from $0.50 to $0.40 per share (fair value of the Company's common stock at July 1, 2012 was $.40 per share) and the maturity date was extended from July 1, 2012 to July 1, 2014. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn connection with the sale of the cemetery operations, the purchase price of $2,060,000 consists of (1) $1,500,000 in cash and (2) satisfaction of $560,000 in indebtedness owned by the Company to Mr. Harvey in the form of (i) $410,000 principal amount of debentures and (ii) a short-term loan of $150,000. The remaining $230,000 of the debentures outstanding at June 30, 2013 was paid with the proceeds from the sale of the cemeteries. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tStinar operations expect to hire five to ten full-time or part-time employees during fiscal year 2015. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tStinar's capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200,000 under the five-year plan. The funds are planned to be used for improvements of the manufacturing plant roof, equipment and parking lot. These expenditures are expected to take place evenly over the five-year plan. Stinar's capital expenditures for 2014 were approximately $28,000, $15,000 for various hand tools and equipment $8,000 for building improvements which consist of overhead doors, and air exchange improvements, and $2,000 for a new copier for the front office, and $3,000 for software and hardware equipment. The Company expects to spend approximately $80,000, in fiscal year 2015 for Stinar's capital expenditures. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSTINAR OPERATIONS \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn 2014, revenue decreased $4,138,001, or 44%, from $9,415,838 in 2013 to $5,277,837. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in U.S. Government sales of $6,244,670.. The decrease in government sales related to no United States government or GSA contracts and very few options being exercised on contracts with the United States Air Force, which was caused by budget cut backs. International and United States commercial sales remain constant at fiscal years 2014 and 2013. In 2014, the number of separate sales of equipment was 105, or a decrease of 41 sales or 39% in comparison to fiscal year 2013. The greatest decrease was in hilift and stairs department, where sales decreased 50% and 29.6% respectively. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost of sales in 2014 was $4,413,257 or 83.7% of sales, compared to 98.6% in 2013. Accordingly, gross profit percentage increased to 16.3% in 2014, compared to 1.4% in 2013. Gross profit increased because of manufacturing more carts and less hilift and stairs which require a chassis and increased the costs of the equipment being sold. In 2014, a new contract for substantially the same types of products was entered into with the U.S. Government with improved pricing , which significantly improved Stinar's gross margins. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSelling expenses increased $5,015, or 3.5%, from $141,287 in 2013 to $146,302. The increase was primarily due to greater commissions paid to international agents. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $129,797, or 40.3%, from $320,328 in 2013 to $190,531. The decrease was primarily attributable to one less full time office employee, reduction of fines and penalties from government contracts, and decrease in amortization costs. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest expense on Stinar specific debt decreased $114,210, or 38.5%, from $296,472 in 2013 to $182,262. The decrease was attributable to less equipment build on a chassis and decreased in bank debt. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORPORATE: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRobert C Harvey forgave accrued salary of $440,000 and received no payments during the fiscal year 2014 for salary from either Oakridge Holdings, Inc. or Stinar. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral and administrative expenses were $364,283, an increase of $51,879, or 16.6% compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to increase in professional fees for accounting and attorneys of $32,600, and insurance of $19,689. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest Expense was $46,105 or a decrease of $39,502, or 46% from $85,607 in 2013 to $46,105. The decrease was due to the satisfaction of the debentures and short-term debt. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2013 \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCOMPARED TO 20 \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSTINAR OPERATIONS \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn 2013, revenue decreased $458,038, or 4.6%, from $9,872,259 in 2012 to $9,414,221. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in government and commercial sales in the United States of $502,758 and $1,886,691, respectively, which were partially offset by an increase in international sales of $1,949,220. The decrease in government sales related to no United States government GSA contracts and no options being exercised on contracts with the United States Air Force, which were caused by the budget cut backs. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost of sales in 2013 was $9,278,326, or 98.6% of sales, compared to 99.6% in 2012. Accordingly, gross profit percentage increased to 1.4% in 2013 compared to 0.4% in 2012. Gross profit has been lower the past few years due to a U.S. Government contract that was over-engineered. This contract expired the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSelling expenses increased $3,915, or 2.9%, from $137,372 in 2012 to $141,287. The increase was primarily due to increased commissions paid to international agents. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral and administrative expenses increased $47,277, or 17.4%, from $272,051 in 2012 to $320,328. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in office salaries of $15,091 and fines and penalties of $23,132, related to a change in a U.S. Government contract. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest expense on Stinar specific debt decreased $116,308, or 28%, from $412,780 in 2012 to $296,472. The decrease was attributable to less equipment being built on a chassis and a decrease in bank debt. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORPORATE: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOperating expenses increased $18,372, or 6.2%, from $294,032 in 2012 to $312,404. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in accounting expense of $7,144 and office rental expense $11,400. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest expense increased $1,007, or 1%, from $84,600 in 2012 to $85,607. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn July 2012, the Company amended its convertible debentures. The amendment extended the maturity date of the debentures from July 2013 to July 2014 and reduced the conversion rate from $0.50 to $0.40 per common share. As a result of the amendment, the existing debentures were considered extinguished and a loss on extinguishment of $224,000, equal to the excess fair value of the new debt over the carrying value of the existing debt, was charged to earnings. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNone. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 8: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 located at Exhibit 13,, are incorporated herein. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 9: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNone. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAn evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses that existed as of June 30, 2014, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). We continue to evaluate the potential steps to remediate such material weaknesses, as described below. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a and 15d - 15f under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tInternal Control - Integrated Framework \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t(1992) \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t. Based on management's assessment and those criteria, management believes that, as of June 30, 2014, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaterial Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with its assessment, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses at June 30, 2014: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDue to the limited number of Company personnel, a lack of segregation of duties exists. An essential part of internal control is for certain procedures to be properly segregated and the results of their performance be adequately reviewed. This is normally accomplished by assigning duties so that no one person handles a transaction from beginning to end and incompatible duties between functions are not handled by the same person. Our management plans to explore implementing cost-effective measures to establish a more formal review process in an effort to reduce the risk of fraud and financial misstatements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDue to weaknesses in the Company's financial reporting controls specifically relating to inventory at the Aviation Ground Support Equipment segment, management believes there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected, as happened with our 2009 - 2012 annual financial statements. Management plans to explore implementing cost effective measures to improve its inventory reporting system in an effort to reduce the risk of a material misstatement of the financial statements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDue to the lack of expertise and personnel for financial reporting, the Company was not able to file required financial reports on time. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Company did not have effective controls to provide reasonable assurance as to the proper recognition and recording of receivables and revenue. Management plans to consult with third party advisors who are knowledgeable regarding revenue recognition in an effort to reduce the risk and material misstatement of the financial statements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Our management's report of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls and procedures was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDuring the year ended June 30, 2014, we implemented our remediation efforts related to the following material weaknesses reported in the Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDue to the limited number of Company personnel, a lack of segregation of duties exists. An essential part of internal control is for certain procedures to be properly segregated and the results of their performance to be adequately reviewed. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDue to weaknesses in the Company's financial reporting controls specifically relating to inventory, management believes there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected, as happened with our 2009 - 2012 annual financial statements. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Company did not have effective controls to provide reasonable assurance as to the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles around complex and/or non-routine transactions, including accounting for modifications to its subordinated convertible debentures. The Company lacked adequate technical expertise to apply proper accounting methods within the provisions of FASB ASC 470-50, \"Modifications and Extinguishments\", to account for modifications made to the debentures in 2011 and 2013. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDue to the lack of expertise and personnel for financial reporting, the Company was not able to file required financial reports on time. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAs a result of the remediation efforts noted below, there were improvements in internal control over financial reporting during the Year ended June 30, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. There were no other changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemediation Actions \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn response to these material weaknesses, we developed remediation plans to address the control deficiencies identified in fiscal year 2013. We implemented the following remediation actions during the year ended June 30, 2014: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSegregation of duties \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEngaged a third party specialist for advice and consultation \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided training and education to different accounting functions \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEstablished review controls \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Financial reporting control \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided training for calculating the cost of raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCompleted review of the Company's critical accounting and internal control policies with third party advisors that are knowledgeable regarding GAAP and internal controls \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided training and education relating to accounting for debt modifications and extinguishments \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHired third party advisors to assist in preparing consolidated financial statements \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn addition to the above steps, management intends to continue its remediation efforts by: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvide ongoing training and education relating to GAAP around complex and non-routine transactions specifically identified through regular review of emerging issues and Company business activities. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCompleting our review with the assistance of a third party advisor of the Company's financial reporting controls and implementing recommended control procedures to strengthen the Company's control procedures in areas which involve significant judgements and estimates, which involve application of complex accounting methods under GAAP, or which could have a material impact on the accuracy of our financial statements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWe are committed to a strong internal control environment, and believe that, when fully implemented, the remediation actions described above will represent significant improvements in the Company's accounting and financial reporting functions. The Company has hired a full-time controller and had made tremendous progress with improving the training and education of staff and added the additional internal control processes designed to remediate these material weaknesses during the balance of 2015. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our remediation efforts in connection with management's future evaluations of internal control over financial reporting. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 9B: OTHER INFORMATION \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChanges in Registrant's Certifying Accountant \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOn February 4, 2014, Oakridge Holdings, Inc. (the \"Company\") dismissed BDO USA, LLP (\"BDO\") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Company appointed BDO to replace Moquist Thorvilson Kauffmann LLC (\"MTK\") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm on August 6, 2013, which appointment was reported on the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on August 8, 2013. BDO audited the Company's financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2013and MTK audited the Company's financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2012. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the Company's fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The decision to dismiss BDO was approved by the Company's Audit Committee. During the Company's fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 and the subsequent interim period preceding BDO's and MTK's dismissal, there were: (i)no \"disagreements\" (within the meaning of Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K)between the Company and its independent registered public accounting firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of BDO's and MTK's, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in its reports on the consolidated financial statements of the Company; and (ii)except as noted below, no \"reportable events\" (as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn connection with its audit of the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company's independent registered public accounting firms reported the existence of material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting to the audit committee of the Company. These material weaknesses and remediation were mentioned in detail in Part II, Item 9A of the 10-K filed on December 19, 2013. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOn February 27, 2014, with the approval of its Audit Committee, the Company appointed Olsen Thielen & Co., Ltd. as its independent registered public accounting firm. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPART III \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 10: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe following information has been furnished to the Company, as of January 29, 2016, by the persons who are directors of the Company.

Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are also required to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTo the Company's knowledge, based solely on its review of the forms furnished to the Company and written representations from certain reporting persons, the Company believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its executive officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock were complied with in fiscal year 2014. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCode of Ethics \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Company has not adopted a code of ethics that applies to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller and other employees performing similar functions.

The Audit Committee is also responsible for recommending to the Board the appointment of the Company's independent accountants. The Audit Committee met four times in fiscal year 2014. The Audit Committee currently consists of Lester Lind, Stewart Levin and Pamela Whitney. The Audit Committee has determined that Pamela Whitney is an \"audit committee financial expert\" and is \"independent\" as defined by SEC rules. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 11: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe following table sets forth certain information regarding compensation for the Company's two most recently completed fiscal years provided to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its only other executive officer who earned remuneration exceeding $100,000 during fiscal year 2014 (the \"Named Executive Officers\"). \t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tThe Company has not entered into employment agreements with any of the Named Executive Officers.

The Company may also engage in transactions with individuals who are, or are family members of, directors or officers of the Company. The Company has an unwritten policy under which the Audit Committee reviews these transactions to examine whether the transactions are conducted on an arm's length basis. The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to the Board whether to approve the proposed transaction, which the Board has historically always followed. In all cases, these related-party transactions have been conducted on an arm's length basis, and none of the transactions require more specific disclosure under applicable SEC rules and regulations, except as described below.\nDuring fiscal years 2014 and 2013, amounts expensed for non-audit compliance services provided by entities related to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Robert Harvey, were $25,585 and $13,327, respectively. The Company also has a month-to-month operating lease for office space from the Chief Executive Officer and the total rent expense was $ 27,000 and $36,000 under this lease in fiscal years 2014 and 2013.\nOn June 16, 2009, the Company entered into unwritten loan agreements with our Chief Executive Officer and Robert Gregor, the Company's Secretary and Vice President of Sales and Marketing. The aggregate principal amount of each loan, which is the largest amount of principal outstanding since the date of the loan was as follows: (1) due to Robert Harvey, $150,000 and (2) due to Robert Gregor, $150,000. The loans were repaid during fiscal year 2014.. Each of the loans described in this paragraph bears interest at the rate of 9.00% per annum, is unsecured and is payable on demand. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, interest of $50,567 was paid to Robert Gregor and $7,147 was paid to Robert Harvey.\nOn May 10, 2008, the Company agreed to issue $505,000 aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Convertible Subordinated Debentures to the following people for cash contributed by those people to the Company: (1) Robert Harvey, the Company's Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and a director, and (2) Robert Gregor, the Company's Secretary, the Vice President of Sales and Marketing of one of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries and a director. The aggregate principal amount of each debenture, which is the largest amount of principal outstanding since July 1, 2012 was as follows: (1) for Robert Harvey, $410,000 and (2) for Robert Gregor, $150,000. The loan was repaid during fiscal year 2014. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, interest of $18,450 was paid to Robert Harvey and $3,750 was paid to Robert Gregor. Each debenture accrued interest at the rate of 9.00% per annum, payable on January 1 of each year until the principal amount of the debenture has been paid in full or converted into the Company's Common Stock.\nThe principal amount of the debentures is convertible into the Company's Common Stock from the date of issuance until the principal amount is paid in full at a rate of one share of Common Stock for each $0.40 principal amount, subject to typical anti-dilution adjustments. The conversion price of the debentures is equal to the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock as determined by the Board as of the date of issuance.\nDirector Independence\nAll of the Company's directors, except for Robert Harvey and Robert Gregor, are \"independent\" as that term is defined in Rule 5605(a) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Marketplace Rules. That is the standard for independence the Company has chosen for purposes of the disclosure required in this report by SEC rules (even though the Company's Common Stock is not listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market).\nITEM 14:PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.\n\t\t\t\tAggregate fees for professional services rendered for the Company by Olsen Thielen & Co.

Oakridge Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary (the Company) operate an aviation ground support equipment business in Minnesota. On June 29, 1998, the Company acquired the net assets of an aviation ground support equipment business (Stinar). Stinar designs, engineers and manufactures aviation ground support equipment serving the United States Armed Services and businesses domestically and internationally. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn December 11, 2013, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Robert C. Harvey, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and a director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to Mr. Harvey the shares of common stock of Lain and Son, Inc. (\"Lain\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Lain and its subsidiaries own the assets used in the operations of the Company's cemetery business. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe purchase price payable to the Company under the Agreement was $2,060,000, consisting of (1) $1,500,000 in cash, and (2) satisfaction of $560,000 indebtedness owed by the Company to Mr. Harvey in the form of (i) $410,000 principal amount of debentures and (ii) a", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFISCAL 2014 \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Company relies on cash flow from its aviation manufacturing company to meet operating needs, fund debt service, and fund capital requirements. The sale of the cemetery and Stinar operations did provide sufficient cash during fiscal year 2014 to support day-to-day operations, amended debt service, and capital expenditures. During fiscal 2013, the Company amended and refinanced a majority of its debt. Subsequent to these amendments and refinancing, Stinar, as of June 30, 2014, has three notes payable aggregating $1,725,041 which mature from February 2016 through March 2033. Stinar also has an $886,507 term loan to finance inventories that matures in May 2018 and a $1,000,000 interest only line of credit to finance non-foreign accounts receivable, maturing in August 2015. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDuring 2008, 2010 and 2012, the Company issued convertible subordinated debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $555,000 to certain individuals who are officers or directors of the Company. During 2010, $20,000 of the debentures was satisfied. On July 1, 2010, $485,000 of the debentures initially due July 1, 2010, were amended, whereby the conversion rate of the debentures was revised from $0.90 to $0.50 per share (fair value of the Company's common stock at July 1, 2010 was $0.38 per share) and the maturity date was extended from July 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012. On November 12, 2010, an outside investor purchased a $30,000 debenture and in February 2011 another $75,000 debentures were purchased by an officer and a director of the Company. On July 1, 2012, all convertible debentures were amended, whereby the conversion rate of the debentures was revised from $0.50 to $0.40 per share (fair value of the Company's common stock at July 1, 2012 was $.40 per share) and the maturity date was extended from July 1, 2012 to July 1, 2014. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn connection with the sale of the cemetery operations, the purchase price of $2,060,000 consists of (1) $1,500,000 in cash and (2) satisfaction of $560,000 in indebtedness owned by the Company to Mr. Harvey in the form of (i) $410,000 principal amount of debentures and (ii) a short-term loan of $150,000. The remaining $230,000 of the debentures outstanding at June 30, 2013 was paid with the proceeds from the sale of the cemeteries. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tStinar operations expect to hire five to ten full-time or part-time employees during fiscal year 2015. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tStinar's capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200,000 under the five-year plan. The funds are planned to be used for improvements of the manufacturing plant roof, equipment and parking lot. These expenditures are expected to take place evenly over the five-year plan. Stinar's capital expenditures for 2014 were approximately $28,000, $15,000 for various hand tools and equipment $8,000 for building improvements which consist of overhead doors, and air exchange improvements, and $2,000 for a new copier for the front office, and $3,000 for software and hardware equipment. The Company expects to spend approximately $80,000, in fiscal year 2015 for Stinar's capital expenditures. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSTINAR OPERATIONS \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn 2014, revenue decreased $4,138,001, or 44%, from $9,415,838 in 2013 to $5,277,837. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in U.S. Government sales of $6,244,670.. The decrease in government sales related to no United States government or GSA contracts and very few options being exercised on contracts with the United States Air Force, which was caused by budget cut backs. International and United States commercial sales remain constant at fiscal years 2014 and 2013. In 2014, the number of separate sales of equipment was 105, or a decrease of 41 sales or 39% in comparison to fiscal year 2013. The greatest decrease was in hilift and stairs department, where sales decreased 50% and 29.6% respectively. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost of sales in 2014 was $4,413,257 or 83.7% of sales, compared to 98.6% in 2013. Accordingly, gross profit percentage increased to 16.3% in 2014, compared to 1.4% in 2013. Gross profit increased because of manufacturing more carts and less hilift and stairs which require a chassis and increased the costs of the equipment being sold. In 2014, a new contract for substantially the same types of products was entered into with the U.S. Government with improved pricing , which significantly improved Stinar's gross margins. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSelling expenses increased $5,015, or 3.5%, from $141,287 in 2013 to $146,302. The increase was primarily due to greater commissions paid to international agents. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $129,797, or 40.3%, from $320,328 in 2013 to $190,531. The decrease was primarily attributable to one less full time office employee, reduction of fines and penalties from government contracts, and decrease in amortization costs. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest expense on Stinar specific debt decreased $114,210, or 38.5%, from $296,472 in 2013 to $182,262. The decrease was attributable to less equipment build on a chassis and decreased in bank debt. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORPORATE: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRobert C Harvey forgave accrued salary of $440,000 and received no payments during the fiscal year 2014 for salary from either Oakridge Holdings, Inc. or Stinar. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral and administrative expenses were $364,283, an increase of $51,879, or 16.6% compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to increase in professional fees for accounting and attorneys of $32,600, and insurance of $19,689. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest Expense was $46,105 or a decrease of $39,502, or 46% from $85,607 in 2013 to $46,105. The decrease was due to the satisfaction of the debentures and short-term debt. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2013 \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCOMPARED TO 20 \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSTINAR OPERATIONS \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn 2013, revenue decreased $458,038, or 4.6%, from $9,872,259 in 2012 to $9,414,221. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in government and commercial sales in the United States of $502,758 and $1,886,691, respectively, which were partially offset by an increase in international sales of $1,949,220. The decrease in government sales related to no United States government GSA contracts and no options being exercised on contracts with the United States Air Force, which were caused by the budget cut backs. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost of sales in 2013 was $9,278,326, or 98.6% of sales, compared to 99.6% in 2012. Accordingly, gross profit percentage increased to 1.4% in 2013 compared to 0.4% in 2012. Gross profit has been lower the past few years due to a U.S. Government contract that was over-engineered. This contract expired the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSelling expenses increased $3,915, or 2.9%, from $137,372 in 2012 to $141,287. The increase was primarily due to increased commissions paid to international agents. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral and administrative expenses increased $47,277, or 17.4%, from $272,051 in 2012 to $320,328. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in office salaries of $15,091 and fines and penalties of $23,132, related to a change in a U.S. Government contract. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest expense on Stinar specific debt decreased $116,308, or 28%, from $412,780 in 2012 to $296,472. The decrease was attributable to less equipment being built on a chassis and a decrease in bank debt. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORPORATE: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOperating expenses increased $18,372, or 6.2%, from $294,032 in 2012 to $312,404. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in accounting expense of $7,144 and office rental expense $11,400. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest expense increased $1,007, or 1%, from $84,600 in 2012 to $85,607. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn July 2012, the Company amended its convertible debentures. The amendment extended the maturity date of the debentures from July 2013 to July 2014 and reduced the conversion rate from $0.50 to $0.40 per common share.

Notwithstanding the material weaknesses that existed as of June 30, 2014, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). We continue to evaluate the potential steps to remediate such material weaknesses, as described below. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a and 15d - 15f under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tInternal Control - Integrated Framework \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t(1992) \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t. Based on management's assessment and those criteria, management believes that, as of June 30, 2014, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaterial Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with its assessment, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses at June 30, 2014: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDue to the limited number of Company personnel, a lack of segregation of duties exists. An essential part of internal control is for certain procedures to be properly segregated and the results of their performance be adequately reviewed. This is normally accomplished by assigning duties so that no one person handles a transaction from beginning to end and incompatible duties between functions are not handled by the same person. Our management plans to explore implementing cost-effective measures to establish a more formal review process in an effort to reduce the risk of fraud and financial misstatements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDue to weaknesses in the Company's financial reporting controls specifically relating to inventory at the Aviation Ground Support Equipment segment, management believes there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected, as happened with our 2009 - 2012 annual financial statements. Management plans to explore implementing cost effective measures to improve its inventory reporting system in an effort to reduce the risk of a material misstatement of the financial statements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDue to the lack of expertise and personnel for financial reporting, the Company was not able to file required financial reports on time. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Company did not have effective controls to provide reasonable assurance as to the proper recognition and recording of receivables and revenue. Management plans to consult with third party advisors who are knowledgeable regarding revenue recognition in an effort to reduce the risk and material misstatement of the financial statements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Our management's report of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls and procedures was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDuring the year ended June 30, 2014, we implemented our remediation efforts related to the following material weaknesses reported in the Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDue to the limited number of Company personnel, a lack of segregation of duties exists. An essential part of internal control is for certain procedures to be properly segregated and the results of their performance to be adequately reviewed. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDue to weaknesses in the Company's financial reporting controls specifically relating to inventory, management believes there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected, as happened with our 2009 - 2012 annual financial statements. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Company did not have effective controls to provide reasonable assurance as to the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles around complex and/or non-routine transactions, including accounting for modifications to its subordinated convertible debentures. The Company lacked adequate technical expertise to apply proper accounting methods within the provisions of FASB ASC 470-50, \"Modifications and Extinguishments\", to account for modifications made to the debentures in 2011 and 2013. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDue to the lack of expertise and personnel for financial reporting, the Company was not able to file required financial reports on time. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAs a result of the remediation efforts noted below, there were improvements in internal control over financial reporting during the Year ended June 30, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. There were no other changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemediation Actions \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn response to these material weaknesses, we developed remediation plans to address the control deficiencies identified in fiscal year 2013. We implemented the following remediation actions during the year ended June 30, 2014: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSegregation of duties \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEngaged a third party specialist for advice and consultation \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided training and education to different accounting functions \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEstablished review controls \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Financial reporting control \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided training for calculating the cost of raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCompleted review of the Company's critical accounting and internal control policies with third party advisors that are knowledgeable regarding GAAP and internal controls \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided training and education relating to accounting for debt modifications and extinguishments \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHired third party advisors to assist in preparing consolidated financial statements \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn addition to the above steps, management intends to continue its remediation efforts by: \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvide ongoing training and education relating to GAAP around complex and non-routine transactions specifically identified through regular review of emerging issues and Company business activities. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCompleting our review with the assistance of a third party advisor of the Company's financial reporting controls and implementing recommended control procedures to strengthen the Company's control procedures in areas which involve significant judgements and estimates, which involve application of complex accounting methods under GAAP, or which could have a material impact on the accuracy of our financial statements. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWe are committed to a strong internal control environment, and believe that, when fully implemented, the remediation actions described above will represent significant improvements in the Company's accounting and financial reporting functions. The Company has hired a full-time controller and had made tremendous progress with improving the training and education of staff and added the additional internal control processes designed to remediate these material weaknesses during the balance of 2015. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our remediation efforts in connection with management's future evaluations of internal control over financial reporting. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 9B: OTHER INFORMATION \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChanges in Registrant's Certifying Accountant \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOn February 4, 2014, Oakridge Holdings, Inc. (the \"Company\") dismissed BDO USA, LLP (\"BDO\") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Company appointed BDO to replace Moquist Thorvilson Kauffmann LLC (\"MTK\") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm on August 6, 2013, which appointment was reported on the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on August 8, 2013. BDO audited the Company's financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2013and MTK audited the Company's financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2012. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the Company's fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The decision to dismiss BDO was approved by the Company's Audit Committee. During the Company's fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 and the subsequent interim period preceding BDO's and MTK's dismissal, there were: (i)no \"disagreements\" (within the meaning of Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K)between the Company and its independent registered public accounting firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of BDO's and MTK's, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in its reports on the consolidated financial statements of the Company; and (ii)except as noted below, no \"reportable events\" (as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn connection with its audit of the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company's independent registered public accounting firms reported the existence of material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting to the audit committee of the Company. These material weaknesses and remediation were mentioned in detail in Part II, Item 9A of the 10-K filed on December 19, 2013. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOn February 27, 2014, with the approval of its Audit Committee, the Company appointed Olsen Thielen & Co., Ltd. as its independent registered public accounting firm. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPART III \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITEM 10: \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe following information has been furnished to the Company, as of January 29, 2016, by the persons who are directors of the Company.

The Company may also engage in transactions with individuals who are, or are family members of, directors or officers of the Company. The Company has an unwritten policy under which the Audit Committee reviews these transactions to examine whether the transactions are conducted on an arm's length basis. The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to the Board whether to approve the proposed transaction, which the Board has historically always followed. In all cases, these related-party transactions have been conducted on an arm's length basis, and none of the transactions require more specific disclosure under applicable SEC rules and regulations, except as described below.\nDuring fiscal years 2014 and 2013, amounts expensed for non-audit compliance services provided by entities related to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Robert Harvey, were $25,585 and $13,327, respectively. The Company also has a month-to-month operating lease for office space from the Chief Executive Officer and the total rent expense was $ 27,000 and $36,000 under this lease in fiscal years 2014 and 2013.\nOn June 16, 2009, the Company entered into unwritten loan agreements with our Chief Executive Officer and Robert Gregor, the Company's Secretary and Vice President of Sales and Marketing. The aggregate principal amount of each loan, which is the largest amount of principal outstanding since the date of the loan was as follows: (1) due to Robert Harvey, $150,000 and (2) due to Robert Gregor, $150,000. The loans were repaid during fiscal year 2014.. Each of the loans described in this paragraph bears interest at the rate of 9.00% per annum, is unsecured and is payable on demand. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, interest of $50,567 was paid to Robert Gregor and $7,147 was paid to Robert Harvey.\nOn May 10, 2008, the Company agreed to issue $505,000 aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Convertible Subordinated Debentures to the following people for cash contributed by those people to the Company: (1) Robert Harvey, the Company's Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and a director, and (2) Robert Gregor, the Company's Secretary, the Vice President of Sales and Marketing of one of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries and a director. The aggregate principal amount of each debenture, which is the largest amount of principal outstanding since July 1, 2012 was as follows: (1) for Robert Harvey, $410,000 and (2) for Robert Gregor, $150,000. The loan was repaid during fiscal year 2014. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, interest of $18,450 was paid to Robert Harvey and $3,750 was paid to Robert Gregor. Each debenture accrued interest at the rate of 9.00% per annum, payable on January 1 of each year until the principal amount of the debenture has been paid in full or converted into the Company's Common Stock.\nThe principal amount of the debentures is convertible into the Company's Common Stock from the date of issuance until the principal amount is paid in full at a rate of one share of Common Stock for each $0.40 principal amount, subject to typical anti-dilution adjustments. The conversion price of the debentures is equal to the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock as determined by the Board as of the date of issuance.\nDirector Independence\nAll of the Company's directors, except for Robert Harvey and Robert Gregor, are \"independent\" as that term is defined in Rule 5605(a) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Marketplace Rules. That is the standard for independence the Company has chosen for purposes of the disclosure required in this report by SEC rules (even though the Company's Common Stock is not listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market).\nITEM 14:PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.\n\t\t\t\tAggregate fees for professional services rendered for the Company by Olsen Thielen & Co.

I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?15(e) and 15d\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and I have:\na) designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;\nb) designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under my supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;\nc) evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and\nd) disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?15(f) and 15d\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?15(f)) that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and\n5. I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):\na) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and\nb) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.\nDated: January 29, 2016\nBy /s/ ROBERT C.
