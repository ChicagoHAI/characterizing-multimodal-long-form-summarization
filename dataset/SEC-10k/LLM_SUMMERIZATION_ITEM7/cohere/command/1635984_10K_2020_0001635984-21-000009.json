MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor\u201d for forward-looking statements. Certain information contained herein or in other written or oral statements made by or on behalf of National Western Life Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") are or may be viewed as forward-looking. Although the Company has taken appropriate care in developing any such information, forward-looking information involves risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact actual results. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, matters described in the Company's filings such as exposure to market risks, anticipated cash flows or operating performance, future capital needs, and statutory or regulatory related issues. However, as a matter of policy, the Company does not make any specific projections as to future earnings, nor does it endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by others. Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments. Also, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) of National Western Life Group, Inc. (\"NWLGI\") for the three years ended December 31, 2020 follows. Where appropriate, discussion specific to the insurance operations of National Western Life Insurance Company is denoted by \"National Western\" or \"NWLIC\". This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page 96 of this report.\nEffective January 31, 2019, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Ozark National Life Insurance Company (\"Ozark National\") and N.I.S. Financial Services, Inc. (\"NIS\") following the receipt of regulatory approvals. NWLGI and National Western paid cash in an aggregate amount of approximately $205.4 million in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of Ozark National (wholly owned by National Western) and NIS (wholly owned by NWLGI). The eleven month results of Ozark National and NIS are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and reference to each is made in this MD&A where appropriate.\nOverview\nNational Western has historically provided life insurance products on a global basis for the savings and protection needs of policyholders and issued annuity contracts for the asset accumulation and retirement needs of contract holders, both domestic and international residents. As disclosed in the Company's 2018 filings, the Company discontinued accepting applications for its international life insurance products from all foreign residents in other countries in the second quarter of 2018.\nThe Company, National Western and Ozark National, accepts funds from policyholders or contract holders and establishes a liability representing future obligations to pay the policy or contract holders and their beneficiaries. To ensure the Company will be able to pay these future commitments, the funds received as premium payments and deposits are invested in high quality investments, primarily fixed income securities.\nDue to the business of accepting funds to pay future obligations in later years and the underlying economics, the relevant factors affecting the Company's overall business and profitability include the following:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>the level of sales and premium revenues collected </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>the volume of life insurance and annuity business in force </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>persistency of policies and contracts </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>the ability to price products to earn acceptable margins over benefit costs and expenses </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>return on investments sufficient to produce acceptable spread margins over interest crediting rates </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>investment credit quality which minimizes the risk of default or impairment </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>levels of policy benefits and costs to acquire business </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>the ability to manage the level of operating expenses </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>effect of interest rate changes on revenues and investments including asset and liability matching </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>maintaining adequate levels of capital and surplus </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>corporate tax rates and the treatment of financial statement items under tax rules and accounting </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>actual levels of surrenders, withdrawals, claims and interest spreads </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>changes in assumptions for amortization of deferred policy acquisition expenses and deferred sales inducements </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>changes in the fair value of derivative index options and embedded derivatives pertaining to fixed-index life and annuity products </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>pricing and availability of adequate counterparties for reinsurance and index option contracts </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>litigation subject to unfavorable judicial development, including the time and expense of litigation </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company monitors these factors continually as key business indicators. The discussion that follows in this Item 7 includes these indicators and presents information useful to an overall understanding of the Company's business performance in 2020, incorporating required disclosures in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nImpact of Recent Business Environment\nThe Company's business is generally aided by an economic environment experiencing growth, whether moderate or vibrant, characterized by improving employment data and increases in personal income. Important metrics indicating sustained economic growth over the longer term principally revolve around employment and confidence, both consumer and business sentiment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic not only affected how businesses conducted operations but also introduced a great deal of uncertainty to the life insurance industry. A relevant consideration for the industry was how might the morbidity exposure of COVID-19 translate into a higher death claim incidence. The Company (National Western and Ozark National) incurred approximately $8.0 million in net death claims for which COVID-19 was identified as the cause of death which did not result in total death claims significantly higher than historical experience. The more significant consequence of the pandemic was the impact on asset valuations. Invested assets declined in value due to downgrades in credit market securities resulting in impairment-related losses or sizable additions being made to the allowance for current credit losses in financial statements. Consequently, there has been balance sheet asset deterioration, charges to capital, and lower reported earnings.\nIn recent years, in an attempt to acquire additional investment yield in the low rate environment, life insurers substantially increased allocations to BBB- rated bonds. In a recession, many of these investment grade corporate credits are at risk for downgrades, as well as the potential to default. Risk-based capital (RBC) formulas assess higher required capital charges as investment quality declines. A meaningful shift of BBB- rated debt securities to non-investment grade categories could have significant implications in terms of required capital levels which would depress RBC ratios of impacted insurers. Life insurance companies also have a large exposure to real estate in its investment portfolios through commercial mortgage, direct real estate investment, alternative investment funds, and mortgage-backed securities. These investments are highly dependent upon occupancy and payment of rent and lease obligations. The quarantine and shelter-at-home lockdown affect the ability to meet these payment obligations.\nLife insurance revenues are driven more by renewal premiums than sales. Most state insurance departments have issued directives instructing insurers to allow premium payments to fall into arrears. New life insurance sales face the challenge of having to forego face-to-face consultation with agents and distributors. In addition, full medical underwriting, which is a cornerstone of evaluating risk when an insurer makes the decision to offer coverage and at what level of coverage, will likely be unavailable or difficult to complete as a medical test for life insurance applications will not be considered as \"essential\" in a pandemic environment.\nWith regard to the credit market, although not probable in the current environment, industry analysts and observers generally agree that a sudden jump in interest rate levels would be harmful to life insurers with interest-sensitive products as it could provide an impetus for abnormal levels of product surrenders and withdrawals at the same time fixed debt securities held by insurers declined in market value. Ultimately, a mix of monetary policy adjustments, fiscal policy, and economic fundamentals will determine the future direction of interest rate movements and the speed of such shifts. It is uncertain at what pace interest rate movements may occur in the future and what impact, if any, such movements would have on the Company's business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn an environment such as this, the need for a strong capital position that can cushion against unexpected bumps is critical for stability and ongoing business activity. The Company's operating strategy continues to be focused on maintaining capital levels substantially above regulatory and rating agency requirements. Our business model is predicated upon steady growth in invested assets while managing the block of business within profitability objectives. A key premise of our financial management is maintaining a high quality investment portfolio, well matched in terms of duration with policyholder obligations, that continues to outperform the industry with respect to adverse impairment experience. This discipline enables the Company to sustain resources more than adequate to fund future growth and absorb abnormal periods of cash outflows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAccounting policies discussed below are those considered critical to an understanding of the Company's financial statements.\nImpairment of Investment Securities. The Company's accounting policy requires that a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost basis be evaluated to determine if the decline is a result of credit loss. The primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for fixed income and equity securities without readily determinable fair values is a result of credit loss are: (a) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (b) the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, interest rate related, credit spread widening), (c) the overall financial condition as well as the near-term prospects of the issuer, (d) whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated principal and interest payments, and (e) that the Company does not intend or be required to sell the investment prior to recovery. In addition, certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows are evaluated periodically by the Company to update the estimated cash flows over the life of the security. If the Company determines that the fair value of the securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the previous purchase or prior impairment, then a credit loss charge is recognized. The Company would recognize impairment of securities due to changing interest rates or market dislocations only if the Company intended to sell the securities prior to recovery. When a security is deemed to be impaired, a charge is recorded equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security. In compliance with GAAP guidance the estimated credit loss is recorded as an allowance with changes in the allowance recorded to Net investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs ( DPAC\u201d). The Company is required to defer certain policy acquisition costs and amortize them over future periods. These costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are directly associated with acquiring new business. The deferred costs are recorded as an asset commonly referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs. The DPAC asset balance is subsequently charged to income over the lives of the underlying contracts in relation to the anticipated emergence of revenue or profits. Actual revenue or profits can vary from Company estimates resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization. The Company performs regular evaluations of its universal life and annuity contracts to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. Assumptions considered significant include surrender and lapse rates, mortality, expense levels, investment performance, and estimated interest spread. Should actual experience dictate that the Company change its assumptions regarding the emergence of future revenues or profits (commonly referred to as unlocking\u201d), the Company would record a charge or addition to bring its DPAC balance to the level it would have been if using the new assumptions from the inception date of each policy.\nDPAC is also subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing. These tests ensure that the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized DPAC balance to be amortized in the future. The present value of these cash flows, less the benefit reserve, is compared with the unamortized DPAC balance and if the DPAC balance is greater, the deficiency is charged to expense as a component of amortization and the asset balance is reduced to the recoverable amount. For more information about accounting for DPAC see Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nDeferred Sales Inducements (\"DSI\"). Costs related to sales inducements offered on sales to new customers, principally on investment type contracts and primarily in the form of additional credits to the customer's account value or enhancements to interest credited for a specified period, which are beyond amounts currently being credited to existing contracts, are deferred and recorded as other assets. All other sales inducements are expensed as incurred and included in interest credited to contract holders' funds. Deferred sales inducements are amortized to income using the same methodology and assumptions as DPAC, and are included in interest credited to contract holders' funds. Deferred sales inducements are also periodically reviewed for recoverability. For more information about accounting for deferred sales inducements see Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nValue of Business Acquired (\"VOBA\"). VOBA is a purchase accounting convention for life insurance companies in business combinations based upon an actuarial determination of the difference between the fair value of policyholder liabilities acquired and the same policyholder liabilities measured in accordance with the acquiring company's accounting policies. The difference, referred to as VOBA, is an intangible asset subject to periodic amortization. Similar to DPAC and DSI, VOBA is subject to periodic analysis assessing recoverability.\nFuture Policy Benefits. Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, the Company is liable for policy benefit payments many years into the future. The liability for future policy benefits represents estimates of the present value of the Company's expected benefit payments, net of the related present value of future net premium collections. For traditional life insurance contracts, this is determined by standard actuarial procedures, using assumptions as to mortality (life expectancy), morbidity (health expectancy), persistency, and interest rates, which are based on the Company's experience with similar products. The assumptions used are those considered to be appropriate at the time the policies are issued. An additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions assumed. For universal life and annuity products, the Company's liability is the amount of the contract's account balance. Account balances are also subject to minimum liability calculations as a result of minimum guaranteed interest rates in the policies. While management and Company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits, there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents the Company's ultimate obligation. In addition, significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts. A discussion of the assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nRevenue Recognition. Premium income for the Company's traditional life insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium becomes due from policyholders. For annuity and universal life contracts, the amounts collected from policyholders are considered deposits and are not included in revenue. For these contracts, fee income consists of policy charges for policy administration, cost of insurance charges and surrender charges assessed against policyholders' account balances which are recognized in the period the services are provided.\nInvestment activities of the Company are integral to its insurance operations. Since life insurance benefits may not be paid until many years into the future, the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested with income reported as revenue when earned. Anticipated yields on investments are reflected in premium rates, contract liabilities, and other product contract features. These anticipated yields are implied in the interest required on the Company's net insurance liabilities (future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs) and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products. The Company benefits to the extent actual net investment income exceeds the required interest on net insurance liabilities and manages the rates it credits on its products to maintain the targeted excess or spread\u201d of investment earnings over interest credited. The Company will continue to be required to provide for future contractual obligations in the event of a decline in investment yield. For more information concerning revenue recognition, investment accounting, and interest sensitivity, please refer to Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note (3), Investments, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, and the discussions under Investments in Item 7 of this report.\nPension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits. The Company sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan, which was frozen effective December 31, 2007, covering substantially all employees at that time, and three non-qualified defined benefit plans covering certain senior officers. In addition, the Company has postretirement health care benefits for certain senior officers. The freeze of the qualified benefit pension plan ceased future benefit accruals to all participants and closed the Plan to any new participants. In addition, all participants became immediately 100% vested in their accrued benefits as of that date. In accordance with prescribed accounting standards, the Company annually reviews plan assumptions.\nThe Company annually reviews its pension benefit plans' assumptions which include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the compensation increase rate. The assumed discount rate is set based on the rates of return on high quality long-term fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally set at the rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the plans, the various classes of the invested funds, input of the plan's investment advisors and consulting actuary, and the plan's historic rate of return. The compensation rate increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation. These assumptions involve uncertainties and judgment, and therefore actual performance may not be reflective of the assumptions.\nOther postretirement benefit assumptions include future events affecting retirement age, mortality, dependency status, per capita claims costs by age, health care trend rates, and discount rates. Per capita claims cost by age is the current cost of providing postretirement health care benefits for one year at each age from the youngest age to the oldest age at which plan participants are expected to receive benefits under the plan. Health care trend rates involve assumptions about the annual rate(s) of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided by the plan, due to factors other than changes in the composition of the plan population by age and dependency status. These rates implicitly consider estimates of health care inflation, changes in utilization, technological advances, and changes in health status of the participants.\nShare-Based Payments. Liability awards under a share-based payment arrangement have been measured based on the awards' fair value at the reporting date. The Black-Scholes valuation method is used to estimate the fair value of the options. This fair value calculation of the options includes assumptions relative to the following:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>exercise price </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>expected term based on contractual term and perceived future behavior relative to exercise </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>current price </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>expected volatility </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>risk-free interest rates </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>expected dividends </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese assumptions are continually reviewed by the Company and adjustments may be made based upon current facts and circumstances.\nOther significant accounting policies, although not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, but nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements, are described in Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). In addition, the Company regularly evaluates operating performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude or segregate derivative and realized investment gains and losses from operating revenues. Similar measures are commonly used in the insurance industry in order to assess profitability and results from ongoing operations. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the understanding of the Company's results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of the Company's business. The Company excludes or segregates derivative and realized investment gains and losses because such items are often the result of events which may or may not be at the Company's discretion and the fluctuating effects of these items could distort trends in the underlying profitability of the Company's business. Therefore, in the following sections discussing consolidated operations and segment operations, appropriate reconciliations have been included to report information management considers useful in enhancing an understanding of the Company's operations to reportable GAAP balances reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidated Operations\nRevenues. The following details Company revenues:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and annuity contract charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional life premiums </td> <td>92,542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,291 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives) </td> <td>402,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>429,081 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues </td> <td>18,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss) </td> <td>14,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80,004) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains (losses) </td> <td>21,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,423 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>694,742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>819,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>551,599 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUniversal life and annuity contract revenues - Revenues for universal life and annuity contract charges decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower surrender charge revenue from terminated policies and lower cost of insurance and administrative charges. Revenues for universal life and annuity products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances, less reinsurance premiums as depicted in the following table.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract Charges: </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of insurance and administrative charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129,591 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surrender charges </td> <td>26,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,138 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other charges </td> <td>11,430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,040 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contract revenues </td> <td>162,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172,769 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance premiums </td> <td>(17,469) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,578) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,564) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contract charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of insurance charges were $98.9 million in 2020 compared to $102.0 million in 2019 and $105.9 million in 2018. Cost of insurance charges typically trend with the size of the universal life insurance block in force and the amount of new business issued during the period. The volume of universal life insurance in force during 2020 decreased to $13.5 billion from $14.4 billion at year-end 2019 and $15.6 billion at year-end 2018. Administrative charges were $25.9 million, $24.1 million, and $23.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and correlate with new universal life insurance business sales by the number of policies placed, the amount of premiums received and the volume of insurance issued. While National Western's decision in the second quarter of 2018 to cease accepting international policy applications from residents of other countries significantly decreased the level of universal life insurance sales, the Company's increasing domestic life sales have served to offset a substantial portion of this decline.\nSurrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances upon withdrawal were $26.6 million in 2020 compared to $33.1 million in 2019 and $37.1 million in 2018. The Company earns surrender charge income that is assessed upon policy terminations, however, the Company's overall profitability is enhanced when policies remain in force and additional contract revenues are realized and the Company continues to make an interest rate spread equivalent to the difference it earns on its investment and the amounts that it credits to policyholders. While policy lapse rates in 2020 for the domestic life insurance and international life insurance segments were somewhat lower than those experienced in 2019, the annuities segment exhibited a higher lapse rate due to liquidity demands prompted by the pandemic crisis. Surrender charge income recognized is also dependent upon the duration of policies at the time of surrender (i.e. later duration policy surrenders have lower surrender charges assessed and earlier policy surrenders have a higher surrender charge assessed). The declining trend in assessed surrender charges is indicative of policy surrenders later in the surrender charge period.\nOther charges include the net amortization into income of the premium load on single premium life insurance products which is deferred at the inception of the policy. As these products have become a substantial portion of the Company's new business the amortization of accumulated deferrals has surpassed current premium loads being deferred. As part of the Company's annual unlocking analysis, a prospective unlocking of the unearned revenue reserve was done for each year shown. The effect of the unlocking was an increase in other charges revenue of $5.9 million, $0.5 million, and $0.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nTraditional life premiums - Traditional life premiums in 2019 include the activity of Ozark National subsequent to their acquisition on January 31, 2019. Ozark National's principal product is a non-participating whole life insurance policy with premiums remitted primarily on a monthly basis. The product is sold in tandem with a mutual fund investment product offered through its broker-dealer affiliate, NIS. Traditional life insurance premiums for products such as whole life and term life are recognized as revenues over the premium-paying period. A sizable portion of National Western's traditional life business resided in the International Life insurance segment which ceased accepting new applications in 2018. However, National Western's overall life insurance sales focus has historically been primarily centered around universal life products. The addition of Ozark National's business of repetitive paying permanent life insurance adds an important complement to National Western's life insurance sales. Included in the amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is $74.8 million and $69.0 million, respectively, of life insurance renewal premium from Ozark National. Universal life products, especially National Western's equity indexed universal life products, which offer the opportunity for consumers to acquire life insurance protection and receive credited interest linked in part to an outside market index, have been the more popular product offerings in the Company's markets.\nNet investment income (with and without derivatives) - A detail of net investment income is provided below.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross investment income: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt and equities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>373,479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>403,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>399,645 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans </td> <td>13,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,066 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy loans </td> <td>3,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments </td> <td>2,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,249 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other invested assets </td> <td>12,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,289 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income </td> <td>404,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>435,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430,434 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: investment expenses </td> <td>2,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,353 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives) </td> <td>402,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>429,081 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss) </td> <td>14,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80,004) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>417,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>555,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>349,077 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt and equity securities generated approximately 92% of total investment income, excluding derivative gains and losses, in 2020 compared to 93% in 2019. The Company's strategy is to invest substantially all of its cash flows in fixed debt securities within its guidelines for credit quality, duration, and diversification. The higher level of investment income from debt and equity securities in 2019 versus 2018 reflects the addition of Ozark National. National Western's debt and equity securities investment income continues to experience higher yielding debt securities maturing or being called by borrowers and being replaced with lower yielding securities in the current interest rate environment. In addition, the excess of annuity outflows over inflows has caused the debt security portfolio to contract. With the acquisition of Ozark National and NIS in the first quarter of 2019, a substantial portion of National Western's investable cash resources were applied toward the purchase of the two companies and then subsequently to pay back line of credit borrowings of $75 million used to fund a part of the acquisition price.\nThe Company's investable funds are derived from incremental cash flow from new business and investment income from its portfolio above its operational requirements to pay policy benefits, commissions, and expenses. The debt securities portfolio increased from $10.2 billion at December 31, 2018 to $10.5 billion at December 31, 2019, reflecting the addition of Ozark National's $722.9 million debt security portfolio. The debt securities portfolio increased back to $10.8 billion at December 31, 2020, however the increase in balance was the result of recording certain holdings at fair value instead of amortized cost as had been done previously. Investment yields on new bond purchases in 2020 were less than the portfolio's weighted average yield after exceeding the portfolio yield in 2018 and 2019. The portfolio weighted average yield was approximately 3.68% at December 31, 2020, while the yield on debt security purchases to fund insurance operations was 3.33%, 4.06%, and 4.20% in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Ozark National's weighted average portfolio yield at December 31, 2020 was 3.66%. Although the yield on new purchases in 2018 and 2019 exceeded the portfolio weighted average yield, bond portfolio yields have continued to be impacted by higher yielding debt securities maturing or being called by borrowers with the proceeds being reinvested into lower yielding securities.\nEffective January 1, 2018, new accounting guidance required changes in fair values of equity securities to be included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings rather than as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Stockholders' Equity. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 an unrealized gain(loss) of $(1.0) million, $3.5 million, and ($1.8) million, respectively, has been included in net investment income reflecting the change in fair value of equity securities during the periods. The carrying value of the Company's portfolio of equity securities was $17.7 million at December 31, 2020.\nPrior to 2020, the Company's new mortgage loan activity had been impacted by the low level of rates and the highly competitive underwriting of commercial properties. The pandemic COVID-19 crisis further slowed down the underwriting of new loan applications early in 2020 until clarity regarding the impacts of closing down the economy upon commercial real estate became discernible. Eventually the volume of new mortgage loan originations during the latter half of 2020 approached the pace of that in 2019. The Company originated new mortgage loans in the amount of $80.2 million in 2020 as compared to $121.4 in 2019. Mortgage loan investment income also benefits from incremental contributions from loan prepayment fees and profit participation receipts.\nPolicy loan and other invested asset balances outstanding have remained relatively stable over the past few years. During the latter part of 2020, National Western, in order to obtain incremental investment yield, expanded its invested asset vehicles to include alternative investments. These assets are typically syndicated, targeted capital pools with specific investment objectives managed by investment firms having specific expertise in designated asset opportunities. At December 31, 2020, the Company held $28.9 million in this investment category.\nThe Company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to current expected credit losses on financial instruments (\"CECL\") in 2020. The adoption as of January 1, 2020 was reported as a change in accounting with initial balances recorded and charged to retained earnings. Remeasurement of the CECL allowance during 2020 resulted in a decrease in the allowance of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which is netted in gross investment income.\nIn order to evaluate underlying profitability and results from ongoing operations, net investment income performance is analyzed excluding derivative gain (loss), which is a common practice in the insurance industry. Although this is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, Company management believes this financial measure provides useful supplemental information by removing the swings associated with fair value changes on derivative instruments. Net investment income and average invested assets shown below includes cash and cash equivalents. Net investment income performance is summarized as follows:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excluding derivatives: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>402,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>429,081 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average invested assets, at amortized cost </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,994,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,881,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,758,315 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual yield on average invested assets </td> <td> </td> <td>3.66 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.97 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.99 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Including derivatives: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>417,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>555,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>349,077 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average invested assets, at amortized cost </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,139,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,967,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,863,022 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual yield on average invested assets </td> <td> </td> <td>3.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.07 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decline in average invested asset yield, excluding derivatives, from 2018 to 2019 and to 2020 is due to the Company continuing to obtain low yields on newly invested cash inflows as higher yielding assets mature or are called. The pattern in average invested asset yield, including derivatives, incorporates increases and decreases in the fair value of index options purchased by National Western to support its fixed-index products. Fair values of the purchased call options recorded net gains in 2020 and 2019 while recording a loss in 2018 corresponding to the movement in the S&P 500 Index\u00ae during these periods (the primary index the fixed-index products employ). Refer to the derivatives discussion following this section for a more detailed explanation.\nOther revenues - Other revenues pertain to NIS, the broker-dealer affiliate of Ozark National; the operations of Braker P III (\"BP III\"), a new subsidiary created at the end of 2016 to own and manage a commercial office building BP III acquired; and the Company's previously owned two nursing home operations in Reno, Nevada and San Marcos, Texas.\nNIS revenues were $9.9 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. NIS revenues in 2019 were for the period subsequent to its acquisition effective January 31, 2019.\nRevenues associated with BP III were $4.7 million, $3.9 million and $3.2 million in December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, reflecting additional tenant leases subsequently executed. The facility is currently fully leased.\nThe Company closed on the sale of its Reno nursing home operations effective February 1, 2019 and on the sale of its San Marcos nursing home operations effective May 1, 2019. Revenues associated with these operations were $(0.6) million, $4.3 million and $17.2 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating revenues for each nursing home entity were included in 2019 through their respective dates of sale. In addition, net gains from the sale of personal property and equipment at the Reno facility of $1.4 million are included in 2019 revenues.\nThe Company's acquisition of Ozark National (by National Western) included a contingent payment provision that was dependent upon the subsequent persistency of Ozark National's in force block of business that was acquired. The Company had been progressively accruing for this potential obligation in its financial statements. During 2020, the Company executed an agreement with the seller under which both parties agreed that the Company had fulfilled its payment obligation under the Stock Purchase Agreement executed October 3, 2018. Consequently, the Company reversed the contingent payment amounts previously accrued and recognized as Other revenues $4.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther revenues also include semi-annual distributions from the life interest in the Libbie Shearn Moody Trust. Revenues recognized from these distributions were $5.3 million, $6.7 million, and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nDerivative gain (loss) - Index options are derivative financial instruments used to hedge the equity return component of National Western's fixed-index products. Derivative gain or loss includes the amounts realized from the sale or expiration of the options. Since the index options do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP, they are marked to fair value on each reporting date and the resulting unrealized gain or loss is reflected as a component of net investment income. As the options hedging the notional amount of policyholder contract obligations are purchased as close as possible to like amounts, the amount of the options returns tend to correlate closely with indexed interest credited.\nGains and losses from index options are substantially due to changes in equity market conditions. Index options are intended to act as hedges to match the returns on the product's underlying reference index and the rise or decline in the index relative to the index level at the time of the option purchase which causes option values to likewise rise or decline. As income from index options fluctuates with the underlying index, the contract interest expense to policyholder accounts for the Company's fixed-index products also fluctuates in a similar manner and direction. The Company recorded derivative gain (loss) and contract interest amounts as shown below.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,740) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(191,654) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gain (loss) </td> <td>24,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,786) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,650 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gain (loss) included in net investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80,004) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contract interest </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,055 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe economic impact of option performance in the Company's financial statements is not generally determined solely by the option gain or loss included in net investment income as there is a corresponding amount recorded in the contract interest expense line. The Company's profitability with respect to these options is largely dependent upon the purchase cost of the option remaining within the financial budget for acquiring options embedded in the product pricing. Option prices vary with interest rates, volatility, and dividend yields among other things. As option prices vary, the Company manages for the variability by making offsetting adjustments to product caps, participation rates, and management fees. For the periods shown, the Company's option costs have generally been within the product pricing budgets.\nThe financial statement investment spread, the difference between investment income and interest credited to contract holders, is subject to variations from option performance during any given period. For example, many of the Company's equity-index annuity products provide for the collection of asset management fees. These asset management fees are assessed when returns on expiring options are positive, and they are collected prior to passing any additional returns above the assessed management fees to the policy contractholders. During periods of positive returns, the collected asset management fees serve to increase the financial statement spread by increasing option realized gains reported as investment income in an amount greater than interest credited to policy contractholders which is reported as contract interest expense. Asset management fees collected in 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $30.7 million, $15.9 million, and $24.3 million, respectively.\nNet realized investment gains (losses) - Realized gains (losses) on investments generally include proceeds from bond calls, sales and impairment write-downs, as well as gains and losses on the sale of real estate property. Net gains reported in 2020 consisted of gross gains of $21.1 million which were mostly from bond calls, offset by gross losses of $0.0 million. Included the year ended December 31, 2019 gross gains is $5.7 million from the sale of land and building associated with the nursing home in Reno, Nevada and a $3.2 million gain on the sale of the Company's former Austin, Texas home office facility. Included in 2019 gross losses is a $2.0 million loss on the sale of the building pertaining to the San Marcos, Texas nursing home and an other-than-temporary impairment on a single debt security credit in the amount $7.8 million. Included in the gross gains in 2018 is $1.8 million from the sale of two buildings adjacent to the former home office property located in Austin, Texas which housed portions of National Western's operations.\nPrior to January 1, 2020 and the adoption of the new accounting guidance on current expected credit losses, the Company recorded impairment write-downs when a decline in value was considered to be other-than-temporary and full recovery of the investment is not expected. Impairments due to credit factors were recorded in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings while non-credit (liquidity) impairment losses were included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Under the new accounting guidance, credit loss allowances for available-for-sale debt securities are recorded following the same process previously applied for impairment accounting. Credit loss allowances are recorded through net investment income in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Impairment or valuation write-downs recorded prior to January 1, 2020 were completed under accounting guidance prior to adoption of the accounting standard update 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses and totaled $7.8 million and $0.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nBenefits and Expenses. The following details benefits and expenses.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life and other policy benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,297 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired </td> <td>140,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and annuity contract interest </td> <td>206,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,055 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses </td> <td>104,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93,969 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>582,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>654,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>410,092 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLife and other policy benefits - Life and other policy benefits include death claims of $72.5 million, $65.8 million and $44.9 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in the amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are $37.0 million and $29.3 million in death claims pertaining to Ozark National. Death claim amounts are subject to variation from period to period. Death claims in 2020 include net benefit amounts (after reinsurance) pertaining to death from COVID-19 of $5.1 million for National Western and $2.8 million for Ozark National. In 2020, the number of National Western life insurance claims increased 12% from 2019 and the average dollar amount per net claim declined 10% to $43,600. National Western's mortality experience has generally been consistent with or better than its product pricing assumptions. The average net claim for Ozark National during 2020 declined to $14,800 from the 2019 period amount of $15,300. The average face amount of insurance in force for Ozark National was $33,700 at December 31, 2020. Mortality exposure is managed through reinsurance treaties under which the Company's retained maximum net amount at risk on any one life is capped at $500,000. Ozark National's retained maximum net amount at risk is capped at $200,000 under its reinsurance treaties with limited exceptions related to the conversion of child protection and guaranteed insurability riders.\nLife and other policy benefits also includes policy liabilities held associated with the Company's traditional life products, including riders such as the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider (\"WBR\"), a popular rider to National Western's equity-indexed annuity products. The increases in these liabilities for National Western were $10.7 million, $24.4 million, and $7.3 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In each of these years, National Western unlocked its policy benefit reserves associated with the WBR which resulted in an increase(decrease) to the policy benefit liability of $(11.9) million, $0.7 million, and ($15.7) million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The 2020 adjustment included an unlocking amount pertaining to mortality experience on payout annuities with life contingencies.\nLife and other policy benefits in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 includes changes in traditional life reserves and miscellaneous benefit payments associated with Ozark National's operations of $30.7 million and $30.5 million, respectively, reflecting normal business conditions. The amounts for 2019 reflect activity subsequent to the acquisition date of January 31, 2019.\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired - Life insurance companies are required to defer certain expenses that vary with, and are directly related to, the cost of acquiring new business. The majority of these acquisition expenses consist of commissions paid to agents, underwriting costs, and certain marketing expenses. Recognition of these deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) as an expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements occurs over future periods in relation to the expected emergence of profits priced into the products sold. This emergence of profits is based upon assumptions regarding premium payment patterns, mortality, persistency, investment performance, and expense patterns. Companies are required to review universal life and annuity contract assumptions periodically to ascertain whether actual experience has deviated significantly from that assumed. If it is determined that a significant deviation has occurred, the emergence of profits pattern is to be \"unlocked\" and reset based upon the actual experience. DPAC balances are also adjusted each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience ( true-up\u201d) with the adjustment reflected in current period amortization expense. In accordance with GAAP guidance, the Company must also write off deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue liabilities upon internal replacement of certain contracts as well as annuitizations of deferred annuities.\nThe following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization expense components for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DPAC </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,643) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(950) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other amortization components </td> <td>107,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,721 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amortization amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were comprised of DPAC amortization by National Western of $129.7 million and $108.4 million and by Ozark National of $0.6 million and $0.7 million. Ozark National's deferred policy acquisition cost balance was initiated February 1, 2019 following its acquisition by National Western.\nIn 2020, the Company unlocked its DPAC balances for: (1) mortality rates, lapse rates, portfolio yield rates and spreads, which collectively decreased DPAC balances (and increased amortization expense) on its Life segment by $7.4 million; and (2) surrender rates, annuitization rates, portfolio yield rates and spreads, mortality experience on payout annuities, and utilization of the Company's withdrawal benefit rider which collectively decreased DPAC balances (and increased amortization expense) on its Annuity segment by $15.0 million.\nIn 2019, the Company unlocked its DPAC balances for: (1) mortality rates, lapse rates, portfolio yield rates and spreads, and maintenance expense on its International life business which collectively increased DPAC balances (and reduced amortization expense) on its Life segment by $11.2 million; and (2) surrender rates, annuitization rates, portfolio yield rates and spreads, and utilization of the Company's withdrawal benefit rider which collectively decreased DPAC balances (and increased amortization expense) on its Annuity segment by $2.6 million.\nIn 2018, the Company unlocked its DPAC balances associated with its Life and Annuity segments for: (1) mortality, extended death benefit reserves, and the investment yield supporting universal life policy liabilities on its Life segment which collectively increased amortization expense by $1.2 million; and (2) mortality, the election rate of the Company's withdrawal benefit rider, and the investment yield supporting annuity contract accounts which collectively decreased amortization expense by $2.2 million for the Annuity segment.\nAs the DPAC balance is an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, GAAP provides for an earned interest return on the unamortized balance each period. The earned interest serves to increase the DPAC balance and reduce other amortization component expense. The rate at which the DPAC balance earns interest is the average credited interest rate on universal life and annuity policies in force, including credited interest on equity-indexed policies. The amount of earned interest on DPAC balances recorded was $17.2 million, $12.0 million, and $29.1 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, decreasing other amortization component expense. The reduced interest amount in 2019 reflects lower realized returns on equity-index products.\nAs part of the purchase accounting required with the acquisition of Ozark National effective January 31, 2019, the Company recorded an intangible asset of $145.8 million referred to as the value of business acquired (\"VOBA\"). VOBA represents the difference between the acquired assets and liabilities of Ozark National measured in accordance with the Company's accounting policies and the fair value of these same assets and liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the cash value of certain acquired reserves was increased which resulted in a commensurate $35.1 million increase in both the traditional life reserve liability and the related VOBA balance reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The VOBA balance sheet amount is amortized following a methodology similar to that used for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company's VOBA amortization was $10.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively.\nUniversal life and annuity contract interest - The Company closely monitors its credited interest rates on interest sensitive policies (National Western products), taking into consideration such factors as profitability goals, policyholder benefits, product marketability, and economic market conditions. As long-term interest rates change, the Company's credited interest rates are often adjusted accordingly, taking into consideration the factors described above. The difference between yields earned on investments over policy credited rates is often referred to as the \"interest spread.\"\nNational Western's approximated average credited rates, excluding and including equity-indexed products, were as follows:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Excluding fixed-index products) </td> <td> </td> <td>(Including fixed-index products) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity </td> <td>1.92 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.07 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest sensitive life </td> <td>3.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.88 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.61 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContract interest reported in financial statements also encompasses the performance of the index options associated with the Company's fixed-index products. As previously noted, the market value changes of these derivative features resulted in net realized and unrealized gains/(losses) in 2020, 2019, and 2018 of $14.8 million, $123.2 million, and $(80.0) million, respectively. In 2020, this figure was comprised of unrealized losses totaling $(9.7) million offset by realized gains of $24.5 million. In 2019, the amount consisted of unrealized gains of $153.0 million offset by realized losses of $(29.8) million. These returns similarly increased/(decreased) the computed average credited rates for the periods shown above. Policyholders of equity-indexed products cannot receive an interest credit below 0% according to the policy contract terms.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract Interest Expense </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve changes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,764 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments </td> <td> </td> <td>17,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,904 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset management fees collected </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,675) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,856) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,266) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected asset management fees </td> <td> </td> <td>34,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,600) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,650 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other embedded derivative components </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,188) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,214) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,900) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,838 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContract interest expense includes reserve changes for immediate annuities, two tier annuities, excess death benefit reserves, excess annuitizations, and amortization of deferred sales inducement balances. These items are offset by policy charges assessed for policies having the withdrawal benefit rider (WBR). As changes in these items collectively impact contract interest expense, financial statement interest spread is also affected. Netted against reserve changes in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 are WBR assessed policy charges of $24.8 million, $23.8 million, and $23.7 million, respectively.\nGenerally, the impact of the market value change of index options on asset values aligns closely with the movement of the embedded derivative liability held for the Company's fixed-index products such that the net effect upon pretax earnings is negligible (i.e. net realized and unrealized gains/(losses) included in net investment income approximate the change in contract interest associated with the corresponding embedded derivative liability change). However, other aspects of the embedded derivatives can cause deviations to occur between the change in index option asset values included in net investment income and the change in the embedded derivative liability included in contract interest. As noted in the discussion of net investment income, the collection of asset management fees in a period can cause investment income to increase marginally higher than contract interest expense since these collected fees are deducted from indexed interest credited to policyholders. The asset management fees collected as shown above reflect the level of realized option gains incurred during these periods.\nAccounting rules require the embedded derivative liability to include a projection of asset management fees estimated to be collected in the succeeding fiscal year due to the Company's historical practice of purchasing options priced to incorporate an expected probability of collecting asset management fees (referred to as \"at the money hedging\"). This projection for the embedded derivative liability is based upon the most recent performance of the reference equity index. Increases in projected asset management fees to be collected reduce contract interest expense while decreases in projected asset management fees to be collected increase contract interest expense. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, contract interest was increased/(decreased) by $34.4 million, $(33.6) million, and $17.6 million, respectively, for the projected change in asset management fees to be collected. During 2020, the Company changed its embedded derivative hedging process to incorporate \"out of the money\" hedging which reduces option costs and eliminates probability projections of collected asset management fees going forward. As the current inventory of annual hedges under the prior method continue to roll over during 2021, the embedded derivative liability component for projected asset management fees to be collected will be phased out. Refer to Note (3) Derivative Investments in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information.\nOther embedded derivative components include changes pertaining to other modeling differences, changes in future interest adjustments, and the change in the host contract component of the embedded derivative products. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company incurred an additional charge to contract interest of $12.1 million pertaining to an assumption regarding the embedded derivative option budget which was made several years ago when the Company's investment portfolio yield was higher. The combination of the embedded derivative option budget being out of date relative to the Company's current investment portfolio yield and the historically low interest rate levels introduced an embedded derivative floor which prevented the Company's contract interest expense from declining in tandem with the option value decreases recorded in net investment income. The Company subsequently unlocked for this out of date embedded derivative option budget assumption to reflect the Company's current investment portfolio yield. The effect of the unlocking was to remove the embedded derivative floor and reverse the contract interest charge recorded in the first quarter of 2020 so that there was no effect for this occurrence for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAnother contract interest expense component is the amortization of deferred sales inducements. Similar to deferred policy acquisition costs, the Company defers sales inducements in the form of first year credited interest bonuses on annuity products that are directly related to the production of new business. These bonus interest charges are deferred and amortized using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize other capitalized acquisition costs and the amortization is included in contract interest. In addition, deferred sales inducement balances (\"DSI\") are also reviewed periodically to ascertain whether actual experience has deviated significantly from that assumed (unlock) and are adjusted to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies compared to anticipated experience (true-up). These adjustments, plus or minus, are included in contract interest expense. As part of the DPAC balance unlockings for the Annuity segment previously discussed for 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company also unlocked its DSI balance. The effect of these prospective unlockings was to increase/(decrease) the DSI balance by $(4.4) million, $(0.6) million, and $1.3 million, respectively. These amounts are included in the previous table in the Unlocking adjustments line.\nOther operating expenses - Other operating expenses consist of general administrative expenses, licenses and fees, commissions not subject to deferral, nursing home expenses, real estate expenses, brokerage expenses, and compensation costs. These are summarized in the table that follows.\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General insurance expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,028 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nursing home expenses </td> <td>102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,935 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation expenses </td> <td>30,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,340 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission expenses </td> <td>11,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,816 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate expenses </td> <td>5,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokerage expenses (NIS) </td> <td>5,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes, licenses and fees </td> <td>9,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,725 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93,969 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral insurance expenses include software amortization of previously capitalized information technology expenditures including National Western's proprietary policy administration system which was phased into production over the past several years. Software costs, including amortization expense, for 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $12.6 million, $12.7 million, and $11.3 million, respectively. This category of expenses also includes employee benefit plan expenses for the various health and retirement plans the Company sponsors. Related expenses for these items were $13.0 million, $8.1 million, and $6.6 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The increasing trend reflects actuarial expenses of an unfunded non-qualified defined benefit plan. Refer to Note (14) Pension and Other Postretirement Plans in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for a discussion of financial statement expenses of the Company's defined benefit pension plans. General insurance expenses also include payments and provisions made relating to potential or contingent legal liabilities and legal fees. Expenses in this category were $2.8 million, $3.8 million, and $1.4 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The 2018 amount reflects settlement of an annuity contract matter in Puerto Rico and the release of the excess provision of $1.9 million previously recorded. General insurance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 include a $3.3 million broker fee paid in connection with the acquisition of Ozark National and NIS which closed early in 2019. GAAP precludes this fee from being part of the purchase price for acquiring these businesses. General insurance expenses in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 include Ozark National expenses in the amount of $4.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively.\nNursing home expenses reflect the operations of the Company's two facilities which were sold during 2019. The Reno, Nevada nursing home was sold effective February 1, 2019, while the San Marcos, Texas nursing home sale closed effective May 1, 2019. Expenses shown for 2019 reflect operations up to the date of sale for each facility. The Company must maintain the legal entities for a specified time period subsequent to each sale and incur various record safekeeping and other administrative expenses in the interim.\nCompensation expenses include share-based compensation costs related to outstanding vested and nonvested stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), and performance share units (\"PSUs\"). The related share-based compensation costs move in tandem not only with the number of awards outstanding but also with the movement in the market price of the Company's Class A common stock as a result of marking the SARs, RSUs, and PSUs to fair value under the liability method of accounting. Consequently, the related expense amount varies positive or negative in any given period. In the amounts shown above, share-based compensation expense totaled $(2.2) million in 2020, $2.4 million in 2019 and $1.4 million in 2018. The negative expense level in 2020 reflects a change in the Company's Class A common share price to $206.44 at December 31, 2020 from $290.88 at December 31, 2019. In addition to the changes in price of the Company's Class A common shares, there were 40,990, 20,380, and 12,590 SARs granted to officers in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Refer to Note (12) Stockholders' Equity in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report for a discussion of performance share awards.\nCommission expenses in 2020 and 2019 include Ozark National non-deferrable commissions of $3.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively.\nReal estate expenses pertain to the commercial building operated by Braker P III. The building was acquired at year-end 2016 and National Western relocated to this facility during the fourth quarter of 2017. The trending increase in the level of operating expenses reflects the addition of new tenants and associated operating expenses. At December 31, 2020, the facility was fully occupied.\nTaxes, licenses and fees include premium taxes and licensing fees paid to state insurance departments, guaranty fund assessments, the company portion of social security and Medicare taxes, real estate taxes, state income taxes, and other state and municipal taxes. Ozark National taxes, licenses and fees were $2.3 million in 2020 and $2.2 million in 2019.\nSegment Operations\nSummary of Segment Earnings\nA summary of segment earnings from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is provided below.

domestic life insurance operations include life insurance premiums on traditional type products and contract revenues from universal life insurance. Revenues from traditional products are simply premiums collected, while revenues from universal life insurance consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration fees, and surrender charges assessed during the period. A comparative detail of premiums and contract revenues is provided below.\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,371 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional life insurance premiums </td> <td>4,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,552 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance premiums </td> <td>(11,179) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,945) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,044) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNational Western's domestic life insurance in force, in terms of policy counts, has been declining for some time. The pace of new policies issued has lagged the number of policies terminated from death or surrender causing a declining level of policies in force from which contract revenue is received. Consequently, the number of domestic life insurance policies in force has declined from 49,000 at December 31, 2018 to 47,900 at December 31, 2019 and to 46,900 at December 31, 2020. Policy lapse rates in 2020 decreased to 6.0% from 6.2% in 2019. While policy counts have declined, the face amount of life insurance in force has increased from $3.2 billion at December 31, 2018 to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2020.\nUniversal life insurance revenues are also generated with the issuance of new business based upon amounts per application and percentages of the face amount (volume) of insurance issued. The number of domestic policies issued during 2020 was level with that in 2019 and the volume of insurance issued increased less than 1% from that in 2019.\nUniversal life insurance revenues also include surrender charge income realized on terminating policies and, in the case of domestic universal life, amortization into income of the premium load on single premium policies which is deferred. Amounts deferred are amortized into revenues over future periods corresponding with the duration of the policies. The net premium load amortization associated with this activity was $11.4 million, $8.2 million, and $6.0 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The net amortization amount in 2020 includes $5.8 million from the Company's annual unlocking of actuarial assumptions.\nPremiums collected on universal life products are not reflected as revenues in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings in accordance with GAAP. Actual domestic universal life premiums collected are detailed below.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First year and single premiums </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169,363 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewal premiums </td> <td>17,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>198,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188,901 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the past several years, sales have been substantially weighted toward single premium policies which do not have much in the way of recurring premium payments. These products are targeting wealth transfer strategies involving the movement of accumulated wealth in alternative investment vehicles, including annuities, into life insurance products. As a result, renewal premium levels have not been exhibiting a corresponding level of increase.\nNet investment income for this segment of business, excluding derivative gain/(loss), has been gradually increasing due to the increased new business activity described above (single premium policies) and a higher level of investments needed to support the corresponding growth in policy obligations, especially those for single premium policies. The increase in net investment income has been partially muted by lower investment yields from debt security investment purchases during this time frame. Net investment income also includes the gains and losses on index options purchased to back the index crediting mechanism on fixed-index universal life products. A detail of net investment income for domestic life insurance operations is provided below.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,123 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss) </td> <td>7,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,544) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,672 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,579 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance contract interest </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,826 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLife and policy benefits for a smaller block of business are subject to variation from period to period. Claim count activity during 2020 increased 12% compared to 2019 while the average net claim amount decreased to $30,600 from $34,400. Of the increase in claim count in 2020 over 2019, approximately half was due to COVID-19 death claims. National Western's domestic life insurance segment incurred 70 COVID-19 claims with a net benefit amount (after reinsurance) of $2.4 million, roughly 6% of the total net claims for this segment. The low face amount per claim relative to the current issued amounts of insurance per policy reflects the older block of domestic life insurance policies sold which were final expense type products (i.e. purchased to cover funeral costs). The overall mortality experience for this segment has been consistent with pricing assumptions.\nAs noted previously in the discussion of results from Consolidated Operations, true-up adjustments are recorded to DPAC balances each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience with the adjustment reflected in current period amortization expense. To the extent required, unlocking adjustments may also be recorded to DPAC balances. The following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on domestic life insurance DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization expense components for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DPAC </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(360) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other amortization components </td> <td>10,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,524 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,539 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2020, DPAC balances were unlocked for this segment for mortality, lapse rates, and investment spread increasing amortization expense. In 2019, DPAC balances were unlocked for this segment for mortality rates, lapse rates, and portfolio yield rates (investment spread margin) which cumulatively had the effect of slightly increasing DPAC balances (and reducing amortization expense). In 2018, the Company unlocked DPAC balances associated with the Domestic Life segment for favorable mortality, extended death benefit reserves, and the investment portfolio yield supporting universal life policy liabilities.\nAlthough not an unlocking, in 2018 the Company successfully converted its reserve modeling for excess death benefit reserves on UL riders to its existing actuarial software platform. The implementation refined the estimate increasing reserves and included an adjustment decreasing the Domestic Life DPAC balance (increasing amortization expense). The amount of the amortization expense increase was $0.8 million.\nIn the results from Consolidated Operations discussion of amortization of deferred acquisition costs it was noted that interest earned on DPAC balances serves to offset (decrease) amortization expense and that the interest rate used is the crediting rate experience during the period. The decrease in the core amortization expense in 2020 relative to 2019 reflects higher interest earned on universal life DPAC balances in 2019 due to the increased crediting rates resulting from better index option returns.\nContract interest expense includes the fluctuations that are the result of the effect upon the embedded derivative for the performance of the underlying equity indices associated with fixed-indexed universal life products. For liability purposes, the embedded option in the Company's policyholder obligations for this feature is bifurcated and reserved for separately. Accordingly, the impact for the embedded derivative component in the equity-index universal life product is reflected in contract interest expense for approximately the same amounts as in net investment income for each respective period.\nContract interest also includes certain policy reserve balance changes which are also subject to unlocking adjustments in conjunction with DPAC. As part of the 2020 and 2019 unlockings discussed above, the Company increased/(decreased) its domestic life insurance excess benefit reserve balance by $1.4 million in 2020 (increasing contract interest expense) and increased its excess benefit reserve balance by $0.3 million in 2019 (increasing contract interest expense).\nOperating expenses are allocated to lines of business based upon a functional cost analysis of the business activity giving rise to incurred expenses. With the Company's decision to cease accepting applications from international residents and the lower level of annuity sales, a higher proportion of operating expenses were allocated to the Domestic Life segment in 2020 and 2019 given the increase in activity in this segment and its greater share of the overall operational resources.\nInternational Life Insurance Operations\nA comparative analysis of results of operations for the Company's international life insurance segment is detailed below.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums and other revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums and contract revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,923 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td>27,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total premiums and other revenue </td> <td>115,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,613 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefits and expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life and other policy benefits </td> <td>14,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,333 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs </td> <td>24,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance contract interest </td> <td>(2,087) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses </td> <td>17,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,593 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total benefits and expenses </td> <td>54,755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,665 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,874 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment earnings before Federal income taxes </td> <td>60,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,739 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for Federal income taxes </td> <td>9,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,035 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,704 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs with Domestic Life operations, revenues from the International Life insurance segment include both premiums on traditional type products and contract revenues from universal life insurance.

Over the past three years, the volume of insurance in force for this segment has contracted from $15.4 billion at December 31, 2018 to $13.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and to $12.4 billion at December 31, 2020. The decline in volume of in force reflects the decision at the end of 2015 to begin disengaging from certain countries and ultimately making the decision in 2018 to cease accepting international policy applications from residents from all remaining countries. Universal life insurance revenues are also generated with the issuance of new business based upon amounts per application and percentages of the face amount (volume) of insurance issued. No policies have been issued since September 2018.\nA third component of international universal life revenues include surrender charges assessed upon surrender of contracts by policyholders. In addition to the trend in the termination rate decreasing, the resulting additional surrender charge fee revenue lessens as lower surrender charge fees are assessed later in the contract term according to the policy contract provisions. The following table illustrates National Western's recent international life termination experience.\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume In Force Terminations </td> <td>Amount in $'s </td> <td> </td> <td>Annualized Termination Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,295.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td>1,671.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2018 </td> <td>1,706.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2017 </td> <td>2,309.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2016 </td> <td>2,340.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs noted previously, premiums collected on universal life products are not reflected as revenues in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings in accordance with GAAP.

These products issued were not generally available in the local markets when sold. Included in the totals in the above table are collected premiums for fixed-index universal life products of approximately $32.4 million, $41.3 million and $57.8 million for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The declining trend in renewal premiums during these periods corresponds with the decline in policies in force due to the elimination of new sales and the termination activity as discussed above.\nAs previously noted, net investment income and contract interest include period-to-period changes in fair values pertaining to call options purchased to hedge the interest crediting feature on the fixed-index universal life products. With the relatively large size of the fixed-index universal life block of business, the period-to-period changes in fair values of the underlying options have a significant effect on net investment income and universal life contract interest. A detail of net investment income for international life insurance operations is provided below.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,264 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss) </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,661) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance contract interest </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,087) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe gain or loss on index options follows the movement of the reference indice with realized gains or losses being recognized on the anniversary of each index option based upon the reference indice level at the expiration date relative to the index level at the time the index option was purchased. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded for index options outstanding based upon their fair values, largely determined by the reference indice level, at the balance sheet reporting date as compared to the original purchase cost of each respective option.\nLife and policy benefits primarily consist of death claims on policies. National Western's clientele for international products are generally wealthy individuals with access to U.S. dollars and quality medical care. Consequently, the amounts of coverage purchased historically tended to be larger amounts. Life and policy benefit expense for the international life segment reflects the larger policies historically purchased, however mortality due to natural causes is comparable to that in the United States. The Company's maximum risk exposure per insured life is capped at $500,000 through reinsurance. The average international life net claim amount (after reinsurance) in 2020 decreased to $158,200 from $175,000 while the number of claims incurred increased 14% from the amount incurred in 2019. Included in International Life death claims for 2020 were 18 with a cause of death identified as COVID-19 which aggregated to $2.7 million in net claims. Measured over a period of years, the Company's international life mortality experience has generally been better than pricing assumptions.\nThe Company records true-up adjustments to DPAC balances each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels, and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience as well as unlocking adjustments as necessary. The following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on international life insurance DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization components for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DPAC </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,860) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>251 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other amortization components </td> <td>24,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,107 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2020, the Company unlocked DPAC balances for lapse rates, mortality, and investment spread. While this unlocking had a relatively small impact on the International Life segment DPAC balance, a substantially larger effect was recorded in benefit reserves the change of which is reflected in contract interest expense as discussed below. During 2019, DPAC balances were unlocked for mortality rates, lapse rates, maintenance expenses, and investment spread which increased DPAC balances and reduced amortization expense. Favorable mortality experience on the block of business was the primary cause behind the DPAC balance increase and the amortization expense decrease.\nIn 2018, the Company unlocked DPAC balances associated with its International Life segment for extended death benefit reserves and the investment portfolio yield supporting universal life policy liabilities. The effect of the prospective unlocking was to decrease DPAC balances by $0.3 million (and increase amortization expense).\nAlthough not an unlocking, during 2018 the Company successfully converted its reserve modeling for excess death benefit reserves on UL riders over to its existing actuarial software platform. The implementation refined the actuarial estimate increasing these reserves and included an adjustment increasing the International Life DPAC balance (decreasing amortization expense). The amount of the core amortization expense decrease was $3.6 million.\nContract interest expense includes the fluctuations that are the result of the effect upon the embedded derivative for the performance of the underlying equity indices associated with fixed-indexed universal life products. For liability purposes, the embedded option in the Company's policyholder obligations for this feature is bifurcated and reserved for separately. Accordingly, the impact for the embedded derivative component in the equity-index universal life product is reflected in the contract interest expense for approximately the same amounts as the purchased call options are reported in net investment income for each respective period. Amounts realized on purchase call options generally approximate the amounts credited to policyholders.\nAs part of the mortality unlocking analysis done in 2020, the Company decreased its excess death benefit reserves by $22.8 million for favorable experience. The reduction in reserve is reported as an offset to contract interest expense. In 2019, the Company's excess benefit reserve was also unlocked resulting in an increase in the amount of $7.9 million which served to increase contract interest expense by a like amount. In 2018, the excess death benefit was unlocked producing a $14.1 million increase in the reserve and a similar increase in contract interest expense.\nAs noted in the Domestic Life segment discussion, operating expenses are allocated to lines of business based upon a functional cost analysis of the activity by business area giving rise to incurred expenses. A greater proportion of the Company's overall operating expenses have been allocated toward the Domestic Life and Annuity segments and away from the International Life segment due to the decreased activity relative to the former two segments.\nAnnuity Operations\nA comparative analysis of results of operations for the Company's annuity segment is detailed below.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums and other revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums and contract revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td>290,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>380,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>276,123 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total premiums and other revenues </td> <td>307,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>299,883 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefits and expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life and other policy benefits </td> <td>31,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,276 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs </td> <td>87,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,874 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity contract interest </td> <td>163,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,639 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses </td> <td>36,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,584 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total benefits and expenses </td> <td>318,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>333,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>235,373 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment earnings before Federal income taxes </td> <td>(10,957) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,510 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for Federal income taxes </td> <td>(1,649) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,139 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment earnings (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,308) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,371 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPremiums and contract charges primarily consist of surrender charge income recognized on terminated policies. The amount of the surrender charge income recognized is determined by the volume of surrendered contracts as well as the duration of each contract at the time of surrender given the pattern of declining surrender charge rates over time that is common to most annuity contracts. The Company's lapse rate for annuity contracts during 2020 was 8.1%, an increase from a rate of 7.4% in 2019 and the 7.5% rate experienced in 2018. The 2020 lapse rate is elevated as an outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in which consumers fortified their individual liquidity positions by accessing funds available from their policies. In addition, annuity contracts with fixed interest rates are more prone to terminate as contracts approach the end of their surrender charge period.\nDeposits collected on annuity contracts are not reflected as revenues in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings in accordance with GAAP. Actual annuity deposits collected are detailed below.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-index annuities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>330,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>241,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>382,153 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other deferred annuities </td> <td>7,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,883 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Immediate annuities </td> <td>20,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,172 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>358,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>264,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>411,208 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFixed-index products are more attractive for consumers when interest rate levels remain low and equity markets produce positive returns. Since National Western does not offer variable products or mutual funds, fixed-index products provide an important alternative to the Company's existing fixed interest rate annuity products. Fixed-index annuity deposits as a percentage of total annuity deposits were 92%, 91%, and 93% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The percentage of fixed-index products to total annuity sales reflects the low interest rate environment and the overall uptrend in the equities market.\nSome of the Company's deferred products, including fixed-index annuity products, contain a first year interest bonus in addition to the base first year interest rate. Other products include a premium bonus which is credited to the account balance when premiums are applied. These sales inducements are deferred in conjunction with other capitalized policy acquisition costs. The amount deferred to be amortized over future periods amounted to approximately $10.3 million, $3.2 million, and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization of deferred sales inducements is included as a component of annuity contract interest as described later in this discussion of Annuity Operations.\nA detail of net investment income for annuity operations is provided below.\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>283,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>307,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>327,922 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss) </td> <td>7,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(51,799) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>290,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>380,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>276,123 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity contract interest </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,639 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs seen in the above table, net investment income also includes the gains and losses on index options purchased to back the index crediting mechanism on fixed-index universal products. The gain or loss on index options follows the movement of the reference indice with realized gains and losses being recognized on the anniversary of each index option based upon the reference indice at the expiration date relative to the index level at the time the index option was purchased. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded for index options outstanding based upon their fair value, largely determined by the reference indice level, at the balance sheet reporting date as compared to the original purchase cost of each respective option.\nSince the embedded derivative option in the policies is bifurcated when determining the contract reserve liability, the impact of the market value change of index options on asset values generally aligns closely with the movement of the embedded derivative liability such that the net effect upon pretax earnings is negligible (i.e. net realized and unrealized gains/(losses) included in net investment income approximate the change in contract interest associated with the corresponding embedded derivative liability change). See further discussion below regarding contract interest activity.\nLife and other policy benefits for the Annuity segment in 2020 include the effects of the annual prospective unlocking exercise performed by the Company. The Company unlocked updating assumptions for the ultimate election rates associated with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) riders on its annuity contracts. The effect of the prospective unlocking was to reduce the GMWB reserve by $8.5 million which reduced Life and other policy benefits. The Company also unlocked for the mortality assumption associated with it payout annuity business. The effect of the prospective unlocking was to accelerate the deferred profit liability for this business by $3.3 million which also reduced Life and other policy benefits.\nAs part of the unlockings performed in 2019 and 2018, the Company also unlocked its policy benefits reserves associated with the assumption regarding policyholder utilization of the GMWB rider. The assumptions were updated for actual utilization experience versus that which was previously assumed. The effect of this prospective unlocking was to increase policy reserves by $0.7 million (and increase policy benefits expense) in 2019 and to decrease policy reserves by $15.7 million (and decrease life and policy benefits expense) in 2018. The adjustment in 2018 was the first instance of unlocking for utilization of the GMWB rider and the adjustment reflects an overly conservative utilization assumption that was previously in place.\nConsistent with the domestic and international life segments, the Company records true-up adjustments to DPAC balances each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience as well as unlocking adjustments as necessary. The following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on annuity DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization expense components for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DPAC </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,216) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other amortization components </td> <td>72,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,090 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,874 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2020, the Company unlocked Annuity segment DPAC balances for assumptions pertaining to lapse rates, annuitization rates, and portfolio investment yield rates supporting the block of business which increased amortization expense approximately $15.0 million. DPAC balances associated with the Annuity segment were unlocked in 2019 for assumptions pertaining to lapse rates, annuitization rates, investment spreads, and utilization of the Company's withdrawal benefit rider. The effect of the prospective unlocking was to increase amortization expense $2.6 million. In 2018, the Company unlocked the DPAC balances associated with its Annuity segment for assumptions concerning mortality, the election rate of the Company's withdrawal benefit rider, and for the investment portfolio yield supporting annuity contract accounts. The effect of the prospective unlocking was to decrease amortization expense by $2.2 million.\nAmortization of DPAC balances is proportional to estimated expected gross profits (\"EGPs\") for a line of business. The EGPs of the block of annuity policies that are not fixed-index have been steadily decreasing with the declining amount of policies in force, as well as DPAC unlocking in recent years for unfavorable experience. In addition, experience which deviates from the EGPs assumed can similarly increase or decrease the amortization of DPAC.\nAnnuity contract interest includes the equity component return associated with the call options purchased to hedge National Western's fixed-index annuities. The detail of fixed-index annuity contract interest as compared to contract interest for all other annuities is as follows:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-indexed annuities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other annuities </td> <td>85,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,028 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contract interest </td> <td>151,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,889 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bonus interest deferred and capitalized </td> <td>(10,344) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,160) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,546) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bonus interest amortization </td> <td>22,807 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,296 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contract interest </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,639 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fluctuation in reported contract interest amounts for fixed-index annuities is driven by sales levels, the level of the business in force, and the effect of positive or negative market returns of option values on projected interest credits. As noted in the net investment income discussion, the amounts shown for contract interest for fixed-index annuities generally align with the derivative gains/(losses) included in net investment income due to the market change of index options aligning closely with the movement of the embedded derivative liability held for these products.\nIn addition to the effects of the unlocking adjustments on Life and other policy benefits and amortization of DPAC expenses, the unlocking assumption changes impacted certain annuity benefit reserves. As noted above, the Company unlocked the mortality assumption with regards to payout annuities (contracts paying systematic benefits). The effect of the prospective unlocking was to increase annuity benefit reserves by $22.8 million which increased contract interest expense by a like amount. For other deferred fixed rate annuities, the unlocking assumption changes pertaining to lapse rates, annuitization rates and portfolio yields supporting the block of business increased annuitization and excess death benefit reserves by $11.3 million which similarly increased contract interest expense.\nAs noted in the discussion in the Consolidated Operations section, collection of asset management fees on positive returns of expiring options are subtracted from contract interest credited to policyholders. This offset serves to lessen the increase in contract interest expense relative to the option gains reported in the Company's net investment income. Asset management fees collected during 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $30.7 million, $15.9 million, and $24.3 million, respectively.\nAs previously noted, accounting rules require the embedded derivative liability to include a projection of asset management fees estimated to be collected in the succeeding fiscal year as an offset to projected policyholder interest credits. The projections are based upon the recent performance of options as of balance sheet reporting dates. The change in this projection, plus or minus, is included in contract interest expense for the period being reported on. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, contract interest was increased/(decreased) by $34.4 million, $(33.6) million, and $17.6 million, respectively, for this occurrence. The increases to contract interest expense reflect lower estimated asset management fees to be collected while the decrease to contract interest expense represents an increase to the amount of asset management fees estimated to be collected. The Annuity segment contains the products which charge asset management fees.\nAnnuity contract interest includes true-up adjustments for the deferred sales inducement balance which are done each period similar to that done with respect to DPAC balances with the adjustment reflected in current period contract interest expense. To the extent required, the Company may also record unlocking adjustments to deferred sales inducement balances in conjunction with DPAC balance unlockings. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 bonus interest amortization was increased/(decreased) by $4.4 million, $0.6 million, and $(1.3) million, respectively, for unlocking adjustments.\nAs noted in the Domestic Life insurance and International Life insurance segments, the Company's overall operating expenses are allocated based upon functional business activity and volumes.\nAcquired Businesses\nEffective January 31, 2019, Ozark National and NIS were acquired and their results included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. Ozark National and NIS have been combined into a separate segment \"Acquired Businesses\" given their inter-related marketing and sales approach which consists of a coordinated sale of a non-participating whole life insurance product (Ozark National) and a mutual fund investment product (NIS). An analysis of results of operations for the Company's acquired businesses segment is detailed below.

Brokerage revenues of $9.9 million for 2020 and $8.2 million for 2019 had associated brokerage expenses of $5.1 million in 2020 and $4.4 million in 2019 which is included in Other operating expenses. The 2019 figures are for the eleven months subsequent to its acquisition by the Company.\nThe average face value of Ozark National's policies in force at December 31, 2020 was approximately $33,700. Consequently, life and policy benefits for smaller face amounts are subject to variation from quarter to quarter. Incurred death claims in 2020 were $37.0 million representing an average net claim of $14,800 while for the eleven months of operations in 2019 incurred death claims were $29.3 million representing an average net claim of $15,300. Included in 2020 death claims were 191 claims with a cause of death identified as COVID-19 which aggregated to $2.8 million in net claims. Ozark National's maximum retention on any single insured life is $200,000 with limited exceptions related to the conversation of child protection and guaranteed insurability riders. The balance of life and policy benefits during 2020 and 2019 consists of increases in insurance reserves and payments of other policy benefits.\nAs part of the purchase accounting required with the acquisition of Ozark National effective January 31, 2019, the Company recorded an intangible asset of $145.8 million referred to as the value of business acquired (\"VOBA\"). VOBA represents the difference between the acquired assets and liabilities of Ozark National measured in accordance with the Company's accounting policies and the fair value of these same assets and liabilities. The VOBA balance sheet amount is amortized following a methodology similar to that used for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the cash value of certain acquired reserves was increased which resulted in a commensurate increase in both the traditional life reserve liability and the related VOBA balance reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSubsequent to its acquisition effective January 31, 2019, Ozark National began deferring policy acquisition costs and amortizing these deferrals similar to the methodology employed by National Western. The following table identifies the amortization expense of Ozark National's DPAC and VOBA for the eleven months subsequent to their acquisition.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>VOBA amortization expense </td> <td>10,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DPAC amortization expense </td> <td>552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Operations\nThe Company's primary business encompasses its domestic and international life insurance operations, its annuity operations, and its acquired businesses. However, the Company also has small real estate and other investment operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, and owned nursing home operations through the early part of 2019.\nAs discussed in the Consolidated Operations section, the Company closed on the sales of its two nursing home facilities during 2019. The Reno, Nevada nursing home operations were sold during the first quarter of 2019 and the San Marcos, Texas nursing home operations were in the second quarter of 2019. Operating results for each entity are included to the date of their respective sales. Nursing home operations generated $(0.7) million, $0.8 million and $1.3 million of pre-tax earnings in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The results for 2019 include net gains of $1.4 million from the sale of Reno personal property and equipment.\nPre-tax operating amounts include the results of BP III, the entity owning and operating the Company's home office facility in Austin, Texas. BP III commenced operations at the beginning of 2017 and National Western relocated to this facility in the fourth quarter of 2017 leasing approximately 40% of the facility. BP III incurred pre-tax losses of $(0.9) million, $(1.4) million and $(1.9) million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Lease and operating expense payments made by National Western to BP III have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe remaining pre-tax earnings in Other Operations of $22.6 million, $25.2 million, and $26.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, includes investment income from real estate, municipal bonds, and common and preferred equities held in subsidiary company portfolios principally for tax-advantage purposes. Included in these amounts are semi-annual distributions from a life interest in the Libbie Shearn Moody Trust which is held in NWLSM, Inc. Pretax distributions from this trust were $5.3 million, $6.7 million, and $7.5 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In addition, the Company holds a modest portfolio of equity securities, primarily in NWL Financial, Inc., whose fair value changes are recorded in net investment income. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the market value changes for these securities were $(1.0) million, $3.5 million, and $(2.4) million, respectively.\nPre-tax earnings in 2020 include other revenue of $4.1 million pertaining to the release of a contingent purchase price liability associated with the Ozark National acquisition which the buyer and seller mutually agreed had been satisfied. Pre-tax earnings in 2019 include expenses of $3.3 million related to the purchase of Ozark National and NIS which were not eligible for inclusion in the purchase price.\nINVESTMENTS\nGeneral\nThe Company's investment philosophy emphasizes the careful handling of policyowners' and stockholders' funds to achieve security of principal, to obtain the maximum possible yield while maintaining security of principal, and to maintain liquidity in a measure consistent with current and long-term requirements of the Company.\nThe Company's overall investment philosophy is reflected in the allocation of its investments, which is detailed below as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company has historically emphasized investment grade debt securities.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Carrying Value </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying Value </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,770,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,463,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans </td> <td>332,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>272,422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy loans </td> <td>74,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives, index options </td> <td>132,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate </td> <td>33,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities </td> <td>17,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>70,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,432,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,058,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvested assets at December 31, 2020 include Ozark National amounts as follows: Debt securities of $811.6 million; Policy loans of $25.5 million; and Real estate of $4.6 million. These amounts as of December 31, 2019 consisted of: Debt securities of $722.9 million; Policy loans of $27.1 million; and Real estate of $4.6 million.\nThe Company's investment portfolio increased 3% to $11.4 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $11.1 billion at December 31, 2019 reflecting adjustments made to record certain debt securities at fair value that were previously reported at amortized cost.\nEffective December 31, 2020, National Western entered into a Funds Withheld Coinsurance Agreement (\"Agreement\") with Prosperity Life Assurance Limited (\"Prosperity\") under which it ceded a 100% quota share of contractual statutory annuity reserve liabilities approximating $1.7 billion. Under terms of the Agreement, National Western, on behalf of Prosperity, transferred debt securities to a funds withheld account on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. These securities had previously been classified as held-to-maturity with an amortized cost value of $964.8 million and as available-for-sale at a fair market value of $712.5 million. Prosperity, as investment manager of the funds withheld account, intends to actively trade these securities in an effort to secure higher yields. Since Prosperity's intent is to not hold the funds withheld debt securities to maturity, the Company was required to reclassify the transferred holdings in the held-to-maturity category to the available-for-sale portfolio category for financial statement purposes. An unrealized gain of $67.1 million was recorded as a result of this transfer and resulted in all funds withheld debt securities recorded at fair market value as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company has historically designated approximately 70% of its debt securities in the held-to-maturity portfolio category, which is reported at amortized cost, with the remainder designated in the available-for-sale portfolio, which is reported at fair market value. As an outcome of the accounting for the securities involved in the Agreement with Prosperity, the Company's remaining held-to-maturity securities not included in the Agreement were also precluded from retaining the held-to-maturity classification. Accordingly, the Company reclassified debt securities with a $5.7 billion amortized cost to the available-for-sale category and recognized an unrealized gain of $523.8 million in reporting the securities at their fair market values. Consequently, the increase in the investment portfolio is primarily due to reporting balances at fair market value.\nDerivatives are call options purchased to hedge the interest crediting mechanism associated with the Company's fixed-index universal life and annuity policies. These options are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value in accordance with GAAP. The unrealized gain position of options held at December 31, 2020 was $71.0 million which was $9.7 million lower than the unrealized gain position at December 31, 2019 of $80.7 million. The decrease is due to the Company moving to an \"out-of-the-money\" option approach during 2020 which reduces the cost of options by not hedging for potential collection of asset management fees on the associated equity-indexed annuity contracts. The purchase cost of options outstanding at December 31, 2020 was $61.8 million and at December 31, 2019 was $76.9 million.\nThe growth in the Other investment category in 2020 is due to investments in alternative investment opportunities which have the potential for higher yields than that available with other investment securities. The typical structure involves a fund under the management of an investment management firm with direct lending expertise in a particular market niche which seeks to construct portfolios comprised of senior secured debt. The Company participates through capital funding commitments approved by its Board of Directors based upon the recommendation of the Company's senior investment management team. The funds have targeted dollar sizes and targeted internal rates of return.\nDebt Securities\nThe Company maintains a diversified debt securities portfolio which consists mostly of corporate, mortgage-backed, and public utility fixed income securities. Investments in mortgage-backed securities primarily include U.S. government agency pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMO\"). The Company's investment guidelines prescribe limitations by type of security as a percent of the total investment portfolio and all holdings were within these threshold limits. As of December 31, the Company's debt securities portfolio with available for sale and held to maturity classifications consisted of the following for 2020 and 2019:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Carrying Value </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying Value </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,098,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,668,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage-backed </td> <td>953,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,080,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public utilities </td> <td>909,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>959,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State and political subdivisions </td> <td>566,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>533,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. agencies </td> <td>75,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed securities </td> <td>120,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial mortgage-backed </td> <td>31,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign governments </td> <td>11,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasury </td> <td>3,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,770,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,463,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of the Company's investable cash flows are directed toward the purchase of long-term debt securities. The Company's investment policy calls for investing in debt securities that are investment grade, meet quality and yield objectives, and provide adequate liquidity for obligations to policyholders. Debt securities with intermediate maturities are targeted by the Company as they more closely match the intermediate nature of the Company's policy liabilities and provide an appropriate strategy for managing cash flows. In the past two years, the Company has purchased a higher level of longer maturity debt securities to match the increased duration of its growing life insurance policy liabilities. The Company holds minimal levels of U.S. Treasury securities due to their low yields and deposits most of these holdings with various state insurance departments in order to meet security deposit on hand requirements in these jurisdictions.\nLong-term debt securities purchased to fund National Western insurance company operations are summarized below.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of acquisitions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>727,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>299,442 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average S&P quality </td> <td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective annual yield </td> <td>3.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.06 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spread to treasuries </td> <td>2.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.79 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective duration </td> <td>12.2 years </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has deemphasized mortgage-backed securities for a number of years given the low interest rate environment and the lack of incremental yield relative to other classes of debt securities. Rating agencies generally view mortgage-backed securities as having additional risk for insurers holding interest sensitive liabilities given the potential for asset/liability disintermediation. Consequently, the Company holds predominantly agency mortgage-backed securities. Because mortgage-backed securities are subject to prepayment and extension risk, the Company has substantially reduced these risks by investing in collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMO\"), which have more predictable cash flow patterns than pass-through securities. These securities, known as planned amortization class I (\"PAC I\"), very accurately defined maturity (\"VADM\"), and sequential tranches, are designed to amortize in a more predictable manner than other CMO classes or pass-throughs. The Company does not purchase tranches, such as PAC II and support tranches, that subject the portfolio to greater than average prepayment risk. Using this strategy, the Company can more effectively manage and reduce prepayment and extension risks, thereby helping to maintain the appropriate matching of the Company's assets and liabilities.\nIn addition to diversification, an important aspect of the Company's investment approach is managing the credit quality of its investment in debt securities. Thorough credit analysis is performed on potential corporate investments including examination of a company's credit and industry outlook, financial ratios and trends, and event risks. This emphasis is reflected in the high average credit rating of the Company's debt securities portfolio with 97.2% held in investment grade securities as of December 31, 2020. In the table below, investments in debt securities available for sale and held to maturity are classified according to credit ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Carrying Value </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying Value </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AAA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA </td> <td>1,818,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,112,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A </td> <td>3,188,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,347,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB </td> <td>5,344,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,806,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BB and other below investment grade </td> <td>303,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,770,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,463,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough the Company's investment guidelines, as well as state insurance law, allow for the purchase of below investment grade securities, it has been the Company's practice to only purchase debt securities which are investment grade at the time of acquisition. Investments in debt securities that are below investment grade are the result of subsequent downgrades of the securities.

As a result of the investment downgrades which occurred in 2020 due to the economic stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, additional analyses were performed of the individual credits whose market values were most significantly impacted. While additional losses are not currently anticipated, based on the existing status and condition of these securities, continued credit deterioration of some securities or the markets in general is possible, which may result in future allowances or write-downs.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles through the end of 2019 required that investments in debt securities be written down to fair value when declines in value were judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price methodology). Refer to Note (4), Fair Values of Financial Instruments, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nDuring 2019, the Company recorded a $7.8 million other-than-temporary impairment on a single debt security issuer. Under prior GAAP guidance pertaining to the recognition and accounting for other-than-temporary impairments and their classification as either a credit loss or non-credit loss, the Company recognized a cumulative total of $8.5 million of other-than-temporary impairments of which $8.5 million was deemed credit related and recognized as realized investment losses in earnings, and $0.0 million, net of amortization, which was deemed non-credit related and recognized in other comprehensive income.\nAs disclosed in Note (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, the Company adopted new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2020 for credit loss recognition of certain financial assets, including debt securities classified in the \"held-to-maturity\" category. The Company employed a cohort cumulative loss rate method in estimating current expected credit losses with respect to its held-to-maturity debt securities as of January 1, 2020 and derived an initial allowance of $3.3 million. This method applied publicly available industry wide statistics of default incidence by defined segmentations of debt security investments combined with future assumptions regarding economic conditions (i.e. GDP forecasts) both in the near term and the long term. As described above, at December 31, 2020, the Company was required to reclassify all of its held-to-maturity debts securities to the available-for-sale category eliminating the allowance previously recorded. The following table presents the allowance for credit losses activity for the period shown.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Securities Allowance for Credit Losses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of the period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of adopting new accounting guidance </td> <td> </td> <td>3,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Releases)/provision during the period </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,334) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company is required to classify its investments in debt securities into one of three categories: (a) trading securities; (b) securities available-for-sale; or (c) securities held-to-maturity. The Company's investment philosophy calls for purchases of securities with the intent to hold to maturity. Historically, a determination was made on categorization based on various factors including the type and quality of the particular security and how it will be incorporated into the Company's overall asset/liability management strategy. As shown in the table below, at December 31, 2020, 100.0% of the Company's total debt securities were classified as securities available-for-sale, including the debt securities in the funds withheld account. These holdings in available-for-sale provide flexibility to the Company to react to market opportunities and conditions and to practice active management within the portfolio to provide adequate liquidity to meet policyholder obligations and other cash needs.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Allowance For Credit Loss </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Unrealized Gains </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Held-to-maturity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available-for-sale </td> <td>10,770,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,874,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>896,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,770,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,874,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>896,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs noted previously, the Company transferred approximately $1.7 billion of its debt securities into the available-for-sale category effective December 31, 2020 as a result of a reinsurance agreement with Prosperity that resulted in an unrealized investment gain of $67.1 million.\nMortgage Loans and Real Estate\nThe Company originates loans on high quality, income-producing properties such as shopping centers, freestanding retail stores, office buildings, industrial and sales or service facilities, selected apartment buildings, hotels, and health care facilities. The location of these properties is typically in major metropolitan areas that offer a potential for property value appreciation. Credit and default risk is minimized through strict underwriting guidelines and diversification of underlying property types and geographic locations. In addition to being secured by the property, mortgage loans with leases on the underlying property are often guaranteed by the lease payments. This approach has proved over time to result in quality mortgage loans with few defaults. Mortgage loan interest income is recognized on an accrual basis with any premium or discount amortized over the life of the loan. Prepayment and late fees are recorded on the date of collection.\nThe Company targets a minimum specified yield on mortgage loan investments determined by reference to currently available debt security instrument yields, plus a desired amount of incremental basis points. During the past several years, the low interest rate environment, along with a competitive marketplace, resulted in fewer loan opportunities being available that met the Company's required rate of return. During 2020, mortgage loan originations were further impeded by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects upon the commercial real estate market. Mortgage loans originated by the Company totaled $80.2 million and $121.4 million for the years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Principal repayments on mortgage loans in 2020 and 2019 were $14.8 million and $47.8 million, respectively.\nLoans in foreclosure, loans considered impaired or loans past due 90 days or more are placed on a non-accrual status. If a mortgage loan is determined to be on non-accrual status, the mortgage loan does not accrue any revenue into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The loan is independently monitored and evaluated as to potential impairment or foreclosure. If delinquent payments are made and the loan is brought current, then the Company returns the loan to active status and accrues income accordingly. The Company currently has no loans past due 90 days which are accruing interest. As a result of the economic climate change induced by the COVID-19 virus, various mortgage loan borrowers of the Company requested a temporary forbearance of principal payments on loans in the range of three to nine months. During 2020, there were eight loans representing an aggregate principal balance of $29.2 million with borrowers meeting specified criteria of the Company that forbearance terms were agreed to. At December 31, 2020, only one of these loans with a principal balance of $4.7 million remained in forbearance.\nThe Company held net investments in mortgage loans, after allowances for possible losses, totaling $332.5 million and $272.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The diversification of the portfolio by geographic region, property type, and loan-to-value ratio was as follows:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Appraisals are required at the time of funding and may be updated if a material change occurs from the original loan agreement.\nAll mortgage loans are analyzed quarterly in order to monitor the financial quality of these assets. Based on ongoing monitoring, mortgage loans with a likelihood of becoming delinquent are identified and placed on an internal watch list\u201d. Among the criteria that would indicate a potential problem are: major tenant vacancies or bankruptcies, late payments, and loan relief/restructuring requests. The mortgage loan portfolio is analyzed for the need for a valuation allowance on any loan that is on the internal watch list, in the process of foreclosure, or that currently has a valuation allowance.\nPrior to January 1, 2020, mortgage loans were considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it was probable that the Company would be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When it was determined that a loan was impaired, a loss was recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value reduced by the cost to sell. Estimated value was typically based on the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. Impairments and changes in the valuation allowance were reported in net realized investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company held a valuation allowance of $0.7 million at December 31, 2019.\nAs disclosed in Note (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, the Company adopted new accounting guidance for credit loss recognition criteria for certain financial assets, including mortgage loans. For mortgage loan investments the Company employed the Weighted Average Remaining Maturity (\"WARM\") method in estimating current expected losses with respect to mortgage loan investments as of January 1, 2020 and each succeeding calendar quarter-end during 2020. The WARM method applies publicly available data of default incidence of commercial real estate properties by several defined segmentations combined with future assumptions regarding economic conditions (i.e. GDP forecasts) both in the near term and the long term. Under this new accounting guidance, at January 1, 2020 a balance of $1.2 million was recorded which incorporated the previous year-end balance under the prior accounting method. The adjustment resulted in a charge to retained earnings as a change in accounting, net of tax, of $0.4 million. Subsequent changes in the allowance for current expected credit losses are reported in net investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe following table represents the mortgage loan allowance for credit losses.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Loans Allowance for Credit Losses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of the period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>675 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of adoption of new accounting guidance </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision during the period </td> <td>1,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Releases </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>675 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company had no mortgage loans past due six months or more at December 31, 2020 or 2019.

Included in the amounts at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is a surface parking property owned by Ozark National which it contracts out for rent. The value of this real estate investment was appraised at $4.3 million at January 31, 2019 as part of the purchase accounting done as of that date. The Company recognized operating income on these properties of approximately $2.9 million, $2.9 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company monitors the conditions and market values of these properties on a regular basis and makes repairs and capital improvements to keep the properties in good condition. The Company recorded net realized investment gains of $2.7 million, $6.9 million and $1.8 million associated with real estate investments in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net realized investment gains for the year ended December 31, 2020 pertain to property located in Travis County, Texas which was sold. Included in net realized investment gains during 2019 are the sale of the Company's former home office facility in Austin, Texas at a gain of $3.2 million and the sale of the Company's two nursing home facilities at a net gain of $3.7 million.\nDerivatives, Index Options\nThe Company offers fixed-index universal life and annuity products that guarantee the return of principal to policyholders and, at the policyholder's election, credit interest based on a percentage gain in a specified equity market index (policyholders may alternatively elect a fixed interest rate). Premiums and deposits received on these products are predominantly invested in investment grade fixed income securities with a portion used to purchase derivatives consisting of call options on the applicable market index to fund the index credits due to fixed-index policyholders. The call options purchased are one year over-the-counter option contracts coinciding with the initial issuance of the policy and subsequent annual renewal periods in order to match the Company's funding requirements for the underlying policies. On the respective anniversary dates of the index policies, the index used to compute the annual index credit is reset and a new one-year call option is purchased to fund the next annual index credit.\nAlthough the call options are employed to be effective hedges against the Company's policyholder obligations from an economic standpoint, they do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP. Accordingly, the call options are marked to fair value on each reporting date with the change in fair value, plus or minus, included as a component of net investment income. The change in fair value of the call options includes the realized gains or losses recognized at the expiration of the option term and the unrealized gain or loss changes in fair value for open contracts.\nThe Company's design of its fixed-index products incorporates a budget for the purchase of over-the-counter call options to fund the index credits due to policyholders. Management monitors current prices of these call options and manages component features of the fixed-index products in accordance with the terms of the policy contracts in order to control the cost of purchases. These terms permit the Company to change caps, participation rates, and asset fees, subject to guaranteed minimums, thus managing the cost of the call options quoted by counterparties. In addition, the Company's product terms allow for the Company to withdraw from offering a particular index option at any time effective on the next policy anniversary date.\nThe fair value of derivative instruments presented in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements totaling $132.8 million at December 31, 2020 and $157.6 million at December 31, 2019 pertain to notional policyholder account values of $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, electing interest credits based upon applicable market index performance.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of change in market values of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices. The most significant market risk exposure for the Company is interest rate risk. Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the profitability of insurance products and the fair value of investments. The yield realized on new investments generally increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes. The fair values of fixed income debt securities correlate to external market interest rate conditions as market values typically increase when market interest rates decline and decrease when market interest rates rise. However, market values may fluctuate for other reasons, such as changing economic conditions, market dislocations or increasing event-risk concerns.\nInterest Rate Risk\nA gradual increase in interest rates from current levels would generally be a positive development for the Company. Rate increases would be expected to provide incremental net investment income, produce increased sales of fixed rate products, and limit the potential erosion of the Company's interest rate spread on products due to minimum guaranteed crediting rates in products. Alternatively, a rise in interest rates would reduce the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio and if long-term rates rise dramatically within a relatively short time period the Company could be exposed to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk is the risk that policyholders will surrender their policies in a rising interest rate environment forcing the Company to liquidate assets when they are in an unrealized loss position.\nA decline in interest rates could cause certain mortgage-backed securities in the Company's portfolio to be more likely to pay down or prepay. In this situation, the Company typically will be unable to reinvest the proceeds at comparable yields. Lower interest rates will likely also cause lower net investment income, subject the Company to reinvestment rates risks, and possibly reduce profitability through reduced interest rate margins associated with products having minimum guaranteed crediting rates. Alternatively, the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio will increase when interest rates decline.\nThe correlation between fair values and interest rates for debt securities is reflected in the tables below.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities - fair value </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,770,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,764,648 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities - amortized cost </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,874,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,312,365 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value as a percentage of amortized cost </td> <td>109.08 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>104.39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses) at year-end </td> <td>$ </td> <td>896,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>452,283 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ten-year U.S. Treasury bond - increase (decrease) in yield for the year </td> <td>(1.00) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.77) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's unrealized gain balance for debt securities held at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is shown in the following table.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Unrealized Gain Balance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Balance at </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Balance at </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change in Net </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities held-to-maturity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>301,458 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(301,458) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities available-for-sale </td> <td>896,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150,825 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>745,555 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>896,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>452,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>444,097 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in interest rates typically have a sizable effect on the fair values of the Company's debt securities. During 2020, the market interest rate of the ten-year U.S. Treasury bond decreased roughly 100 basis points from 1.92% at year-end 2019 to 0.92% at year-end 2020. Therefore, the dollar increase in the unrealized gain position was primarily the result of the decrease in interest rate levels.\nThe Company manages interest rate risk principally through ongoing cash flow testing as required for insurance regulatory purposes. Computer models are used to perform cash flow testing under various commonly used stress test interest rate scenarios to determine if existing assets would be sufficient to meet projected liability outflows. Sensitivity analysis allows the Company to measure the potential gain or loss in fair value of its interest-sensitive instruments and to protect its economic value and achieve a predictable spread between what is earned on invested assets and what is paid on liabilities. The Company seeks to minimize the impact of interest risk through surrender charges that are imposed to discourage policy surrenders. Interest rate changes can be anticipated in computer models and the corresponding risk addressed by management actions affecting asset and liability instruments. However, potential changes in the values of financial instruments indicated by hypothetical interest rate changes will likely be different from actual changes experienced, and the differences could be significant.\nThe Company has the ability to adjust interest rates, participation rates, and asset management fees and caps, as applicable, in response to changes in investment portfolio yields for a substantial portion of its business in force. The ability to adjust these rates is subject to competitive forces in the market for the Company's products. Surrender rates could increase and new sales could be negatively affected if crediting rates are not competitive with the rates on competing products offered by other insurance companies and financial service entities. The Company designs its interest sensitive and annuity products with features encouraging persistency, such as surrender and withdrawal penalty provisions. Typically, surrender charge rates gradually decrease each year the contract is in force.\nThe Company seeks to minimize the impact of interest rate risk through surrender charges that are imposed to discourage policy surrenders and to offset unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs. Certain products, such as supplementary contracts with life contingencies, are not subject to surrender or discretionary withdrawal. The Company may also include a market value adjustment ( MVA\u201d) feature on its annuity products which could increase or decrease the amount paid to contract holders upon surrender of their contract as a means to further mitigate interest rate risk.\nThe following table profiles the Company's insurance liabilities at December 31, 2020 for annuities, deposit-type contracts and supplementary contracts with life contingencies by surrender and discretionary withdrawal characteristics.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subject to discretionary withdrawal: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>With market value adjustment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>290,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>With surrender charge of 5% or more </td> <td>4,644,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>With surrender charge of 5% or less </td> <td>1,564,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not subject to discretionary withdrawal </td> <td>369,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Gross </td> <td>6,869,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance ceded </td> <td>1,707,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,162,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nThe following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of the Company's interest rate sensitive assets.

Actual results could vary materially from those illustrated due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. Expected maturities of debt securities may differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions. The models assume that prepayments on mortgage-backed securities are influenced by agency and pool types, the level of interest rates, loan age, refinancing incentive, month of the year, and underlying coupon. During periods of declining interest rates, principal payments on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations tend to increase as the underlying mortgages are prepaid. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the rate of prepayment slows. Both of these situations can expose the Company to the possibility of asset-liability cash flow and yield mismatch. The model uses a proprietary method of sampling interest rate paths along with a mortgage prepayment model to derive future cash flows. The initial interest rates used are based on the current U.S. Treasury yield curve as well as current mortgage rates for the various types of collateral in the portfolio.\nMortgage and other loans were modeled by discounting scheduled cash flows through the scheduled maturities of the loans, starting with interest rates currently being offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings. Policy loans were modeled by discounting estimated cash flows using U.S. Treasury Bill interest rates as base rates at December 31, 2020. The estimated cash flows include assumptions as to whether such loans will be repaid by the policyholders or settled upon payment of death or surrender benefits on the underlying insurance contracts and incorporate both Company experience and mortality assumptions associated with such contracts.\nIn addition to the securities analyzed above, the Company invests in index options which are derivative financial instruments used to hedge the equity return component of the Company's indexed annuity and life products. The values of these options are primarily impacted by equity price risk, as the options' fair values are dependent on the performance of the underlying reference index. However, increases or decreases in investment returns from these options are substantially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in amounts paid to indexed policyholders, subject to minimum guaranteed policy interest rates.\nThe Company's market risk liabilities, which include policy liabilities for annuity and supplemental contracts, are managed for interest rate risk through cash flow testing as previously described. As part of this cash flow testing, the Company has analyzed the potential impact on net earnings of a 100 basis point decrease and increases in increments of 100 basis points in the U.S. Treasury yield curve as of December 31, 2020. The potential impact on net earnings from these interest rate changes are summarized below.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Changes in Interest Rates in Basis Points </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>-100 </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on net earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(674) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,065 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese estimated impacts on earnings are net of tax effects and the estimated effects of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nThe above described scenarios produce estimated changes in cash flows as well as cash flow reinvestment projections. Estimated cash flows in the Company's model assume cash flow reinvestments, which are representative of the Company's current investment strategy. Calls and prepayments include scheduled maturities and those expected to occur which would benefit the security issuers. Assumed policy surrenders consider differences and relationships between credited interest rates and market interest rates as well as surrender charges on individual policies. The impact to earnings also includes the expected effects on amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. The model considers only annuity and supplemental contracts in force at December 31, 2020, and does not consider new product sales or the possible impact of interest rate changes on sales.\nCredit Risk\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk through counterparties and within its investment portfolio. Credit risk relates to the uncertainty associated with an obligor's continued ability to make timely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of an instrument or contract. As previously discussed, the Company manages credit risk through established investment credit policies and guidelines which address the quality of creditors and counterparties, concentration limits, diversification practices and acceptable risk levels. These policies and guidelines are regularly reviewed and approved by senior management and the Company's Board of Directors.\nIn connection with the Company's use of call options to hedge the equity return component of its fixed-indexed annuity and life products, the Company is exposed to the risk that a counterparty fails to perform under terms of the option contract. The Company purchases one-year option contracts from multiple counterparties and evaluates the creditworthiness of all counterparties prior to the purchase of the contracts. For consideration in contracting with a counterparty the rating required by the Company is a credit rating of A\u201d or higher. Accordingly, all options are purchased from nationally recognized financial institutions with a demonstrated performance for honoring their financial obligations and possessing substantial financial capacity. In addition, each counterparty is required to execute a credit support agreement obligating the counterparty to provide collateral to the Company when the fair value of the Company's exposure to the counterparty exceeds specified amounts. Counterparty credit ratings and credit exposure are monitored continuously by National Western's Investment department with adjustments to collateral levels managed as incurred under the credit support agreements.\nThe Company's net exposure to loss due to credit risk if option counterparties failed to completely perform according to the terms of their one-year contracts is as follows at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

loss on index options due to counterparty default.\nThe Company is also exposed to credit spread risk related to market prices of investment securities and cash flows associated with changes in credit spreads. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed debt securities but will also increase the fair value of the investment portfolio. Credit spread widening will reduce the fair value of the investment portfolio but will also increase net investment income on new purchases.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nLiquidity requirements are met primarily by funds provided from operations. Premium deposits and annuity considerations, investment income, and investment maturities and prepayments are the primary sources of funds while investment purchases, policy benefits in the form of claims, and payments to policyholders and contract holders in connection with surrenders and withdrawals as well as operating expenses are the primary uses of funds. To ensure the Company will be able to pay future commitments, the funds received as premium payments and deposits are invested in high quality investments, primarily fixed income securities. Funds are invested with the intent that the income from investments, plus proceeds from maturities, will meet the ongoing cash flow needs of the Company. The approach of matching asset and liability durations and yields requires an appropriate mix of investments. Although the Company historically has not been put in the position of having to liquidate invested assets to provide cash flow, its investments consist primarily of marketable debt securities that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs. National Western maintains a line of credit facility of $75 million which it may access for short-term cash needs. As part of the acquisition of Ozark National and NIS effective January 31, 2019, National Western borrowed $75 million to partly fund the closing cash purchase price of $205.4 million. The amounts borrowed were subsequently repaid during the first quarter of 2019 and there have been no borrowings under the line of credit since that time including as at December 31, 2020.\nA primary liquidity concern for life insurers is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals, particularly with respect to annuity products which can move more rapidly with interest rate changes. The Company includes provisions within its annuity and universal life insurance policies, such as surrender and market value adjustments, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals.\nThe following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of National Western's annuity reserves and deposit liabilities (based on statutory reporting liability values) as of the dates indicated.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>369,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>382,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subject to discretionary withdrawal, with adjustment: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>With market value adjustment </td> <td>290,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>483,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At contract value less current surrender charge of 5% or more </td> <td>4,644,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4,880,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal </td> <td>5,305,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5,745,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than 5% </td> <td>1,564,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,386,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities - Gross </td> <td>6,869,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7,131,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance ceded </td> <td>1,707,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities - Net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,162,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,131,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe actual amounts paid out by product line in connection with surrenders and withdrawals are noted in the table below.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product Line: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional Life </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,755 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal Life </td> <td>96,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,819 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuities </td> <td>643,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>705,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>709,810 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>756,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>824,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>812,384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above contractual withdrawals, as well as the level of surrenders experienced, and the associated cash outflows did not have an adverse impact on overall liquidity. The amount shown for traditional life in 2020 and 2019 includes Ozark National cash outflows (subsequent to their acquisition on January 31, 2019). Individual life insurance policies are typically less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may need to undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy elsewhere. Annuity dollar outflows are generally more sensitive to economic conditions, interest rate levels, and the level of surrender charges assessed upon withdrawal or termination. Cash flow projections and tests under various market interest rate scenarios and assumptions are performed to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy. With economic decline precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Company management conducted additional liquidity scenario testing during 2020 using more severe assumptions and concluded that liquid assets were more than adequate under these scenarios. Accordingly, the Company currently expects available liquidity sources and future cash flows to be more than adequate to meet the demand for funds.\nCash flows from the Company's insurance operations have historically been sufficient to meet current needs. Cash flows from operating activities were $373.1 million, $329.0 million, and $326.6 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Company also has significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled investment security maturities, redemptions, and prepayments. These cash flows totaled $1,294.8 million, $995.8 million, and $633.2 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Operating and investing activity cash flow items could be reduced if interest rates rise at an accelerated rate in the future. Net cash inflows/(outflows) from the Company's universal life and annuity product operations totaled $(437.4) million, $(584.7) million, and $(440.6) million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, reflecting lower levels of annuity sales in combination with a higher incidence of annuity cash surrenders and withdrawals.\nCapital Resources\nThe Company relies on stockholders for its capital resources as there is no long-term debt outstanding and the Company does not anticipate the need for any long-term debt in the near future. As of December 31, 2020, the Company maintained commitments for its normal operating and investment activities. During the first quarter of 2020, National Western became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (FHLB) through an initial minimum required stock investment of $4.3 million. Through this membership, National Western will have a specified borrowing capacity based upon the amount of collateral it establishes.\nThe Company has declared and paid an annual dividend on its common shares since 2005. The Company's practice has been to take a conservative approach to dividends, and the Board of Directors has adopted a strategic position to substantially reinvest earnings internally. This conservative approach yields the following benefits: (1) providing capital to finance the development of new business; (2) enabling the Company to take advantage of potential acquisitions and other competitive situations as they arise; (3) building a strong capital base to support the Company's financial strength ratings; (4) maintaining the Company's liquidity and solvency during difficult economic and market conditions; and (5) enhancing the Company's regulatory capital position. For similar reasons, despite the fact the Company's market price of its Class A common shares has been trading at a discount to the book value per share for some time, there are no imminent plans for the Company to repurchase its shares\nAs the largest subsidiary of NWLGI, National Western serves as the primary funding source for NWLGI. The capacity of National Western to pay dividends to NWLGI is limited by law in the state of Colorado to earned profits (statutory unassigned surplus). At December 31, 2020, the maximum amount legally available for distribution during 2021 without further regulatory approval is $45.5 million.\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") has established risk-based capital (\"RBC\") standards for U.S. life insurers as well as a risk-based capital model act (\"RBC Model Act\"). The RBC Model Act requires that life insurers annually submit a report to state regulators regarding their RBC amounts based upon four categories of risk (asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, and business risk). The capital requirement for each is determined by applying factors that vary based upon the degree of risk to various asset, premium and policy benefit reserve items. The formula is an early warning tool to identify potential weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action. Independent rating agencies utilize proprietary versions similar to the NAIC RBC model incorporating additional risk factors identified in their respective rating methodology. At December 31, 2020, National Western and Ozark National each maintained statutory capital substantially in excess of applicable statutory requirements.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nIt is Company practice to not enter into off-balance sheet arrangements or to issue guarantees to third parties, other than in the normal course of issuing insurance contracts. Commitments related to insurance products sold are reflected as liabilities for future policy benefits. Insurance contracts guarantee certain performances by National Western and Ozark National.\nInsurance reserves are the means by which life insurance companies determine the liabilities that must be established to assure that future policy benefits are provided for and can be paid. These reserves are required by law and based upon standard actuarial methodologies to ensure fulfillment of commitments guaranteed to policyholders and their beneficiaries, even though the obligations may not be due for many years. Refer to Note (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for a discussion of reserving methods.\nThe table below summarizes future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payment Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than 5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan commitments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments for capital calls to investment funds </td> <td>150,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,092 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Claims payable (2)\n</td> <td>77,687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term reserve liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under GAAP (3)\n</td> <td>12,834,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,034,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,905,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,700,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,194,986 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,082,038 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,175,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,996,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,700,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,210,078 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Refer to Note (17) Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report relating to Company leases.\n(2) Claims payable include benefit and claim liabilities for life, accident and health policies which the Company believes the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable. Such amounts generally relate to incurred and reported death, critical illness, accident and health claims including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported.\n(3) Other long-term liabilities include estimated life and annuity obligations related to death claims, policy surrenders, policy withdrawals, maturities and annuity payments based on mortality, lapse, annuitization, and withdrawal assumptions consistent with the Company's historical experience. These estimated life and annuity obligations are undiscounted projected cash outflows that assume interest crediting and market growth consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs. They do not include any offsets for future premiums or deposits. Other long-term liabilities also include determinable payout patterns related to immediate annuities. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the actual cash outflows will differ both in amount and timing, possibly materially, from these estimates.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING\nChanges in Accounting Principles\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company implemented ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. This standard replaced the previous incurred loss recognition model with an expected loss recognition model for certain financial assets. Adoption of the standard resulted in an incremental allowance for credit losses as of January 1, 2020 of $3.8 million, and a charge to retained earnings, net of tax, of $3.0 million as a change in accounting. There were no other changes in accounting principles during the periods reported in this Form 10-K.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nCorrection of Errors\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, management identified an understatement of an excess benefit reserve on a specific block of policies that dated back to the first quarter of 2004 with the adoption of Statement of Position 03-1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts (SOP 03-1). Management concluded that this error was not material to previously issued consolidated financial statements and would be corrected through a revision to the comparative consolidated balance sheet presented for the year ended December 31, 2019. The impact of this revision as of December 31, 2019 was an increase to the future policy benefits liability of $15.0 million, a decrease to the deferred federal income tax liability of $3.2 million, and a decrease to retained earnings of $11.8 million.", "summary": "- The company recorded derivative gains/losses and contract interest amounts as follows:\n- Unrealized gain/loss:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor\u201d for forward-looking statements. Certain information contained herein or in other written or oral statements made by or on behalf of National Western Life Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") are or may be viewed as forward-looking. Although the Company has taken appropriate care in developing any such information, forward-looking information involves risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact actual results. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, matters described in the Company's filings such as exposure to market risks, anticipated cash flows or operating performance, future capital needs, and statutory or regulatory related issues. However, as a matter of policy, the Company does not make any specific projections as to future earnings, nor does it endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by others. Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments. Also, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) of National Western Life Group, Inc. (\"NWLGI\") for the three years ended December 31, 2020 follows. Where appropriate, discussion specific to the insurance operations of National Western Life Insurance Company is denoted by \"National Western\" or \"NWLIC\". This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page 96 of this report.\nEffective January 31, 2019, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Ozark National Life Insurance Company (\"Ozark National\") and N.I.S. Financial Services, Inc. (\"NIS\") following the receipt of regulatory approvals. NWLGI and National Western paid cash in an aggregate amount of approximately $205.4 million in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of Ozark National (wholly owned by National Western) and NIS (wholly owned by NWLGI). The eleven month results of Ozark National and NIS are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and reference to each is made in this MD&A where appropriate.\nOverview\nNational Western has historically provided life insurance products on a global basis for the savings and protection needs of policyholders and issued annuity contracts for the asset accumulation and retirement needs of contract holders, both domestic and international residents. As disclosed in the Company's 2018 filings, the Company discontinued accepting applications for its international life insurance products from all foreign residents in other countries in the second quarter of 2018.\nThe Company, National Western and Ozark National, accepts funds from policyholders or contract holders and establishes a liability representing future obligations to pay the policy or contract holders and their beneficiaries. To ensure the Company will be able to pay these future commitments, the funds received as premium payments and deposits are invested in high quality investments, primarily fixed income securities.\nDue to the business of accepting funds to pay future obligations in later years and the underlying economics, the relevant factors affecting the Company's overall business and profitability include the following:\n\nThe Company monitors these factors continually as key business indicators. The discussion that follows in this Item 7 includes these indicators and presents information useful to an overall understanding of the Company's business performance in 2020, incorporating required disclosures in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nImpact of Recent Business Environment\nThe Company's business is generally aided by an economic environment experiencing growth, whether moderate or vibrant, characterized by improving employment data and increases in personal income. Important metrics indicating sustained economic growth over the longer term principally revolve around employment and confidence, both consumer and business sentiment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic not only affected how businesses conducted operations but also introduced a great deal of uncertainty to the life insurance industry. A relevant consideration for the industry was how might the morbidity exposure of COVID-19 translate into a higher death claim incidence. The Company (National Western and Ozark National) incurred approximately $8.0 million in net death claims for which COVID-19 was identified as the cause of death which did not result in total death claims significantly higher than historical experience. The more significant consequence of the pandemic was the impact on asset valuations. Invested assets declined in value due to downgrades in credit market securities resulting in impairment-related losses or sizable additions being made to the allowance for current credit losses in financial statements. Consequently, there has been balance sheet asset deterioration, charges to capital, and lower reported earnings.\nIn recent years, in an attempt to acquire additional investment yield in the low rate environment, life insurers substantially increased allocations to BBB- rated bonds. In a recession, many of these investment grade corporate credits are at risk for downgrades, as well as the potential to default. Risk-based capital (RBC) formulas assess higher required capital charges as investment quality declines. A meaningful shift of BBB- rated debt securities to non-investment grade categories could have significant implications in terms of required capital levels which would depress RBC ratios of impacted insurers. Life insurance companies also have a large exposure to real estate in its investment portfolios through commercial mortgage, direct real estate investment, alternative investment funds, and mortgage-backed securities. These investments are highly dependent upon occupancy and payment of rent and lease obligations. The quarantine and shelter-at-home lockdown affect the ability to meet these payment obligations.\nLife insurance revenues are driven more by renewal premiums than sales. Most state insurance departments have issued directives instructing insurers to allow premium payments to fall into arrears. New life insurance sales face the challenge of having to forego face-to-face consultation with agents and distributors. In addition, full medical underwriting, which is a cornerstone of evaluating risk when an insurer makes the decision to offer coverage and at what level of coverage, will likely be unavailable or difficult to complete as a medical test for life insurance applications will not be considered as \"essential\" in a pandemic environment.\nWith regard to the credit market, although not probable in the current environment, industry analysts and observers generally agree that a sudden jump in interest rate levels would be harmful to life insurers with interest-sensitive products as it could provide an impetus for abnormal levels of product surrenders and withdrawals at the same time fixed debt securities held by insurers declined in market value. Ultimately, a mix of monetary policy adjustments, fiscal policy, and economic fundamentals will determine the future direction of interest rate movements and the speed of such shifts. It is uncertain at what pace interest rate movements may occur in the future and what impact, if any, such movements would have on the Company's business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn an environment such as this, the need for a strong capital position that can cushion against unexpected bumps is critical for stability and ongoing business activity. The Company's operating strategy continues to be focused on maintaining capital levels substantially above regulatory and rating agency requirements. Our business model is predicated upon steady growth in invested assets while managing the block of business within profitability objectives. A key premise of our financial management is maintaining a high quality investment portfolio, well matched in terms of duration with policyholder obligations, that continues to outperform the industry with respect to adverse impairment experience. This discipline enables the Company to sustain resources more than adequate to fund future growth and absorb abnormal periods of cash outflows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAccounting policies discussed below are those considered critical to an understanding of the Company's financial statements.\nImpairment of Investment Securities. The Company's accounting policy requires that a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost basis be evaluated to determine if the decline is a result of credit loss. The primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for fixed income and equity securities without readily determinable fair values is a result of credit loss are: (a) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (b) the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, interest rate related, credit spread widening), (c) the overall financial condition as well as the near-term prospects of the issuer, (d) whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated principal and interest payments, and (e) that the Company does not intend or be required to sell the investment prior to recovery. In addition, certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows are evaluated periodically by the Company to update the estimated cash flows over the life of the security. If the Company determines that the fair value of the securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the previous purchase or prior impairment, then a credit loss charge is recognized. The Company would recognize impairment of securities due to changing interest rates or market dislocations only if the Company intended to sell the securities prior to recovery. When a security is deemed to be impaired, a charge is recorded equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security. In compliance with GAAP guidance the estimated credit loss is recorded as an allowance with changes in the allowance recorded to Net investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs ( DPAC\u201d). The Company is required to defer certain policy acquisition costs and amortize them over future periods. These costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are directly associated with acquiring new business. The deferred costs are recorded as an asset commonly referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs. The DPAC asset balance is subsequently charged to income over the lives of the underlying contracts in relation to the anticipated emergence of revenue or profits. Actual revenue or profits can vary from Company estimates resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization. The Company performs regular evaluations of its universal life and annuity contracts to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. Assumptions considered significant include surrender and lapse rates, mortality, expense levels, investment performance, and estimated interest spread. Should actual experience dictate that the Company change its assumptions regarding the emergence of future revenues or profits (commonly referred to as unlocking\u201d), the Company would record a charge or addition to bring its DPAC balance to the level it would have been if using the new assumptions from the inception date of each policy.\nDPAC is also subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing. These tests ensure that the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized DPAC balance to be amortized in the future. The present value of these cash flows, less the benefit reserve, is compared with the unamortized DPAC balance and if the DPAC balance is greater, the deficiency is charged to expense as a component of amortization and the asset balance is reduced to the recoverable amount. For more information about accounting for DPAC see Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nDeferred Sales Inducements (\"DSI\"). Costs related to sales inducements offered on sales to new customers, principally on investment type contracts and primarily in the form of additional credits to the customer's account value or enhancements to interest credited for a specified period, which are beyond amounts currently being credited to existing contracts, are deferred and recorded as other assets. All other sales inducements are expensed as incurred and included in interest credited to contract holders' funds. Deferred sales inducements are amortized to income using the same methodology and assumptions as DPAC, and are included in interest credited to contract holders' funds. Deferred sales inducements are also periodically reviewed for recoverability. For more information about accounting for deferred sales inducements see Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nValue of Business Acquired (\"VOBA\"). VOBA is a purchase accounting convention for life insurance companies in business combinations based upon an actuarial determination of the difference between the fair value of policyholder liabilities acquired and the same policyholder liabilities measured in accordance with the acquiring company's accounting policies. The difference, referred to as VOBA, is an intangible asset subject to periodic amortization. Similar to DPAC and DSI, VOBA is subject to periodic analysis assessing recoverability.\nFuture Policy Benefits. Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, the Company is liable for policy benefit payments many years into the future. The liability for future policy benefits represents estimates of the present value of the Company's expected benefit payments, net of the related present value of future net premium collections. For traditional life insurance contracts, this is determined by standard actuarial procedures, using assumptions as to mortality (life expectancy), morbidity (health expectancy), persistency, and interest rates, which are based on the Company's experience with similar products. The assumptions used are those considered to be appropriate at the time the policies are issued. An additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions assumed. For universal life and annuity products, the Company's liability is the amount of the contract's account balance. Account balances are also subject to minimum liability calculations as a result of minimum guaranteed interest rates in the policies. While management and Company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits, there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents the Company's ultimate obligation. In addition, significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts. A discussion of the assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nRevenue Recognition. Premium income for the Company's traditional life insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium becomes due from policyholders. For annuity and universal life contracts, the amounts collected from policyholders are considered deposits and are not included in revenue. For these contracts, fee income consists of policy charges for policy administration, cost of insurance charges and surrender charges assessed against policyholders' account balances which are recognized in the period the services are provided.\nInvestment activities of the Company are integral to its insurance operations. Since life insurance benefits may not be paid until many years into the future, the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested with income reported as revenue when earned. Anticipated yields on investments are reflected in premium rates, contract liabilities, and other product contract features. These anticipated yields are implied in the interest required on the Company's net insurance liabilities (future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs) and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products. The Company benefits to the extent actual net investment income exceeds the required interest on net insurance liabilities and manages the rates it credits on its products to maintain the targeted excess or spread\u201d of investment earnings over interest credited. The Company will continue to be required to provide for future contractual obligations in the event of a decline in investment yield. For more information concerning revenue recognition, investment accounting, and interest sensitivity, please refer to Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note (3), Investments, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, and the discussions under Investments in Item 7 of this report.\nPension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits. The Company sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan, which was frozen effective December 31, 2007, covering substantially all employees at that time, and three non-qualified defined benefit plans covering certain senior officers. In addition, the Company has postretirement health care benefits for certain senior officers. The freeze of the qualified benefit pension plan ceased future benefit accruals to all participants and closed the Plan to any new participants. In addition, all participants became immediately 100% vested in their accrued benefits as of that date. In accordance with prescribed accounting standards, the Company annually reviews plan assumptions.\nThe Company annually reviews its pension benefit plans' assumptions which include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the compensation increase rate. The assumed discount rate is set based on the rates of return on high quality long-term fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally set at the rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the plans, the various classes of the invested funds, input of the plan's investment advisors and consulting actuary, and the plan's historic rate of return. The compensation rate increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation. These assumptions involve uncertainties and judgment, and therefore actual performance may not be reflective of the assumptions.\nOther postretirement benefit assumptions include future events affecting retirement age, mortality, dependency status, per capita claims costs by age, health care trend rates, and discount rates. Per capita claims cost by age is the current cost of providing postretirement health care benefits for one year at each age from the youngest age to the oldest age at which plan participants are expected to receive benefits under the plan. Health care trend rates involve assumptions about the annual rate(s) of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided by the plan, due to factors other than changes in the composition of the plan population by age and dependency status. These rates implicitly consider estimates of health care inflation, changes in utilization, technological advances, and changes in health status of the participants.\nShare-Based Payments. Liability awards under a share-based payment arrangement have been measured based on the awards' fair value at the reporting date. The Black-Scholes valuation method is used to estimate the fair value of the options. This fair value calculation of the options includes assumptions relative to the following:\n\nThese assumptions are continually reviewed by the Company and adjustments may be made based upon current facts and circumstances.\nOther significant accounting policies, although not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, but nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements, are described in Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). In addition, the Company regularly evaluates operating performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude or segregate derivative and realized investment gains and losses from operating revenues. Similar measures are commonly used in the insurance industry in order to assess profitability and results from ongoing operations. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the understanding of the Company's results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of the Company's business. The Company excludes or segregates derivative and realized investment gains and losses because such items are often the result of events which may or may not be at the Company's discretion and the fluctuating effects of these items could distort trends in the underlying profitability of the Company's business. Therefore, in the following sections discussing consolidated operations and segment operations, appropriate reconciliations have been included to report information management considers useful in enhancing an understanding of the Company's operations to reportable GAAP balances reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidated Operations\nRevenues. The following details Company revenues:\n\nUniversal life and annuity contract revenues - Revenues for universal life and annuity contract charges decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower surrender charge revenue from terminated policies and lower cost of insurance and administrative charges. Revenues for universal life and annuity products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances, less reinsurance premiums as depicted in the following table.\n\nCost of insurance charges were $98.9 million in 2020 compared to $102.0 million in 2019 and $105.9 million in 2018. Cost of insurance charges typically trend with the size of the universal life insurance block in force and the amount of new business issued during the period. The volume of universal life insurance in force during 2020 decreased to $13.5 billion from $14.4 billion at year-end 2019 and $15.6 billion at year-end 2018. Administrative charges were $25.9 million, $24.1 million, and $23.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and correlate with new universal life insurance business sales by the number of policies placed, the amount of premiums received and the volume of insurance issued. While National Western's decision in the second quarter of 2018 to cease accepting international policy applications from residents of other countries significantly decreased the level of universal life insurance sales, the Company's increasing domestic life sales have served to offset a substantial portion of this decline.\nSurrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances upon withdrawal were $26.6 million in 2020 compared to $33.1 million in 2019 and $37.1 million in 2018. The Company earns surrender charge income that is assessed upon policy terminations, however, the Company's overall profitability is enhanced when policies remain in force and additional contract revenues are realized and the Company continues to make an interest rate spread equivalent to the difference it earns on its investment and the amounts that it credits to policyholders. While policy lapse rates in 2020 for the domestic life insurance and international life insurance segments were somewhat lower than those experienced in 2019, the annuities segment exhibited a higher lapse rate due to liquidity demands prompted by the pandemic crisis. Surrender charge income recognized is also dependent upon the duration of policies at the time of surrender (i.e. later duration policy surrenders have lower surrender charges assessed and earlier policy surrenders have a higher surrender charge assessed). The declining trend in assessed surrender charges is indicative of policy surrenders later in the surrender charge period.\nOther charges include the net amortization into income of the premium load on single premium life insurance products which is deferred at the inception of the policy. As these products have become a substantial portion of the Company's new business the amortization of accumulated deferrals has surpassed current premium loads being deferred. As part of the Company's annual unlocking analysis, a prospective unlocking of the unearned revenue reserve was done for each year shown. The effect of the unlocking was an increase in other charges revenue of $5.9 million, $0.5 million, and $0.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nTraditional life premiums - Traditional life premiums in 2019 include the activity of Ozark National subsequent to their acquisition on January 31, 2019. Ozark National's principal product is a non-participating whole life insurance policy with premiums remitted primarily on a monthly basis. The product is sold in tandem with a mutual fund investment product offered through its broker-dealer affiliate, NIS. Traditional life insurance premiums for products such as whole life and term life are recognized as revenues over the premium-paying period. A sizable portion of National Western's traditional life business resided in the International Life insurance segment which ceased accepting new applications in 2018. However, National Western's overall life insurance sales focus has historically been primarily centered around universal life products. The addition of Ozark National's business of repetitive paying permanent life insurance adds an important complement to National Western's life insurance sales. Included in the amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is $74.8 million and $69.0 million, respectively, of life insurance renewal premium from Ozark National. Universal life products, especially National Western's equity indexed universal life products, which offer the opportunity for consumers to acquire life insurance protection and receive credited interest linked in part to an outside market index, have been the more popular product offerings in the Company's markets.\nNet investment income (with and without derivatives) - A detail of net investment income is provided below.\n\nDebt and equity securities generated approximately 92% of total investment income, excluding derivative gains and losses, in 2020 compared to 93% in 2019. The Company's strategy is to invest substantially all of its cash flows in fixed debt securities within its guidelines for credit quality, duration, and diversification. The higher level of investment income from debt and equity securities in 2019 versus 2018 reflects the addition of Ozark National. National Western's debt and equity securities investment income continues to experience higher yielding debt securities maturing or being called by borrowers and being replaced with lower yielding securities in the current interest rate environment. In addition, the excess of annuity outflows over inflows has caused the debt security portfolio to contract. With the acquisition of Ozark National and NIS in the first quarter of 2019, a substantial portion of National Western's investable cash resources were applied toward the purchase of the two companies and then subsequently to pay back line of credit borrowings of $75 million used to fund a part of the acquisition price.\nThe Company's investable funds are derived from incremental cash flow from new business and investment income from its portfolio above its operational requirements to pay policy benefits, commissions, and expenses. The debt securities portfolio increased from $10.2 billion at December 31, 2018 to $10.5 billion at December 31, 2019, reflecting the addition of Ozark National's $722.9 million debt security portfolio. The debt securities portfolio increased back to $10.8 billion at December 31, 2020, however the increase in balance was the result of recording certain holdings at fair value instead of amortized cost as had been done previously. Investment yields on new bond purchases in 2020 were less than the portfolio's weighted average yield after exceeding the portfolio yield in 2018 and 2019. The portfolio weighted average yield was approximately 3.68% at December 31, 2020, while the yield on debt security purchases to fund insurance operations was 3.33%, 4.06%, and 4.20% in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Ozark National's weighted average portfolio yield at December 31, 2020 was 3.66%. Although the yield on new purchases in 2018 and 2019 exceeded the portfolio weighted average yield, bond portfolio yields have continued to be impacted by higher yielding debt securities maturing or being called by borrowers with the proceeds being reinvested into lower yielding securities.\nEffective January 1, 2018, new accounting guidance required changes in fair values of equity securities to be included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings rather than as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Stockholders' Equity. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 an unrealized gain(loss) of $(1.0) million, $3.5 million, and ($1.8) million, respectively, has been included in net investment income reflecting the change in fair value of equity securities during the periods. The carrying value of the Company's portfolio of equity securities was $17.7 million at December 31, 2020.\nPrior to 2020, the Company's new mortgage loan activity had been impacted by the low level of rates and the highly competitive underwriting of commercial properties. The pandemic COVID-19 crisis further slowed down the underwriting of new loan applications early in 2020 until clarity regarding the impacts of closing down the economy upon commercial real estate became discernible. Eventually the volume of new mortgage loan originations during the latter half of 2020 approached the pace of that in 2019. The Company originated new mortgage loans in the amount of $80.2 million in 2020 as compared to $121.4 in 2019. Mortgage loan investment income also benefits from incremental contributions from loan prepayment fees and profit participation receipts.\nPolicy loan and other invested asset balances outstanding have remained relatively stable over the past few years. During the latter part of 2020, National Western, in order to obtain incremental investment yield, expanded its invested asset vehicles to include alternative investments. These assets are typically syndicated, targeted capital pools with specific investment objectives managed by investment firms having specific expertise in designated asset opportunities. At December 31, 2020, the Company held $28.9 million in this investment category.\nThe Company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to current expected credit losses on financial instruments (\"CECL\") in 2020. The adoption as of January 1, 2020 was reported as a change in accounting with initial balances recorded and charged to retained earnings. Remeasurement of the CECL allowance during 2020 resulted in a decrease in the allowance of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which is netted in gross investment income.\nIn order to evaluate underlying profitability and results from ongoing operations, net investment income performance is analyzed excluding derivative gain (loss), which is a common practice in the insurance industry. Although this is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, Company management believes this financial measure provides useful supplemental information by removing the swings associated with fair value changes on derivative instruments. Net investment income and average invested assets shown below includes cash and cash equivalents. Net investment income performance is summarized as follows:\n\nThe decline in average invested asset yield, excluding derivatives, from 2018 to 2019 and to 2020 is due to the Company continuing to obtain low yields on newly invested cash inflows as higher yielding assets mature or are called. The pattern in average invested asset yield, including derivatives, incorporates increases and decreases in the fair value of index options purchased by National Western to support its fixed-index products. Fair values of the purchased call options recorded net gains in 2020 and 2019 while recording a loss in 2018 corresponding to the movement in the S&P 500 Index\u00ae during these periods (the primary index the fixed-index products employ). Refer to the derivatives discussion following this section for a more detailed explanation.\nOther revenues - Other revenues pertain to NIS, the broker-dealer affiliate of Ozark National; the operations of Braker P III (\"BP III\"), a new subsidiary created at the end of 2016 to own and manage a commercial office building BP III acquired; and the Company's previously owned two nursing home operations in Reno, Nevada and San Marcos, Texas.\nNIS revenues were $9.9 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. NIS revenues in 2019 were for the period subsequent to its acquisition effective January 31, 2019.\nRevenues associated with BP III were $4.7 million, $3.9 million and $3.2 million in December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, reflecting additional tenant leases subsequently executed. The facility is currently fully leased.\nThe Company closed on the sale of its Reno nursing home operations effective February 1, 2019 and on the sale of its San Marcos nursing home operations effective May 1, 2019. Revenues associated with these operations were $(0.6) million, $4.3 million and $17.2 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating revenues for each nursing home entity were included in 2019 through their respective dates of sale. In addition, net gains from the sale of personal property and equipment at the Reno facility of $1.4 million are included in 2019 revenues.\nThe Company's acquisition of Ozark National (by National Western) included a contingent payment provision that was dependent upon the subsequent persistency of Ozark National's in force block of business that was acquired. The Company had been progressively accruing for this potential obligation in its financial statements. During 2020, the Company executed an agreement with the seller under which both parties agreed that the Company had fulfilled its payment obligation under the Stock Purchase Agreement executed October 3, 2018. Consequently, the Company reversed the contingent payment amounts previously accrued and recognized as Other revenues $4.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther revenues also include semi-annual distributions from the life interest in the Libbie Shearn Moody Trust. Revenues recognized from these distributions were $5.3 million, $6.7 million, and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nDerivative gain (loss) - Index options are derivative financial instruments used to hedge the equity return component of National Western's fixed-index products. Derivative gain or loss includes the amounts realized from the sale or expiration of the options. Since the index options do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP, they are marked to fair value on each reporting date and the resulting unrealized gain or loss is reflected as a component of net investment income. As the options hedging the notional amount of policyholder contract obligations are purchased as close as possible to like amounts, the amount of the options returns tend to correlate closely with indexed interest credited.\nGains and losses from index options are substantially due to changes in equity market conditions. Index options are intended to act as hedges to match the returns on the product's underlying reference index and the rise or decline in the index relative to the index level at the time of the option purchase which causes option values to likewise rise or decline. As income from index options fluctuates with the underlying index, the contract interest expense to policyholder accounts for the Company's fixed-index products also fluctuates in a similar manner and direction. The Company recorded derivative gain (loss) and contract interest amounts as shown below.\n\nThe economic impact of option performance in the Company's financial statements is not generally determined solely by the option gain or loss included in net investment income as there is a corresponding amount recorded in the contract interest expense line. The Company's profitability with respect to these options is largely dependent upon the purchase cost of the option remaining within the financial budget for acquiring options embedded in the product pricing. Option prices vary with interest rates, volatility, and dividend yields among other things. As option prices vary, the Company manages for the variability by making offsetting adjustments to product caps, participation rates, and management fees. For the periods shown, the Company's option costs have generally been within the product pricing budgets.\nThe financial statement investment spread, the difference between investment income and interest credited to contract holders, is subject to variations from option performance during any given period. For example, many of the Company's equity-index annuity products provide for the collection of asset management fees. These asset management fees are assessed when returns on expiring options are positive, and they are collected prior to passing any additional returns above the assessed management fees to the policy contractholders. During periods of positive returns, the collected asset management fees serve to increase the financial statement spread by increasing option realized gains reported as investment income in an amount greater than interest credited to policy contractholders which is reported as contract interest expense. Asset management fees collected in 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $30.7 million, $15.9 million, and $24.3 million, respectively.\nNet realized investment gains (losses) - Realized gains (losses) on investments generally include proceeds from bond calls, sales and impairment write-downs, as well as gains and losses on the sale of real estate property. Net gains reported in 2020 consisted of gross gains of $21.1 million which were mostly from bond calls, offset by gross losses of $0.0 million. Included the year ended December 31, 2019 gross gains is $5.7 million from the sale of land and building associated with the nursing home in Reno, Nevada and a $3.2 million gain on the sale of the Company's former Austin, Texas home office facility. Included in 2019 gross losses is a $2.0 million loss on the sale of the building pertaining to the San Marcos, Texas nursing home and an other-than-temporary impairment on a single debt security credit in the amount $7.8 million. Included in the gross gains in 2018 is $1.8 million from the sale of two buildings adjacent to the former home office property located in Austin, Texas which housed portions of National Western's operations.\nPrior to January 1, 2020 and the adoption of the new accounting guidance on current expected credit losses, the Company recorded impairment write-downs when a decline in value was considered to be other-than-temporary and full recovery of the investment is not expected. Impairments due to credit factors were recorded in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings while non-credit (liquidity) impairment losses were included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Under the new accounting guidance, credit loss allowances for available-for-sale debt securities are recorded following the same process previously applied for impairment accounting. Credit loss allowances are recorded through net investment income in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Impairment or valuation write-downs recorded prior to January 1, 2020 were completed under accounting guidance prior to adoption of the accounting standard update 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses and totaled $7.8 million and $0.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nBenefits and Expenses. The following details benefits and expenses.\n\nLife and other policy benefits - Life and other policy benefits include death claims of $72.5 million, $65.8 million and $44.9 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in the amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are $37.0 million and $29.3 million in death claims pertaining to Ozark National. Death claim amounts are subject to variation from period to period. Death claims in 2020 include net benefit amounts (after reinsurance) pertaining to death from COVID-19 of $5.1 million for National Western and $2.8 million for Ozark National. In 2020, the number of National Western life insurance claims increased 12% from 2019 and the average dollar amount per net claim declined 10% to $43,600. National Western's mortality experience has generally been consistent with or better than its product pricing assumptions. The average net claim for Ozark National during 2020 declined to $14,800 from the 2019 period amount of $15,300. The average face amount of insurance in force for Ozark National was $33,700 at December 31, 2020. Mortality exposure is managed through reinsurance treaties under which the Company's retained maximum net amount at risk on any one life is capped at $500,000. Ozark National's retained maximum net amount at risk is capped at $200,000 under its reinsurance treaties with limited exceptions related to the conversion of child protection and guaranteed insurability riders.\nLife and other policy benefits also includes policy liabilities held associated with the Company's traditional life products, including riders such as the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider (\"WBR\"), a popular rider to National Western's equity-indexed annuity products. The increases in these liabilities for National Western were $10.7 million, $24.4 million, and $7.3 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In each of these years, National Western unlocked its policy benefit reserves associated with the WBR which resulted in an increase(decrease) to the policy benefit liability of $(11.9) million, $0.7 million, and ($15.7) million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The 2020 adjustment included an unlocking amount pertaining to mortality experience on payout annuities with life contingencies.\nLife and other policy benefits in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 includes changes in traditional life reserves and miscellaneous benefit payments associated with Ozark National's operations of $30.7 million and $30.5 million, respectively, reflecting normal business conditions. The amounts for 2019 reflect activity subsequent to the acquisition date of January 31, 2019.\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired - Life insurance companies are required to defer certain expenses that vary with, and are directly related to, the cost of acquiring new business. The majority of these acquisition expenses consist of commissions paid to agents, underwriting costs, and certain marketing expenses. Recognition of these deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) as an expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements occurs over future periods in relation to the expected emergence of profits priced into the products sold. This emergence of profits is based upon assumptions regarding premium payment patterns, mortality, persistency, investment performance, and expense patterns. Companies are required to review universal life and annuity contract assumptions periodically to ascertain whether actual experience has deviated significantly from that assumed. If it is determined that a significant deviation has occurred, the emergence of profits pattern is to be \"unlocked\" and reset based upon the actual experience. DPAC balances are also adjusted each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience ( true-up\u201d) with the adjustment reflected in current period amortization expense. In accordance with GAAP guidance, the Company must also write off deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue liabilities upon internal replacement of certain contracts as well as annuitizations of deferred annuities.\nThe following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization expense components for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nThe amortization amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were comprised of DPAC amortization by National Western of $129.7 million and $108.4 million and by Ozark National of $0.6 million and $0.7 million. Ozark National's deferred policy acquisition cost balance was initiated February 1, 2019 following its acquisition by National Western.\nIn 2020, the Company unlocked its DPAC balances for: (1) mortality rates, lapse rates, portfolio yield rates and spreads, which collectively decreased DPAC balances (and increased amortization expense) on its Life segment by $7.4 million; and (2) surrender rates, annuitization rates, portfolio yield rates and spreads, mortality experience on payout annuities, and utilization of the Company's withdrawal benefit rider which collectively decreased DPAC balances (and increased amortization expense) on its Annuity segment by $15.0 million.\nIn 2019, the Company unlocked its DPAC balances for: (1) mortality rates, lapse rates, portfolio yield rates and spreads, and maintenance expense on its International life business which collectively increased DPAC balances (and reduced amortization expense) on its Life segment by $11.2 million; and (2) surrender rates, annuitization rates, portfolio yield rates and spreads, and utilization of the Company's withdrawal benefit rider which collectively decreased DPAC balances (and increased amortization expense) on its Annuity segment by $2.6 million.\nIn 2018, the Company unlocked its DPAC balances associated with its Life and Annuity segments for: (1) mortality, extended death benefit reserves, and the investment yield supporting universal life policy liabilities on its Life segment which collectively increased amortization expense by $1.2 million; and (2) mortality, the election rate of the Company's withdrawal benefit rider, and the investment yield supporting annuity contract accounts which collectively decreased amortization expense by $2.2 million for the Annuity segment.\nAs the DPAC balance is an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, GAAP provides for an earned interest return on the unamortized balance each period. The earned interest serves to increase the DPAC balance and reduce other amortization component expense. The rate at which the DPAC balance earns interest is the average credited interest rate on universal life and annuity policies in force, including credited interest on equity-indexed policies. The amount of earned interest on DPAC balances recorded was $17.2 million, $12.0 million, and $29.1 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, decreasing other amortization component expense. The reduced interest amount in 2019 reflects lower realized returns on equity-index products.\nAs part of the purchase accounting required with the acquisition of Ozark National effective January 31, 2019, the Company recorded an intangible asset of $145.8 million referred to as the value of business acquired (\"VOBA\"). VOBA represents the difference between the acquired assets and liabilities of Ozark National measured in accordance with the Company's accounting policies and the fair value of these same assets and liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the cash value of certain acquired reserves was increased which resulted in a commensurate $35.1 million increase in both the traditional life reserve liability and the related VOBA balance reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The VOBA balance sheet amount is amortized following a methodology similar to that used for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company's VOBA amortization was $10.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively.\nUniversal life and annuity contract interest - The Company closely monitors its credited interest rates on interest sensitive policies (National Western products), taking into consideration such factors as profitability goals, policyholder benefits, product marketability, and economic market conditions. As long-term interest rates change, the Company's credited interest rates are often adjusted accordingly, taking into consideration the factors described above. The difference between yields earned on investments over policy credited rates is often referred to as the \"interest spread.\"\nNational Western's approximated average credited rates, excluding and including equity-indexed products, were as follows:\n\nContract interest reported in financial statements also encompasses the performance of the index options associated with the Company's fixed-index products. As previously noted, the market value changes of these derivative features resulted in net realized and unrealized gains/(losses) in 2020, 2019, and 2018 of $14.8 million, $123.2 million, and $(80.0) million, respectively. In 2020, this figure was comprised of unrealized losses totaling $(9.7) million offset by realized gains of $24.5 million. In 2019, the amount consisted of unrealized gains of $153.0 million offset by realized losses of $(29.8) million. These returns similarly increased/(decreased) the computed average credited rates for the periods shown above. Policyholders of equity-indexed products cannot receive an interest credit below 0% according to the policy contract terms.\n\nContract interest expense includes reserve changes for immediate annuities, two tier annuities, excess death benefit reserves, excess annuitizations, and amortization of", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Certain information contained herein or in other written or oral statements made by or on behalf of National Western Life Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") are or may be viewed as forward-looking. Although the Company has taken appropriate care in developing any such information, forward-looking information involves risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact actual results. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, matters described in the Company's filings such as exposure to market risks, anticipated cash flows or operating performance, future capital needs, and statutory or regulatory related issues. However, as a matter of policy, the Company does not make any specific projections as to future earnings, nor does it endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by others. Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments. Also, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) of National Western Life Group, Inc. (\"NWLGI\") for the three years ended December 31, 2020 follows. Where appropriate, discussion specific to the insurance operations of National Western Life Insurance Company is denoted by \"National Western\" or \"NWLIC\". This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page 96 of this report.\nEffective January 31, 2019, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Ozark National Life Insurance Company (\"Ozark National\") and N.I.S. Financial Services, Inc. (\"NIS\") following the receipt of regulatory approvals. NWLGI and National Western paid cash in an aggregate amount of approximately $205.4 million in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of Ozark National (wholly owned by National Western) and NIS (wholly owned by NWLGI). The eleven month results of Ozark National and NIS are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and reference to each is made in this MD&A where appropriate.\nOverview\nNational Western has historically provided life insurance products on a global basis for the savings and protection needs of policyholders and issued annuity contracts for the asset accumulation and retirement needs of contract holders, both domestic and international residents. As disclosed in the Company's 2018 filings, the Company discontinued accepting applications for its international life insurance products from all foreign residents in other countries in the second quarter of 2018.\nThe Company, National Western and Ozark National, accepts funds from policyholders or contract holders and establishes a liability representing future obligations to pay the policy or contract holders and their beneficiaries. To ensure the Company will be able to pay these future commitments, the funds received as premium payments and deposits are invested in high quality investments, primarily fixed income securities.\nDue to the business of accepting funds to pay future obligations in later years and the underlying economics, the relevant factors affecting the Company's overall business and profitability include the following:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>the level of sales and premium revenues collected </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>the volume of life insurance and annuity business in force </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>persistency of policies and contracts </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>the ability to price products to earn acceptable margins over benefit costs and expenses </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>return on investments sufficient to produce acceptable spread margins over interest crediting rates </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>investment credit quality which minimizes the risk of default or impairment </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>levels of policy benefits and costs to acquire business </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>the ability to manage the level of operating expenses </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>effect of interest rate changes on revenues and investments including asset and liability matching </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>maintaining adequate levels of capital and surplus </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>corporate tax rates and the treatment of financial statement items under tax rules and accounting </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>actual levels of surrenders, withdrawals, claims and interest spreads </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>changes in assumptions for amortization of deferred policy acquisition expenses and deferred sales inducements </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>changes in the fair value of derivative index options and embedded derivatives pertaining to fixed-index life and annuity products </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>pricing and availability of adequate counterparties for reinsurance and index option contracts </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>litigation subject to unfavorable judicial development, including the time and expense of litigation </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company monitors these factors continually as key business indicators. The discussion that follows in this Item 7 includes these indicators and presents information useful to an overall understanding of the Company's business performance in 2020, incorporating required disclosures in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nImpact of Recent Business Environment\nThe Company's business is generally aided by an economic environment experiencing growth, whether moderate or vibrant, characterized by improving employment data and increases in personal income. Important metrics indicating sustained economic growth over the longer term principally revolve around employment and confidence, both consumer and business sentiment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic not only affected how businesses conducted operations but also introduced a great deal of uncertainty to the life insurance industry. A relevant consideration for the industry was how might the morbidity exposure of COVID-19 translate into a higher death claim incidence. The Company (National Western and Ozark National) incurred approximately $8.0 million in net death claims for which COVID-19 was identified as the cause of death which did not result in total death claims significantly higher than historical experience. The more significant consequence of the pandemic was the impact on asset valuations. Invested assets declined in value due to downgrades in credit market securities resulting in impairment-related losses or sizable additions being made to the allowance for current credit losses in financial statements. Consequently, there has been balance sheet asset deterioration, charges to capital, and lower reported earnings.\nIn recent years, in an attempt to acquire additional investment yield in the low rate environment, life insurers substantially increased allocations to BBB- rated bonds. In a recession, many of these investment grade corporate credits are at risk for downgrades, as well as the potential to default. Risk-based capital (RBC) formulas assess higher required capital charges as investment quality declines. A meaningful shift of BBB- rated debt securities to non-investment grade categories could have significant implications in terms of required capital levels which would depress RBC ratios of impacted insurers. Life insurance companies also have a large exposure to real estate in its investment portfolios through commercial mortgage, direct real estate investment, alternative investment funds, and mortgage-backed securities. These investments are highly dependent upon occupancy and payment of rent and lease obligations. The quarantine and shelter-at-home lockdown affect the ability to meet these payment obligations.\nLife insurance revenues are driven more by renewal premiums than sales. Most state insurance departments have issued directives instructing insurers to allow premium payments to fall into arrears. New life insurance sales face the challenge of having to forego face-to-face consultation with agents and distributors. In addition, full medical underwriting, which is a cornerstone of evaluating risk when an insurer makes the decision to offer coverage and at what level of coverage, will likely be unavailable or difficult to complete as a medical test for life insurance applications will not be considered as \"essential\" in a pandemic environment.\nWith regard to the credit market, although not probable in the current environment, industry analysts and observers generally agree that a sudden jump in interest rate levels would be harmful to life insurers with interest-sensitive products as it could provide an impetus for abnormal levels of product surrenders and withdrawals at the same time fixed debt securities held by insurers declined in market value. Ultimately, a mix of monetary policy adjustments, fiscal policy, and economic fundamentals will determine the future direction of interest rate movements and the speed of such shifts. It is uncertain at what pace interest rate movements may occur in the future and what impact, if any, such movements would have on the Company's business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn an environment such as this, the need for a strong capital position that can cushion against unexpected bumps is critical for stability and ongoing business activity. The Company's operating strategy continues to be focused on maintaining capital levels substantially above regulatory and rating agency requirements. Our business model is predicated upon steady growth in invested assets while managing the block of business within profitability objectives. A key premise of our financial management is maintaining a high quality investment portfolio, well matched in terms of duration with policyholder obligations, that continues to outperform the industry with respect to adverse impairment experience. This discipline enables the Company to sustain resources more than adequate to fund future growth and absorb abnormal periods of cash outflows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAccounting policies discussed below are those considered critical to an understanding of the Company's financial statements.\nImpairment of Investment Securities. The Company's accounting policy requires that a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost basis be evaluated to determine if the decline is a result of credit loss. The primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for fixed income and equity securities without readily determinable fair values is a result of credit loss are: (a) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (b) the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, interest rate related, credit spread widening), (c) the overall financial condition as well as the near-term prospects of the issuer, (d) whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated principal and interest payments, and (e) that the Company does not intend or be required to sell the investment prior to recovery. In addition, certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows are evaluated periodically by the Company to update the estimated cash flows over the life of the security. If the Company determines that the fair value of the securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the previous purchase or prior impairment, then a credit loss charge is recognized. The Company would recognize impairment of securities due to changing interest rates or market dislocations only if the Company intended to sell the securities prior to recovery. When a security is deemed to be impaired, a charge is recorded equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security. In compliance with GAAP guidance the estimated credit loss is recorded as an allowance with changes in the allowance recorded to Net investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs ( DPAC\u201d). The Company is required to defer certain policy acquisition costs and amortize them over future periods. These costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are directly associated with acquiring new business. The deferred costs are recorded as an asset commonly referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs. The DPAC asset balance is subsequently charged to income over the lives of the underlying contracts in relation to the anticipated emergence of revenue or profits. Actual revenue or profits can vary from Company estimates resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization. The Company performs regular evaluations of its universal life and annuity contracts to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. Assumptions considered significant include surrender and lapse rates, mortality, expense levels, investment performance, and estimated interest spread. Should actual experience dictate that the Company change its assumptions regarding the emergence of future revenues or profits (commonly referred to as unlocking\u201d), the Company would record a charge or addition to bring its DPAC balance to the level it would have been if using the new assumptions from the inception date of each policy.\nDPAC is also subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing. These tests ensure that the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized DPAC balance to be amortized in the future. The present value of these cash flows, less the benefit reserve, is compared with the unamortized DPAC balance and if the DPAC balance is greater, the deficiency is charged to expense as a component of amortization and the asset balance is reduced to the recoverable amount. For more information about accounting for DPAC see Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nDeferred Sales Inducements (\"DSI\"). Costs related to sales inducements offered on sales to new customers, principally on investment type contracts and primarily in the form of additional credits to the customer's account value or enhancements to interest credited for a specified period, which are beyond amounts currently being credited to existing contracts, are deferred and recorded as other assets. All other sales inducements are expensed as incurred and included in interest credited to contract holders' funds. Deferred sales inducements are amortized to income using the same methodology and assumptions as DPAC, and are included in interest credited to contract holders' funds. Deferred sales inducements are also periodically reviewed for recoverability. For more information about accounting for deferred sales inducements see Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nValue of Business Acquired (\"VOBA\"). VOBA is a purchase accounting convention for life insurance companies in business combinations based upon an actuarial determination of the difference between the fair value of policyholder liabilities acquired and the same policyholder liabilities measured in accordance with the acquiring company's accounting policies. The difference, referred to as VOBA, is an intangible asset subject to periodic amortization. Similar to DPAC and DSI, VOBA is subject to periodic analysis assessing recoverability.\nFuture Policy Benefits. Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, the Company is liable for policy benefit payments many years into the future. The liability for future policy benefits represents estimates of the present value of the Company's expected benefit payments, net of the related present value of future net premium collections. For traditional life insurance contracts, this is determined by standard actuarial procedures, using assumptions as to mortality (life expectancy), morbidity (health expectancy), persistency, and interest rates, which are based on the Company's experience with similar products. The assumptions used are those considered to be appropriate at the time the policies are issued. An additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions assumed. For universal life and annuity products, the Company's liability is the amount of the contract's account balance. Account balances are also subject to minimum liability calculations as a result of minimum guaranteed interest rates in the policies. While management and Company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits, there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents the Company's ultimate obligation. In addition, significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts. A discussion of the assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nRevenue Recognition. Premium income for the Company's traditional life insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium becomes due from policyholders. For annuity and universal life contracts, the amounts collected from policyholders are considered deposits and are not included in revenue. For these contracts, fee income consists of policy charges for policy administration, cost of insurance charges and surrender charges assessed against policyholders' account balances which are recognized in the period the services are provided.\nInvestment activities of the Company are integral to its insurance operations. Since life insurance benefits may not be paid until many years into the future, the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested with income reported as revenue when earned. Anticipated yields on investments are reflected in premium rates, contract liabilities, and other product contract features. These anticipated yields are implied in the interest required on the Company's net insurance liabilities (future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs) and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products. The Company benefits to the extent actual net investment income exceeds the required interest on net insurance liabilities and manages the rates it credits on its products to maintain the targeted excess or spread\u201d of investment earnings over interest credited. The Company will continue to be required to provide for future contractual obligations in the event of a decline in investment yield. For more information concerning revenue recognition, investment accounting, and interest sensitivity, please refer to Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note (3), Investments, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, and the discussions under Investments in Item 7 of this report.\nPension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits. The Company sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan, which was frozen effective December 31, 2007, covering substantially all employees at that time, and three non-qualified defined benefit plans covering certain senior officers. In addition, the Company has postretirement health care benefits for certain senior officers. The freeze of the qualified benefit pension plan ceased future benefit accruals to all participants and closed the Plan to any new participants. In addition, all participants became immediately 100% vested in their accrued benefits as of that date. In accordance with prescribed accounting standards, the Company annually reviews plan assumptions.\nThe Company annually reviews its pension benefit plans' assumptions which include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the compensation increase rate. The assumed discount rate is set based on the rates of return on high quality long-term fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally set at the rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the plans, the various classes of the invested funds, input of the plan's investment advisors and consulting actuary, and the plan's historic rate of return. The compensation rate increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation. These assumptions involve uncertainties and judgment, and therefore actual performance may not be reflective of the assumptions.\nOther postretirement benefit assumptions include future events affecting retirement age, mortality, dependency status, per capita claims costs by age, health care trend rates, and discount rates. Per capita claims cost by age is the current cost of providing postretirement health care benefits for one year at each age from the youngest age to the oldest age at which plan participants are expected to receive benefits under the plan. Health care trend rates involve assumptions about the annual rate(s) of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided by the plan, due to factors other than changes in the composition of the plan population by age and dependency status. These rates implicitly consider estimates of health care inflation, changes in utilization, technological advances, and changes in health status of the participants.\nShare-Based Payments. Liability awards under a share-based payment arrangement have been measured based on the awards' fair value at the reporting date. The Black-Scholes valuation method is used to estimate the fair value of the options. This fair value calculation of the options includes assumptions relative to the following:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>exercise price </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>expected term based on contractual term and perceived future behavior relative to exercise </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>current price </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>expected volatility </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>risk-free interest rates </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u25cf </td> <td>expected dividends </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese assumptions are continually reviewed by the Company and adjustments may be made based upon current facts and circumstances.\nOther significant accounting policies, although not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, but nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements, are described in Note (1), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). In addition, the Company regularly evaluates operating performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude or segregate derivative and realized investment gains and losses from operating revenues. Similar measures are commonly used in the insurance industry in order to assess profitability and results from ongoing operations. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the understanding of the Company's results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of the Company's business. The Company excludes or segregates derivative and realized investment gains and losses because such items are often the result of events which may or may not be at the Company's discretion and the fluctuating effects of these items could distort trends in the underlying profitability of the Company's business. Therefore, in the following sections discussing consolidated operations and segment operations, appropriate reconciliations have been included to report information management considers useful in enhancing an understanding of the Company's operations to reportable GAAP balances reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidated Operations\nRevenues. The following details Company revenues:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and annuity contract charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional life premiums </td> <td>92,542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,291 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives) </td> <td>402,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>429,081 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues </td> <td>18,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss) </td> <td>14,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80,004) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains (losses) </td> <td>21,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,423 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>694,742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>819,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>551,599 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUniversal life and annuity contract revenues - Revenues for universal life and annuity contract charges decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower surrender charge revenue from terminated policies and lower cost of insurance and administrative charges. Revenues for universal life and annuity products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances, less reinsurance premiums as depicted in the following table.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract Charges: </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of insurance and administrative charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129,591 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surrender charges </td> <td>26,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,138 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other charges </td> <td>11,430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,040 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contract revenues </td> <td>162,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172,769 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance premiums </td> <td>(17,469) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,578) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,564) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contract charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of insurance charges were $98.9 million in 2020 compared to $102.0 million in 2019 and $105.9 million in 2018. Cost of insurance charges typically trend with the size of the universal life insurance block in force and the amount of new business issued during the period. The volume of universal life insurance in force during 2020 decreased to $13.5 billion from $14.4 billion at year-end 2019 and $15.6 billion at year-end 2018. Administrative charges were $25.9 million, $24.1 million, and $23.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and correlate with new universal life insurance business sales by the number of policies placed, the amount of premiums received and the volume of insurance issued. While National Western's decision in the second quarter of 2018 to cease accepting international policy applications from residents of other countries significantly decreased the level of universal life insurance sales, the Company's increasing domestic life sales have served to offset a substantial portion of this decline.\nSurrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances upon withdrawal were $26.6 million in 2020 compared to $33.1 million in 2019 and $37.1 million in 2018. The Company earns surrender charge income that is assessed upon policy terminations, however, the Company's overall profitability is enhanced when policies remain in force and additional contract revenues are realized and the Company continues to make an interest rate spread equivalent to the difference it earns on its investment and the amounts that it credits to policyholders. While policy lapse rates in 2020 for the domestic life insurance and international life insurance segments were somewhat lower than those experienced in 2019, the annuities segment exhibited a higher lapse rate due to liquidity demands prompted by the pandemic crisis. Surrender charge income recognized is also dependent upon the duration of policies at the time of surrender (i.e. later duration policy surrenders have lower surrender charges assessed and earlier policy surrenders have a higher surrender charge assessed). The declining trend in assessed surrender charges is indicative of policy surrenders later in the surrender charge period.\nOther charges include the net amortization into income of the premium load on single premium life insurance products which is deferred at the inception of the policy. As these products have become a substantial portion of the Company's new business the amortization of accumulated deferrals has surpassed current premium loads being deferred. As part of the Company's annual unlocking analysis, a prospective unlocking of the unearned revenue reserve was done for each year shown. The effect of the unlocking was an increase in other charges revenue of $5.9 million, $0.5 million, and $0.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nTraditional life premiums - Traditional life premiums in 2019 include the activity of Ozark National subsequent to their acquisition on January 31, 2019. Ozark National's principal product is a non-participating whole life insurance policy with premiums remitted primarily on a monthly basis. The product is sold in tandem with a mutual fund investment product offered through its broker-dealer affiliate, NIS. Traditional life insurance premiums for products such as whole life and term life are recognized as revenues over the premium-paying period. A sizable portion of National Western's traditional life business resided in the International Life insurance segment which ceased accepting new applications in 2018. However, National Western's overall life insurance sales focus has historically been primarily centered around universal life products. The addition of Ozark National's business of repetitive paying permanent life insurance adds an important complement to National Western's life insurance sales. Included in the amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is $74.8 million and $69.0 million, respectively, of life insurance renewal premium from Ozark National. Universal life products, especially National Western's equity indexed universal life products, which offer the opportunity for consumers to acquire life insurance protection and receive credited interest linked in part to an outside market index, have been the more popular product offerings in the Company's markets.\nNet investment income (with and without derivatives) - A detail of net investment income is provided below.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross investment income: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt and equities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>373,479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>403,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>399,645 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans </td> <td>13,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,066 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy loans </td> <td>3,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments </td> <td>2,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,249 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other invested assets </td> <td>12,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,289 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income </td> <td>404,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>435,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430,434 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: investment expenses </td> <td>2,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,353 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (excluding derivatives) </td> <td>402,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>429,081 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative gain (loss) </td> <td>14,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80,004) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>417,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>555,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>349,077 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt and equity securities generated approximately 92% of total investment income, excluding derivative gains and losses, in 2020 compared to 93% in 2019. The Company's strategy is to invest substantially all of its cash flows in fixed debt securities within its guidelines for credit quality, duration, and diversification. The higher level of investment income from debt and equity securities in 2019 versus 2018 reflects the addition of Ozark National. National Western's debt and equity securities investment income continues to experience higher yielding debt securities maturing or being called by borrowers and being replaced with lower yielding securities in the current interest rate environment. In addition, the excess of annuity outflows over inflows has caused the debt security portfolio to contract. With the acquisition of Ozark National and NIS in the first quarter of 2019, a substantial portion of National Western's investable cash resources were applied toward the purchase of the two companies and then subsequently to pay back line of credit borrowings of $75 million used to fund a part of the acquisition price.\nThe Company's investable funds are derived from incremental cash flow from new business and investment income from its portfolio above its operational requirements to pay policy benefits, commissions, and expenses. The debt securities portfolio increased from $10.2 billion at December 31, 2018 to $10.5 billion at December 31, 2019, reflecting the addition of Ozark National's $722.9 million debt security portfolio. The debt securities portfolio increased back to $10.8 billion at December 31, 2020, however the increase in balance was the result of recording certain holdings at fair value instead of amortized cost as had been done previously. Investment yields on new bond purchases in 2020 were less than the portfolio's weighted average yield after exceeding the portfolio yield in 2018 and 2019. The portfolio weighted average yield was approximately 3.68% at December 31, 2020, while the yield on debt security purchases to fund insurance operations was 3.33%, 4.06%, and 4.20% in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Ozark National's weighted average portfolio yield at December 31, 2020 was 3.66%. Although the yield on new purchases in 2018 and 2019 exceeded the portfolio weighted average yield, bond portfolio yields have continued to be impacted by higher yielding debt securities maturing or being called by borrowers with the proceeds being reinvested into lower yielding securities.\nEffective January 1, 2018, new accounting guidance required changes in fair values of equity securities to be included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings rather than as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Stockholders' Equity. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 an unrealized gain(loss) of $(1.0) million, $3.5 million, and ($1.8) million, respectively, has been included in net investment income reflecting the change in fair value of equity securities during the periods. The carrying value of the Company's portfolio of equity securities was $17.7 million at December 31, 2020.\nPrior to 2020, the Company's new mortgage loan activity had been impacted by the low level of rates and the highly competitive underwriting of commercial properties. The pandemic COVID-19 crisis further slowed down the underwriting of new loan applications early in 2020 until clarity regarding the impacts of closing down the economy upon commercial real estate became discernible. Eventually the volume of new mortgage loan originations during the latter half of 2020 approached the pace of that in 2019. The Company originated new mortgage loans in the amount of $80.2 million in 2020 as compared to $121.4 in 2019. Mortgage loan investment income also benefits from incremental contributions from loan prepayment fees and profit participation receipts.\nPolicy loan and other invested asset balances outstanding have remained relatively stable over the past few years. During the latter part of 2020, National Western, in order to obtain incremental investment yield, expanded its invested asset vehicles to include alternative investments. These assets are typically syndicated, targeted capital pools with specific investment objectives managed by investment firms having specific expertise in designated asset opportunities. At December 31, 2020, the Company held $28.9 million in this investment category.\nThe Company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to current expected credit losses on financial instruments (\"CECL\") in 2020. The adoption as of January 1, 2020 was reported as a change in accounting with initial balances recorded and charged to retained earnings. Remeasurement of the CECL allowance during 2020 resulted in a decrease in the allowance of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which is netted in gross investment income.\nIn order to evaluate underlying profitability and results from ongoing operations, net investment income performance is analyzed excluding derivative gain (loss), which is a common practice in the insurance industry. Although this is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, Company management believes this financial measure provides useful supplemental information by removing the swings associated with fair value changes on derivative instruments. Net investment income and average invested assets shown below includes cash and cash equivalents. Net investment income performance is summarized as follows:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excluding derivatives: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>402,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>429,081 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average invested assets, at amortized cost </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,994,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,881,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,758,315 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual yield on average invested assets </td> <td> </td> <td>3.66 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.97 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.99 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Including derivatives: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>417,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>555,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>349,077 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average invested assets, at amortized cost </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,139,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,967,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,863,022 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual yield on average invested assets </td> <td> </td> <td>3.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.07 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decline in average invested asset yield, excluding derivatives, from 2018 to 2019 and to 2020 is due to the Company continuing to obtain low yields on newly invested cash inflows as higher yielding assets mature or are called. The pattern in average invested asset yield, including derivatives, incorporates increases and decreases in the fair value of index options purchased by National Western to support its fixed-index products. Fair values of the purchased call options recorded net gains in 2020 and 2019 while recording a loss in 2018 corresponding to the movement in the S&P 500 Index\u00ae during these periods (the primary index the fixed-index products employ). Refer to the derivatives discussion following this section for a more detailed explanation.\nOther revenues - Other revenues pertain to NIS, the broker-dealer affiliate of Ozark National; the operations of Braker P III (\"BP III\"), a new subsidiary created at the end of 2016 to own and manage a commercial office building BP III acquired; and the Company's previously owned two nursing home operations in Reno, Nevada and San Marcos, Texas.\nNIS revenues were $9.9 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. NIS revenues in 2019 were for the period subsequent to its acquisition effective January 31, 2019.\nRevenues associated with BP III were $4.7 million, $3.9 million and $3.2 million in December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, reflecting additional tenant leases subsequently executed. The facility is currently fully leased.\nThe Company closed on the sale of its Reno nursing home operations effective February 1, 2019 and on the sale of its San Marcos nursing home operations effective May 1, 2019. Revenues associated with these operations were $(0.6) million, $4.3 million and $17.2 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating revenues for each nursing home entity were included in 2019 through their respective dates of sale. In addition, net gains from the sale of personal property and equipment at the Reno facility of $1.4 million are included in 2019 revenues.\nThe Company's acquisition of Ozark National (by National Western) included a contingent payment provision that was dependent upon the subsequent persistency of Ozark National's in force block of business that was acquired. The Company had been progressively accruing for this potential obligation in its financial statements. During 2020, the Company executed an agreement with the seller under which both parties agreed that the Company had fulfilled its payment obligation under the Stock Purchase Agreement executed October 3, 2018. Consequently, the Company reversed the contingent payment amounts previously accrued and recognized as Other revenues $4.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther revenues also include semi-annual distributions from the life interest in the Libbie Shearn Moody Trust. Revenues recognized from these distributions were $5.3 million, $6.7 million, and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nDerivative gain (loss) - Index options are derivative financial instruments used to hedge the equity return component of National Western's fixed-index products. Derivative gain or loss includes the amounts realized from the sale or expiration of the options. Since the index options do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP, they are marked to fair value on each reporting date and the resulting unrealized gain or loss is reflected as a component of net investment income. As the options hedging the notional amount of policyholder contract obligations are purchased as close as possible to like amounts, the amount of the options returns tend to correlate closely with indexed interest credited.\nGains and losses from index options are substantially due to changes in equity market conditions. Index options are intended to act as hedges to match the returns on the product's underlying reference index and the rise or decline in the index relative to the index level at the time of the option purchase which causes option values to likewise rise or decline. As income from index options fluctuates with the underlying index, the contract interest expense to policyholder accounts for the Company's fixed-index products also fluctuates in a similar manner and direction. The Company recorded derivative gain (loss) and contract interest amounts as shown below.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,740) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(191,654) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gain (loss) </td> <td>24,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,786) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,650 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gain (loss) included in net investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80,004) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contract interest </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,055 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe economic impact of option performance in the Company's financial statements is not generally determined solely by the option gain or loss included in net investment income as there is a corresponding amount recorded in the contract interest expense line. The Company's profitability with respect to these options is largely dependent upon the purchase cost of the option remaining within the financial budget for acquiring options embedded in the product pricing. Option prices vary with interest rates, volatility, and dividend yields among other things. As option prices vary, the Company manages for the variability by making offsetting adjustments to product caps, participation rates, and management fees. For the periods shown, the Company's option costs have generally been within the product pricing budgets.\nThe financial statement investment spread, the difference between investment income and interest credited to contract holders, is subject to variations from option performance during any given period. For example, many of the Company's equity-index annuity products provide for the collection of asset management fees. These asset management fees are assessed when returns on expiring options are positive, and they are collected prior to passing any additional returns above the assessed management fees to the policy contractholders. During periods of positive returns, the collected asset management fees serve to increase the financial statement spread by increasing option realized gains reported as investment income in an amount greater than interest credited to policy contractholders which is reported as contract interest expense. Asset management fees collected in 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $30.7 million, $15.9 million, and $24.3 million, respectively.\nNet realized investment gains (losses) - Realized gains (losses) on investments generally include proceeds from bond calls, sales and impairment write-downs, as well as gains and losses on the sale of real estate property. Net gains reported in 2020 consisted of gross gains of $21.1 million which were mostly from bond calls, offset by gross losses of $0.0 million. Included the year ended December 31, 2019 gross gains is $5.7 million from the sale of land and building associated with the nursing home in Reno, Nevada and a $3.2 million gain on the sale of the Company's former Austin, Texas home office facility. Included in 2019 gross losses is a $2.0 million loss on the sale of the building pertaining to the San Marcos, Texas nursing home and an other-than-temporary impairment on a single debt security credit in the amount $7.8 million. Included in the gross gains in 2018 is $1.8 million from the sale of two buildings adjacent to the former home office property located in Austin, Texas which housed portions of National Western's operations.\nPrior to January 1, 2020 and the adoption of the new accounting guidance on current expected credit losses, the Company recorded impairment write-downs when a decline in value was considered to be other-than-temporary and full recovery of the investment is not expected. Impairments due to credit factors were recorded in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings while non-credit (liquidity) impairment losses were included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Under the new accounting guidance, credit loss allowances for available-for-sale debt securities are recorded following the same process previously applied for impairment accounting. Credit loss allowances are recorded through net investment income in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Impairment or valuation write-downs recorded prior to January 1, 2020 were completed under accounting guidance prior to adoption of the accounting standard update 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses and totaled $7.8 million and $0.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nBenefits and Expenses. The following details benefits and expenses.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life and other policy benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,297 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired </td> <td>140,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and annuity contract interest </td> <td>206,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,055 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses </td> <td>104,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93,969 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>582,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>654,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>410,092 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLife and other policy benefits - Life and other policy benefits include death claims of $72.5 million, $65.8 million and $44.9 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in the amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are $37.0 million and $29.3 million in death claims pertaining to Ozark National. Death claim amounts are subject to variation from period to period. Death claims in 2020 include net benefit amounts (after reinsurance) pertaining to death from COVID-19 of $5.1 million for National Western and $2.8 million for Ozark National. In 2020, the number of National Western life insurance claims increased 12% from 2019 and the average dollar amount per net claim declined 10% to $43,600. National Western's mortality experience has generally been consistent with or better than its product pricing assumptions. The average net claim for Ozark National during 2020 declined to $14,800 from the 2019 period amount of $15,300. The average face amount of insurance in force for Ozark National was $33,700 at December 31, 2020. Mortality exposure is managed through reinsurance treaties under which the Company's retained maximum net amount at risk on any one life is capped at $500,000. Ozark National's retained maximum net amount at risk is capped at $200,000 under its reinsurance treaties with limited exceptions related to the conversion of child protection and guaranteed insurability riders.\nLife and other policy benefits also includes policy liabilities held associated with the Company's traditional life products, including riders such as the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider (\"WBR\"), a popular rider to National Western's equity-indexed annuity products. The increases in these liabilities for National Western were $10.7 million, $24.4 million, and $7.3 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In each of these years, National Western unlocked its policy benefit reserves associated with the WBR which resulted in an increase(decrease) to the policy benefit liability of $(11.9) million, $0.7 million, and ($15.7) million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The 2020 adjustment included an unlocking amount pertaining to mortality experience on payout annuities with life contingencies.\nLife and other policy benefits in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 includes changes in traditional life reserves and miscellaneous benefit payments associated with Ozark National's operations of $30.7 million and $30.5 million, respectively, reflecting normal business conditions. The amounts for 2019 reflect activity subsequent to the acquisition date of January 31, 2019.\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired - Life insurance companies are required to defer certain expenses that vary with, and are directly related to, the cost of acquiring new business. The majority of these acquisition expenses consist of commissions paid to agents, underwriting costs, and certain marketing expenses. Recognition of these deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) as an expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements occurs over future periods in relation to the expected emergence of profits priced into the products sold. This emergence of profits is based upon assumptions regarding premium payment patterns, mortality, persistency, investment performance, and expense patterns. Companies are required to review universal life and annuity contract assumptions periodically to ascertain whether actual experience has deviated significantly from that assumed. If it is determined that a significant deviation has occurred, the emergence of profits pattern is to be \"unlocked\" and reset based upon the actual experience. DPAC balances are also adjusted each period to reflect current policy lapse or termination rates, expense levels and credited rates on policies as compared to anticipated experience ( true-up\u201d) with the adjustment reflected in current period amortization expense. In accordance with GAAP guidance, the Company must also write off deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue liabilities upon internal replacement of certain contracts as well as annuitizations of deferred annuities.\nThe following table identifies the effects of unlocking adjustments on DPAC balances recorded through amortization expense separate from recurring amortization expense components for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DPAC </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,643) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(950) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other amortization components </td> <td>107,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,721 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amortization amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were comprised of DPAC amortization by National Western of $129.7 million and $108.4 million and by Ozark National of $0.6 million and $0.7 million. Ozark National's deferred policy acquisition cost balance was initiated February 1, 2019 following its acquisition by National Western.\nIn 2020, the Company unlocked its DPAC balances for: (1) mortality rates, lapse rates, portfolio yield rates and spreads, which collectively decreased DPAC balances (and increased amortization expense) on its Life segment by $7.4 million; and (2) surrender rates, annuitization rates, portfolio yield rates and spreads, mortality experience on payout annuities, and utilization of the Company's withdrawal benefit rider which collectively decreased DPAC balances (and increased amortization expense) on its Annuity segment by $15.0 million.\nIn 2019, the Company unlocked its DPAC balances for: (1) mortality rates, lapse rates, portfolio yield rates and spreads, and maintenance expense on its International life business which collectively increased DPAC balances (and reduced amortization expense) on its Life segment by $11.2 million; and (2) surrender rates, annuitization rates, portfolio yield rates and spreads, and utilization of the Company's withdrawal benefit rider which collectively decreased DPAC balances (and increased amortization expense) on its Annuity segment by $2.6 million.\nIn 2018, the Company unlocked its DPAC balances associated with its Life and Annuity segments for: (1) mortality, extended death benefit reserves, and the investment yield supporting universal life policy liabilities on its Life segment which collectively increased amortization expense by $1.2 million; and (2) mortality, the election rate of the Company's withdrawal benefit rider, and the investment yield supporting annuity contract accounts which collectively decreased amortization expense by $2.2 million for the Annuity segment.\nAs the DPAC balance is an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, GAAP provides for an earned interest return on the unamortized balance each period. The earned interest serves to increase the DPAC balance and reduce other amortization component expense. The rate at which the DPAC balance earns interest is the average credited interest rate on universal life and annuity policies in force, including credited interest on equity-indexed policies. The amount of earned interest on DPAC balances recorded was $17.2 million, $12.0 million, and $29.1 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, decreasing other amortization component expense. The reduced interest amount in 2019 reflects lower realized returns on equity-index products.\nAs part of the purchase accounting required with the acquisition of Ozark National effective January 31, 2019, the Company recorded an intangible asset of $145.8 million referred to as the value of business acquired (\"VOBA\"). VOBA represents the difference between the acquired assets and liabilities of Ozark National measured in accordance with the Company's accounting policies and the fair value of these same assets and liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the cash value of certain acquired reserves was increased which resulted in a commensurate $35.1 million increase in both the traditional life reserve liability and the related VOBA balance reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The VOBA balance sheet amount is amortized following a methodology similar to that used for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company's VOBA amortization was $10.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively.\nUniversal life and annuity contract interest - The Company closely monitors its credited interest rates on interest sensitive policies (National Western products), taking into consideration such factors as profitability goals, policyholder benefits, product marketability, and economic market conditions. As long-term interest rates change, the Company's credited interest rates are often adjusted accordingly, taking into consideration the factors described above. The difference between yields earned on investments over policy credited rates is often referred to as the \"interest spread.\"\nNational Western's approximated average credited rates, excluding and including equity-indexed products, were as follows:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Excluding fixed-index products) </td> <td> </td> <td>(Including fixed-index products) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity </td> <td>1.92 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.07 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest sensitive life </td> <td>3.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.88 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.61 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContract interest reported in financial statements also encompasses the performance of the index options associated with the Company's fixed-index products. As previously noted, the market value changes of these derivative features resulted in net realized and unrealized gains/(losses) in 2020, 2019, and 2018 of $14.8 million, $123.2 million, and $(80.0) million, respectively. In 2020, this figure was comprised of unrealized losses totaling $(9.7) million offset by realized gains of $24.5 million. In 2019, the amount consisted of unrealized gains of $153.0 million offset by realized losses of $(29.8) million. These returns similarly increased/(decreased) the computed average credited rates for the periods shown above. Policyholders of equity-indexed products cannot receive an interest credit below 0% according to the policy contract terms.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract Interest Expense </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve changes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,764 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking adjustments </td> <td> </td> <td>17,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,904 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset management fees collected </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,675) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,856) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,266) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected asset management fees </td> <td> </td> <td>34,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,600) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,650 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other embedded derivative components </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,188) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,214) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,900) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,838 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContract interest expense includes reserve changes for immediate annuities, two tier annuities, excess death benefit reserves, excess annuitizations, and amortization of"}
