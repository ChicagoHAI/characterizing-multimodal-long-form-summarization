In addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision products, the Company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support, consulting, and training services to its customers; however, service revenue accounted for less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.\nCognex machine vision is primarily used to automate manufacturing and distribution processes in a variety of industries, where the technology is widely recognized as an important component of automated production and quality assurance. Virtually every manufacturer can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, Cognex products are used by a broad base of customers across a variety of industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. Cognex products are also used outside of the manufacturing sector to automate distribution processes in the logistics industry for applications in retail distribution and ecommerce to scan, track, and sort goods through distribution centers.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" using the full retrospective method to present all periods reported on a consistent basis. Accordingly, prior period revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit have been restated to apply the provisions of this ASC.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $806,338,000, representing an increase of 5% over 2017. Lower revenue from customers in the consumer electronics industry was offset by higher revenue across a variety of other industries, including the logistics and automotive industries. Gross margin was 74.4% of revenue in 2018 compared to 75.6% of revenue in 2017 due primarily to a higher percentage of total revenue from the logistics industry, which currently has relatively lower gross margins. Operating expenses increased by 19% over 2017 due principally to the impact of headcount additions to support our future growth plans. Operating income decreased to 27% of revenue in 2018 from 34% of revenue in 2017, however net income increased to 27% of revenue in 2018 from 23% of revenue in 2017 due to a significantly lower effective tax rate. Income tax expense in 2017 included a one-time tra\nnsition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. Net income per diluted share increased to $1.24 in 2018 from $0.98 in 2017.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated financial data for continuing operations as a percentage of revenue:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research, development, and engineering expenses\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general, and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating income\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before income tax expense\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense on continuing operations\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs foreign currency exchange rates are a factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a constant-currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. We also use results on a constant-currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. Constant-currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant-currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Results on a constant-currency basis are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $806,338,000 compared to $766,083,000 for the prior year, representing an increase of $40,255,000, or 5%. Revenue in 2018 was impacted by lower sales in the consumer electronics industry primarily due to significantly lower revenue from a few large customers in OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display and smartphone manufacturing following a high level of investment from these customers in 2017. Excluding sales to customers in the consumer electronics industry, revenue increased by approximately 18% from the prior year, driven by growth in the logistics industry of over 50%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately 2% of the revenue increase from 2017 to 2018, primarily related to the translation of Euro-denominated and Chinese Yuan-denominated revenue to U.S. Dollars.\nRevenue from customers based in the Americas increased by 25% from the prior year driven by strong sales in the logistics industry. Revenue from customers based in Greater China increased by 16% from 2017, although this business was relatively flat in the fourth quarter of 2018 over the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenue from customers based in Europe decreased by 6% and revenue from customers based in other Asia regions decreased by 8% from the prior year. Revenue for both the Europe and Asia regions outside of Greater China was impacted by the lower sales in the consumer electronics industry noted above.\nAs of the date of this report, we expect revenue for the first quarter of 2019 to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition to the sequential decrease in revenue we typically experience in the first quarter as many manufacturing customers spend their capital budgets by the calendar year end, we are experiencing slower order trends in the automotive industry in the Americas and lower demand from customers based in Greater China.\nGross Margin\nGross margin as a percentage of revenue was 74.4% in 2018 compared to 75.6% in 2017. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a higher percentage of total revenue from the logistics industry. Certain sales in this industry are for application-specific customer solutions, which typically have lower gross margins due to deployment services. Unfavorable product mix for sales in the logistics industry also contributed to the lower gross margin percentage.\nThe Company's gross margin percentage has ranged in the mid 70s for the past several years. As of the date of this report, we expect the gross margin percentage for the first quarter of 2019 to continue to be within this historical range, but toward the lower end of this range due to anticipated unfavorable product mix toward sales in the logistics industry.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch, Development, and Engineering Expenses\nResearch, development, and engineering (RD&E) expenses in 2018 increased by $17,240,000, or 17%, from the prior year as detailed in the table below (in thousands).\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RD&E expenses in 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related costs\n</td> <td>10,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>3,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>3,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RD&E expenses in 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRD&E expenses increased due to higher personnel-related costs resulting primarily from headcount additions to support new product initiatives. Stock-based compensation expense was higher than the prior year due to a higher valuation of stock options granted, as well as a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate in 2018.\nRD&E expenses as a percentage of revenue were 14% in 2018 compared to 13% in 2017. We believe that a continued commitment to RD&E activities is essential in order to maintain or achieve a leadership position for our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, as well as to provide engineering support for strategic customers. In addition, we consider our ability to accelerate time to market for new products to be critical to our revenue growth. Therefore, we expect to continue to make significant RD&E investments in the future, and we target our annual RD&E spending to be between 10% and 15% of revenue. This percentage is impacted by revenue levels and investing cycles.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2018 increased by $41,971,000, or 19%, from the prior year as detailed in the table below (in thousands).\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses in 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related costs\n</td> <td>36,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>4,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation expense\n</td> <td>3,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive compensation plans\n</td> <td>(7,967\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>4,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses in 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSG&A expenses increased due to higher personnel-related costs resulting primarily from headcount additions, principally sales personnel. In addition to salaries and fringe benefits, these personnel-related costs included sales commissions and travel expenses related to the additional headcount. Stock-based compensation expense was higher than the prior year due to a higher valuation of stock options granted, as well as a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate in 2018. Depreciation expense increased from the prior year due primarily to information technology investments in infrastructure, security, and business applications, including a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that was placed into service in the middle of 2018. Offsetting these increases were lower expenses related to incentive compensation plans, including company bonuses and sales commissions, resulting from lower levels of achievement on performance plans that were set at the beginning of the year.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nThe Company recorded foreign currency losses of $1,064,000 in 2018 and $1,601,000 in 2017. The foreign currency gains and losses result primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany balances that are reported in one currency and collected or paid in another.\nInvestment income increased by $5,173,000, or 54%, from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher yields on the Company's portfolio of debt securities.\nThe Company recorded other expense of $219,000 in 2018 and $338,000 in 2017. Other income (expense) includes fair value adjustments of contingent consideration liabilities arising from business acquisitions, as well as rental income, net of associated expenses, from leasing space in buildings adjacent to the Company's corporate headquarters.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 7% of the Company's pre-tax income in 2018 compared to 34% in 2017.\nThe Tax Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) was signed into law. The Tax Act resulted in a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the reduction in anticipated tax rate, the Company remeasured its deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017 at the new enacted tax rate, and accordingly, recorded tax expense of $12,523,000 in 2017 from the associated write-down of its deferred tax assets. In 2018, the Company recorded an increase in tax expense of $3,240,000 from the write-down of its deferred tax assets primarily relating to guidance under the Tax Act regarding stock-based compensation.\nThe Tax Act subjects unrepatriated foreign earnings to a one-time transition tax, regardless of the Company's financial statement assertion related to indefinite reinvestment or whether the Company ultimately repatriates any of the foreign earnings, for which the Company recorded estimated tax expense of $101,379,000 in 2017. In 2018, the Company revised its estimate of the one-time transition tax and recorded a decrease in tax expense of $11,028,000, which resulted in a revised estimate for the one-time transition tax of $90,351,000 payable over eight years.\nThe Tax Act replaces the current system of taxing U.S. corporations on repatriated foreign earnings with a partial territorial system that provides a 100% dividends-received deduction to domestic corporations for foreign-source dividends received from 10% or more owned foreign corporations. The Company recorded a decrease in tax expense of $3,843,000 in 2017 from the reversal of the tax effect of a 2016 dividend paid in 2017 from a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary to its domestic entity.\nThe Company will continue to gather and analyze information on historical unrepatriated foreign earnings and monitor state laws relating to this income to finalize both the federal and state tax impact. The Tax Act limits certain deductions and these limitations may impact the value of existing deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to review the impact of these limitations as regulatory guidance is issued.\nOther Discrete Tax Items\nThe effective tax rate also included a decrease in tax expense of $8,488,000 in 2018, $38,569,000 in 2017, and $11,889,000 in 2016 from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises. The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods.\nIn 2018, tax expense included a provision for state income taxes of $620,000 from a change in management's financial statement assertion related to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. Management has determined that earnings from its legal entity in China will remain indefinitely reinvested to provide sufficient local funding for growth, and that earnings from all other jurisdictions will not be indefinitely reinvested resulting in the additional state income tax provision.\nOther discrete tax events resulted in a net decrease in tax expense of $2,467,000 in 2018 and a net decrease in tax expense of $2,502,000 in 2017, consisting primarily of i) the final true-up of the prior year's tax accrual upon filing the related tax returns and ii) the expiration of the statutes of limitations for certain reserves for income tax uncertainties.\nExcluding the impact of these discrete tax events, the Company's effective tax rate was 14% in 2018.\nThe Company is tax resident in numerous jurisdictions around the world and has identified its major tax jurisdictions as the United States, Ireland, and China. The statutory tax rate is 12.5% in Ireland and 25% in China, compared to the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate of 21%. International rights to certain of the Company's intellectual property are held by a subsidiary whose legal jurisdiction does not tax this income, resulting in a foreign effective tax rate lower than the above mentioned statutory rates.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $236,568,000, or 45%, from the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on revenue. Revenue increased by 32% in the Americas, 43% in Europe, and 63% in Asia due to a higher volume of machine vision products sold in all regions. Although the increase in revenue came from a variety of industries, strong sales in the logistics industry was a large\ncontributor to the growth in the Americas and strong sales in the consumer electronics industry was a large contributor to the growth in Europe and Asia.\nGross Margin\nGross margin as a percentage of revenue was 75.6% in 2017 compared to 75.2% in 2016. The increase in gross margin was due to the favorable impact of material cost reductions and volume purchasing, as well as manufacturing efficiencies achieved from a higher revenue level as fixed manufacturing costs were spread over a larger revenue base. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from a material customer in the consumer electronics industry under a preferred pricing arrangement, and to a lesser extent, an increased level of projects in the logistics industry that require installation services with lower margins.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch, Development, and Engineering Expenses\nResearch, development, and engineering (RD&E) expenses in 2017 increased by $20,936,000, or 27%, from the prior year as detailed in the table below (in thousands).\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RD&E expenses in 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related costs\n</td> <td>9,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>4,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outsourced engineering costs\n</td> <td>1,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>5,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RD&E expenses in 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRD&E expenses increased due to higher personnel-related costs resulting primarily from headcount additions, which included engineering talent from six business acquisitions completed since August 2016. The Company also incurred higher spending on outsourced engineering to support new product initiatives. Stock-based compensation expense was higher than the prior year due to a higher valuation of stock options granted early in 2017.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2017 increased by $54,618,000, or 33%, from the prior year as detailed in the table below (in thousands).\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses in 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related costs\n</td> <td>17,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive compensation plans\n</td> <td>10,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>5,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Travel expenses\n</td> <td>5,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ERP outside services\n</td> <td>3,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales demonstration equipment\n</td> <td>2,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recruiting costs\n</td> <td>2,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>6,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses in 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSG&A expenses increased due to higher personnel-related and recruiting costs resulting from headcount additions, principally sales personnel. In addition, higher incentive compensation plan expenses, including sales commission and Company bonus plans, were recorded in 2017 as a result of the additional headcount and higher achievement levels based upon the Company's performance. Travel expenses and sales demonstration equipment costs were also higher in 2017 due to additional sales personnel and the higher business level. Stock-based compensation expense was higher than the prior year due to a higher valuation of stock options granted early in 2017.\nIn 2017, the Company incurred costs for outside services related to the preliminary project and application development stages for a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, which is the management information system that integrates the Company's manufacturing, order fulfillment, and financial activities.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nThe Company recorded foreign currency losses of $1,601,000 in 2017 and foreign currency gains of $101,000 in 2016. The foreign currency losses in 2017 resulted primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable denominated in U.S. Dollars recorded on the books of the Company's Irish subsidiary, for which the functional currency\nis the Euro. During the period of time that these receivables were outstanding, the U.S. Dollar weakened versus the Euro resulting in foreign currency losses.\nInvestment income increased by $2,503,000, or 36%, from the prior year. The increase was due to higher yields, as well as additional funds available for investment on the Company's portfolio of debt securities.\nThe Company recorded other expense of $338,000 in 2017 and other income of $871,000 in 2016. Other income (expense) included a benefit of $28,000 in 2017 and a benefit of $463,000 in 2016 resulting from the revaluation of contingent consideration liabilities arising from business acquisitions. In addition, the Company received a foreign government subsidy in the amount of $422,000 that was recorded in other income in 2016. Other income (expense) also included rental income, net of associated expenses, from leasing space in buildings adjacent to the Company's corporate headquarters. Fewer tenants occupied this space in 2017, resulting in lower non-operating rental income.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 34% of the Company's pre-tax income in 2017 compared to 11% in 2016.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States Congress passed and the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act includes a number of changes that impact the Company's deferred tax positions, with the primary impact resulting from a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Company remeasured its deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017 at the new enacted tax rate, and accordingly, recorded tax expense of $12,523,000 from the write-down of deferred tax assets in 2017.\nIn addition, the Tax Act subjects unrepatriated foreign earnings to a one-time transition tax, regardless of the Company's financial statement assertion related to indefinite reinvestment or whether the Company ultimately repatriates any of the foreign earnings, for which the Company recorded estimated tax expense of $101,379,000 in 2017.\nFurthermore, the Tax Act replaces the current system of taxing U.S. corporations on repatriated foreign earnings with a partial territorial system that provides a 100% dividends-received deduction to domestic corporations for foreign-source dividends received from 10% or more owned foreign corporations. The Company recorded a decrease in tax expense of $3,843,000 in 2017 from the reversal of the tax effect of a 2016 dividend paid in 2017 from a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary to its domestic entity.\nIn addition to the 2017 impact of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate included a decrease in tax expense of $38,569,000 in 2017 and $11,889,000 in 2016 from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises. The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods.\nRemaining discrete tax events resulted in a decrease in tax expense of $2,502,000 in 2017, consisting primarily of the final true-up of the prior year's tax accrual upon filing the actual tax returns and the expiration of the statutes of limitations for certain reserves for income tax uncertainties, and an increase in tax expense of $475,000 in 2016.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company has historically been able to generate positive cash flow from operations, which has funded its operating activities and other cash requirements and has resulted in an accumulated cash and investment balance of $797,599,000 as of December 31, 2018. The Company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings, diversification, and maturities of its investments that maintain liquidity.\nThe Company's cash requirements in 2018 were primarily met with positive cash flows from operations. Cash requirements consisted of operating activities, the repurchase of common stock, the payment of dividends, and capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2018 totaled $37,095,000 and consisted primarily of computer hardware and software, manufacturing test equipment related to new product introductions, and improvements made to the Company's headquarters building in Natick, Massachusetts. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company placed into service a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system totaling $10,000,000 that is being depreciated over a ten year estimate useful life.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's material contractual obligations, both fixed and contingent (in thousands):\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>Inventory Purchase Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the obligations described above, the following items may also result in future material uses of cash:\nStock Repurchases\nIn April 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $100,000,000 of the Company's common stock. The Company repurchased 1,744,000 shares at a cost of $100,000,000 under this program, including 803,000 shares at a cost of $45,200,000 in the first quarter of 2018. In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $150,000,000 of the Company's common stock. The Company repurchased 3,174,000 shares at a cost of $150,000,000 under this program. In October 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $200,000,000 of the Company's common stock. As of December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 203,000 shares at a cost of $8,622,000 under this program, leaving a remaining balance of $191,378,000. Total stock repurchases in 2018 amounted to $203,822,000. The Company may repurchase shares under this program in future periods depending on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the impact of dilution from employee stock options, stock price, share availability, and cash requirements.\nDividends\nThe Company's Board of Directors declared and paid cash dividends of $0.045 per share in the first, second, and third quarters of 2018. The dividend was increased to $0.050 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Total dividends in 2018 amounted to $31,865,000. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board deems relevant, including, among other things, the Company's ability to generate positive cash flow from operations.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company's business strategy includes selective expansion into new machine vision markets and applications through the acquisition of businesses and technologies. Certain of the Company's business acquisitions have contractual obligations for deferred cash payments, contingent cash payments tied to performance, and special incentive cash payments tied to employment, none of which are material individually or in the aggregate to the Company's cash flows.\nThe Company believes that its existing cash and investment balances, together with cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet its operating, investing, and financing activities for the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $797,599,000 in cash and investments. In addition, Cognex has no long-term debt and does not anticipate needing debt financing in the near future. We believe that our strong cash position has put us in a relatively good position with respect to our longer-term liquidity needs.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or circumstances resulting in charges that could be material in future reporting periods. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d The core principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The framework in support of this core principle includes: (1) identifying the contract with the customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (5) recognizing revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied.\nIdentifying the Contract with the Customer\nThe Company identifies contracts with customers as agreements that create enforceable rights and obligations, which typically take the form of customer contracts or purchase orders.\nIdentifying the Performance Obligations in the Contract\nThe Company identifies performance obligations as promises in contracts to transfer distinct goods or services. Standard products and services that the Company regularly sells separately are accounted for as distinct performance obligations. Application-specific customer solutions that are comprised of a combination of products and services are accounted for as one performance obligation to deliver a total solution to the customer. On-site support services that are provided to the customer after the solution is deployed are accounted for as a separate performance obligation. These solutions are provided to customers in a variety of industries, including the consumer electronics, logistics, and automotive industries.\nShipping and handling activities for which the Company is responsible under the terms and conditions of the sale are not accounted for as performance obligations but as fulfillment costs. These activities are required to fulfill the Company's promise to transfer the goods and are expensed when revenue is recognized.\nThe Company does not assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract. If revenue is recognized before immaterial promises have been completed, then the costs related to such immaterial promises are accrued at the time of sale.\nDetermining the Transaction Price\nThe Company determines the transaction price as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer. Amounts collected from customers for sales taxes are excluded from the transaction price.\nIf a contract includes a variable amount, such as a rebate, then the Company estimates the transaction price using either the expected value or the most likely amount of consideration to be received, depending upon the specific facts and circumstances. The Company includes estimated variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. The Company updates its estimate of variable consideration at the end of each reporting period to reflect changes in facts and circumstances.\nAllocating the Transaction Price to the Performance Obligations\nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation at contract inception based on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, or the price at which the Company would sell the good or service separately to similar customers in similar circumstances.\nRecognizing Revenue When (or As) the Performance Obligations are Satisfied\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it transfers the promised goods or services to the customer. Revenue for standard products is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the goods, which is typically upon delivery when the customer has legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and an enforceable obligation to pay for the products. Revenue for services, which are not material, is typically recognized over the time the service is provided.\nRevenue for application-specific customer solutions is recognized at the point in time when the solution is validated, which is the point in time when the Company can objectively determine that the agreed-upon specifications in the contract have been met and the customer will accept the performance obligations in the arrangement. Although the customer may have taken legal title and physical possession of the goods when they arrived at the customer's designated site, the significant risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer only upon validation. Revenue for on-site support services related to these solutions is recognized over the time the service is provided.\nIn certain instances, an arrangement may include customer-specified acceptance provisions or performance guarantees that allow the customer to accept or reject delivered products that do not meet the customer's specifications. If the Company can objectively determine that control of a good or service has been transferred to the customer in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, then customer acceptance is a formality. If acceptance provisions are presumed to be substantive, then revenue is deferred until customer acceptance.\nFor the Company's standard products and services, revenue recognition and billing typically occur at the same time. For application-specific customer solutions, however, the agreement with the customer may provide for billing terms which differ from revenue recognition criteria, resulting in either deferred revenue or unbilled revenue. Credit assessments are performed to determine payment terms, which vary by region, industry, and customer. Prepayment terms result in contract liabilities for customer deposits. When credit is granted to customers, payment is typically due 30 to 90 days from billing. The Company's contracts have an original expected duration of less than one year, and therefore as a practical expedient, the Company has elected to ignore the impact of the time value of money on a contract and to expense sales commissions. The Company recognizes an asset for costs to fulfill a contract if the costs relate directly to the contract and to future performance, and the costs are expected to be recovered.\nManagement exercises judgment when determining the amount of revenue to be recognized each period. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, assessing the customer's ability and intention to pay substantially all of the contract consideration when due, determining when two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract, determining whether a contract modification has occurred, assessing whether promises are immaterial in the context of the contract, determining whether material promises in a contract represent distinct performance obligations, estimating the transaction price for a contract that contains variable consideration, determining the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation, determining whether control is transferred over time or at a point in time for performance obligations, and assessing whether formal customer acceptance provisions are substantive.\nInvestments\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company's investment portfolio of debt securities totaled $689,387,000. The debt securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in shareholders' equity as other comprehensive income (loss) since these securities are designated as available-for-sale securities. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's portfolio of debt securities had a net unrealized loss of $1,932,000. Included in this net loss were gross unrealized losses totaling $2,255,000, of which $1,445,000 were in a loss position for less than twelve months and $810,000 were in a loss position for greater than twelve months.\nThe Company applies a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements. The categorization of assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology utilize unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology are other observable inputs, including quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical and similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based upon management's best estimate of the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk. Changes in the valuation methodology, interest rates, credit rates, or the market for these investments could result in changes to their fair values. Changes to the Level of an investment within the fair value hierarchy are determined at the end of the reporting period.\nThe Company's debt securities are reported at fair value based upon model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term\nof the asset, and are therefore classified as Level 2. Management is responsible for estimating the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities, and in doing so, considers valuations provided by a large, third-party pricing service. This service maintains regular contact with market makers, brokers, dealers, and analysts to gather information on market movement, direction, trends, and other specific data. They use this information to structure yield curves for various types of debt securities and arrive at the daily valuations.\nManagement monitors the carrying value of its debt securities compared to their fair value to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. In considering whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, we consider many factors, both qualitative and quantitative in nature, including the type of security, the credit rating of the security, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the size of the loss position, our ability and intent to hold the security to expected recovery of value, and other meaningful information. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded in current operations to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its fair value. There were no other-than-temporary impairments of investments in 2018, 2017, or 2016.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company maintains reserves against its accounts receivable for potential credit losses. Ongoing credit evaluations of customers are performed and the Company has historically not experienced significant losses related to the collection of its accounts receivable. Allowances for specific accounts determined to be at risk for collection are estimated by management taking into account the length of time the receivable has been outstanding, the customer's current ability to pay its obligations to the Company, general economic and industry conditions, as well as various other factors. Global economic uncertainty may result in longer payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable balances, which make these estimates more judgmental. An adverse change in any of these factors could result in higher than expected customer defaults and may result in the need for additional bad debt provisions. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's reserve against accounts receivable was $1,646,000, or 1% of the gross accounts receivable balance. A 10% difference in the reserve against accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018 would have affected net income by approximately $141,000.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less readily predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Management estimates excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand, product transitions, and market conditions, and records reserves to reduce the carrying value of inventories to their net realizable value. Volatility in the global economy makes these assumptions about future demand more judgmental. Among the risks associated with the introduction of new products are difficulty predicting customer demand and effectively managing inventory levels to ensure adequate supply of the new product and avoid excess supply of the legacy product. In addition, we may strategically enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors to purchase materials for products in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or address concerns about the availability of future supplies and long lead times. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's reserve for excess and obsolete inventory totaled $4,684,000, or 5% of the gross inventory balance. A 10% difference in inventory reserves as of December 31, 2018 would have affected net income by approximately $402,000.\nLong-lived Assets\nThe Company has long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment and acquired intangible assets. These assets are susceptible to shortened estimated useful lives and changes in fair value due to changes in their use, market or economic changes, or other events or circumstances. The Company evaluates the potential impairment of these long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include historical or projected results that are less than the assumptions used in the original valuation of an acquired asset, a change in the Company's business strategy or its use of an acquired asset, or negative economic or industry trends.\nIf an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability of the assets by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company compares the fair value of the long-lived assets to the carrying value and records an impairment loss for the difference. The Company generally estimates the fair value of its long-lived assets using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues and expenses, discount factors, income tax rates, the identification of groups of assets with highly independent cash flows, and assets' economic lives. Volatility in the global economy makes these assumptions and estimates more judgmental. In 2017, the Company determined that the carrying value of the customer relationship\ns arising from the AQSense acquisition was impaired and reduced this value to zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $469,000. The Company did not record an impairment charge related to long-lived assets in 2018 or 2016. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from those used in assessing the recoverability of these assets and could result in an impairment of long-lived assets in future periods.\nInternal-use Software\nThe accounting treatment for computer software developed for internal use depends upon the nature of activities performed at each stage of development. The preliminary project stage includes conceptual formulation of design alternatives, determination of system requirements, vendor demonstrations, and final selection of vendors, and during this stage costs are expensed as incurred. The application development stage includes software configuration, coding, hardware installation, and testing. During this stage, certain costs are capitalized, including external direct costs of materials and services, as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with the project, while certain costs are expensed as incurred, including training and data conversion costs. The post-implementation stage includes support and maintenance, and during this stage costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalization begins when both the preliminary project stage is completed and management commits to funding the project. Capitalization ceases at the point the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, that is, after all substantial testing is completed. The application of these rules requires the use of judgment to determine when the project has reached the next stage of development, which costs are directly associated with the project, and when the asset is ready for its intended use.\nGoodwill\nManagement evaluates the potential impairment of goodwill annually each fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The Company currently operates under one reporting unit which is the level at which the goodwill impairment analysis is performed. Determining the Company's reporting units requires judgments regarding what constitutes a business and at what level discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management.\nThe Company performs a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. Under this quantitative analysis, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the Company recognizes an impairment charge. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model. In addition, the Company uses the market approach, which compares the reporting unit to publicly-traded companies and transactions involving similar businesses, to support the conclusions based upon the income approach. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues, expenses, capital expenditures, and working capital, as well as discount factors and income tax rates.\nFactors that management considered in the qualitative assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance (both current and projected), changes in management or strategy, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets, and market capitalization. Based on the qualitative assessment, management does not believe that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value. No impairment losses were recorded in 2018, 2017, or 2016.\nWarranty Obligations\nThe Company records the estimated cost of fulfilling product warranties at the time of sale based upon historical costs to fulfill claims. Obligations may also be recorded subsequent to the time of sale whenever specific events or circumstances impacting product quality become known that would not have been taken into account using historical data. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers and third-party contract manufacturers, the Company's warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage, and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. An adverse change in any of these factors may result in the need for additional warranty provisions. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's accrued warranty obligations amounted to $4,743,000. A 10% difference in accrued warranty obligations as of December 31, 2018 would have affected net income by approximately $407,000.\nContingencies\nEstimated losses from contingencies are accrued by management based upon whether a loss is probable and whether management has the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. Estimating potential losses, or even a range of losses, is difficult and involves a great deal of judgment. Management relies primarily on assessments made by its internal and external legal counsel to make the determination as to whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be recorded or disclosed. This analysis is performed each reporting period or when facts and circumstances dictate. Should the resolution of a contingency result in a loss that we did not accrue because management did not believe that the loss was probable or capable of being reasonably estimated, then this loss would result in a charge to income in the period the contingency was resolved. The Company did not have any significant accrued contingencies as of December 31, 2018.\nDerivative Instruments\nIn certain instances, the Company enters into forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations. The Company's forward contracts are reported at fair value based upon model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, and are therefore classified as Level 2. The Company's forward contracts are typically traded or executed in over-the-counter markets with a relatively high degree of pricing transparency. The market participants are generally large commercial banks.\nThe Company enters into two types of hedges to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. The first are economic hedges which utilize foreign currency forward contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising primarily from foreign-denominated receivables and payables. The gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to be offset by the changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities being hedged. These economic hedges are not designated as effective hedges, and therefore, do not qualify for effective hedge accounting. The second are cash flow hedges which utilize foreign currency forward contracts to protect our budgeted revenues and expenses against foreign currency exchange rate changes compared to our budgeted rates. These cash flow hedges are designated for hedge accounting, and therefore, the effective portion of the forward contract's gain or loss is reported in shareholders' equity as other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into current operations as the hedged transaction impacts current operations. Should these hedges fail to qualify for hedge accounting or be ineffective, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be reported in current operations immediately as opposed to when the hedged transaction impacts current operations. This may result in material foreign currency gains or losses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense is recognized for all stock option and restricted stock grants. Determining the appropriate valuation model and estimating the fair values of these grants requires the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, dividend yields, expected term, and forfeiture rates. The expected volatility assumption is based partially upon the historical volatility of the Company's common stock, which may or may not be a true indicator of future volatility, particularly as the Company continues to seek to diversify its customer base. The assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stock option grants represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company recorded in the current period.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining worldwide income tax expense based upon tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company has established reserves for income taxes by applying the more likely than not\u201d criteria, under which the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authority. All tax positions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification, such as the completion of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations, which may result in future charges or credits to income tax expense.\nAs part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. This process involves estimating the current tax liability, as well as assessing temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for financial statement and tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) was signed into law. The Tax Act resulted in a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the reduction in anticipated tax rate, the Company remeasured its deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017 at the new enacted tax rate, and accordingly, recorded tax expense of $12,523,000 in 2017 from the associated write-down of its deferred tax assets. In 2018, the Company recorded an increase in tax expense of $3,240,000 from the write-down of its deferred tax assets primarily relating to guidance under the Tax Act regarding stock-based compensation.\nThe Tax Act subjects unrepatriated foreign earnings to a one-time transition tax, regardless of the Company's financial statement assertion related to indefinite reinvestment or whether the Company ultimately repatriates any of the foreign earnings, for which the Company recorded estimated tax expense of $101,379,000 in 2017. In 2018, the Company revised its estimate of the one-time transition tax and recorded a decrease in tax expense of $11,028,000, which resulted in revised estimate for the one-time transition tax of $90,351,000 payable over eight years.\nThe Company will continue to gather and analyze information on historical unrepatriated foreign earnings and monitor state laws relating to this income to finalize both the federal and state tax impact. The Tax Act limits certain deductions and these limitations may impact the value of existing deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to review the impact of these limitations as regulatory guidance is issued.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Determining what constitutes a business to qualify as a business combination requires some judgment. Allocating the purchase price requires the Company to identify and estimate the fair values of various assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Management is responsible for determining the appropriate valuation model and estimated fair values, and in doing so, considers a number of factors, including information provided by an outside valuation advisor. Management primarily establishes fair value using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues and expenses, as well as discount factors. Contingent consideration liabilities are reported at their estimated fair values based upon probability-adjusted present values of the consideration expected to be paid, using significant inputs and estimates. Key assumptions used in these estimates include probability assessments with respect to the likelihood of achieving certain milestones and discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achievement. The fair value of these contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured each reporting period, with changes in the fair value recorded in \"Other income (expense)\" on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The remeasured liability amount could be significantly different from the amount at the acquisition date, resulting in material charges or credits in future reporting periods.\nNEW

In addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision products, the Company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support, consulting, and training services to its customers; however, service revenue accounted for less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.\nCognex machine vision is primarily used to automate manufacturing and distribution processes in a variety of industries, where the technology is widely recognized as an important component of automated production and quality assurance. Virtually every manufacturer can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, Cognex products are used by a broad base of customers across a variety of industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. Cognex products are also used outside of the manufacturing sector to automate distribution processes in the logistics industry for applications in retail distribution and ecommerce to scan, track, and sort goods through distribution centers.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" using the full retrospective method to present all periods reported on a consistent basis. Accordingly, prior period revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit have been restated to apply the provisions of this ASC.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $806,338,000, representing an increase of 5% over 2017. Lower revenue from customers in the consumer electronics industry was offset by higher revenue across a variety of other industries, including the logistics and automotive industries. Gross margin was 74.4% of revenue in 2018 compared to 75.6% of revenue in 2017 due primarily to a higher percentage of total revenue from the logistics industry, which currently has relatively lower gross margins. Operating expenses increased by 19% over 2017 due principally to the impact of headcount additions to support our future growth plans. Operating income decreased to 27% of revenue in 2018 from 34% of revenue in 2017, however net income increased to 27% of revenue in 2018 from 23% of revenue in 2017 due to a significantly lower effective tax rate. Income tax expense in 2017 included a one-time tra\nnsition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. Net income per diluted share increased to $1.24 in 2018 from $0.98 in 2017.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated financial data for continuing operations as a percentage of revenue:\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs foreign currency exchange rates are a factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a constant-currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. We also use results on a constant-currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. Constant-currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant-currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Results on a constant-currency basis are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $806,338,000 compared to $766,083,000 for the prior year, representing an increase of $40,255,000, or 5%. Revenue in 2018 was impacted by lower sales in the consumer electronics industry primarily due to significantly lower revenue from a few large customers in OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display and smartphone manufacturing following a high level of investment from these customers in 2017. Excluding sales to customers in the consumer electronics industry, revenue increased by approximately 18% from the prior year, driven by growth in the logistics industry of over 50%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately 2% of the revenue increase from 2017 to 2018, primarily related to the translation of Euro-denominated and Chinese Yuan-denominated revenue to U.S. Dollars.\nRevenue from customers based in the Americas increased by 25% from the prior year driven by strong sales in the logistics industry. Revenue from customers based in Greater China increased by 16% from 2017, although this business was relatively flat in the fourth quarter of 2018 over the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenue from customers based in Europe decreased by 6% and revenue from customers based in other Asia regions decreased by 8% from the prior year. Revenue for both the Europe and Asia regions outside of Greater China was impacted by the lower sales in the consumer electronics industry noted above.\nAs of the date of this report, we expect revenue for the first quarter of 2019 to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition to the sequential decrease in revenue we typically experience in the first quarter as many manufacturing customers spend their capital budgets by the calendar year end, we are experiencing slower order trends in the automotive industry in the Americas and lower demand from customers based in Greater China.\nGross Margin\nGross margin as a percentage of revenue was 74.4% in 2018 compared to 75.6% in 2017. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a higher percentage of total revenue from the logistics industry. Certain sales in this industry are for application-specific customer solutions, which typically have lower gross margins due to deployment services. Unfavorable product mix for sales in the logistics industry also contributed to the lower gross margin percentage.\nThe Company's gross margin percentage has ranged in the mid 70s for the past several years. As of the date of this report, we expect the gross margin percentage for the first quarter of 2019 to continue to be within this historical range, but toward the lower end of this range due to anticipated unfavorable product mix toward sales in the logistics industry.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch, Development, and Engineering Expenses\nResearch, development, and engineering (RD&E) expenses in 2018 increased by $17,240,000, or 17%, from the prior year as detailed in the table below (in thousands).\n\nRD&E expenses increased due to higher personnel-related costs resulting primarily from headcount additions to support new product initiatives. Stock-based compensation expense was higher than the prior year due to a higher valuation of stock options granted, as well as a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate in 2018.\nRD&E expenses as a percentage of revenue were 14% in 2018 compared to 13% in 2017. We believe that a continued commitment to RD&E activities is essential in order to maintain or achieve a leadership position for our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, as well as to provide engineering support for strategic customers. In addition, we consider our ability to accelerate time to market for new products to be critical to our revenue growth. Therefore, we expect to continue to make significant RD&E investments in the future, and we target our annual RD&E spending to be between 10% and 15% of revenue. This percentage is impacted by revenue levels and investing cycles.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2018 increased by $41,971,000, or 19%, from the prior year as detailed in the table below (in thousands).\n\nSG&A expenses increased due to higher personnel-related costs resulting primarily from headcount additions, principally sales personnel. In addition to salaries and fringe benefits, these personnel-related costs included sales commissions and travel expenses related to the additional headcount. Stock-based compensation expense was higher than the prior year due to a higher valuation of stock options granted, as well as a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate in 2018. Depreciation expense increased from the prior year due primarily to information technology investments in infrastructure, security, and business applications, including a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that was placed into service in the middle of 2018. Offsetting these increases were lower expenses related to incentive compensation plans, including company bonuses and sales commissions, resulting from lower levels of achievement on performance plans that were set at the beginning of the year.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nThe Company recorded foreign currency losses of $1,064,000 in 2018 and $1,601,000 in 2017. The foreign currency gains and losses result primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany balances that are reported in one currency and collected or paid in another.\nInvestment income increased by $5,173,000, or 54%, from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher yields on the Company's portfolio of debt securities.\nThe Company recorded other expense of $219,000 in 2018 and $338,000 in 2017. Other income (expense) includes fair value adjustments of contingent consideration liabilities arising from business acquisitions, as well as rental income, net of associated expenses, from leasing space in buildings adjacent to the Company's corporate headquarters.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 7% of the Company's pre-tax income in 2018 compared to 34% in 2017.\nThe Tax Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) was signed into law. The Tax Act resulted in a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the reduction in anticipated tax rate, the Company remeasured its deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017 at the new enacted tax rate, and accordingly, recorded tax expense of $12,523,000 in 2017 from the associated write-down of its deferred tax assets. In 2018, the Company recorded an increase in tax expense of $3,240,000 from the write-down of its deferred tax assets primarily relating to guidance under the Tax Act regarding stock-based compensation.\nThe Tax Act subjects unrepatriated foreign earnings to a one-time transition tax, regardless of the Company's financial statement assertion related to indefinite reinvestment or whether the Company ultimately repatriates any of the foreign earnings, for which the Company recorded estimated tax expense of $101,379,000 in 2017. In 2018, the Company revised its estimate of the one-time transition tax and recorded a decrease in tax expense of $11,028,000, which resulted in a revised estimate for the one-time transition tax of $90,351,000 payable over eight years.\nThe Tax Act replaces the current system of taxing U.S. corporations on repatriated foreign earnings with a partial territorial system that provides a 100% dividends-received deduction to domestic corporations for foreign-source dividends received from 10% or more owned foreign corporations. The Company recorded a decrease in tax expense of $3,843,000 in 2017 from the reversal of the tax effect of a 2016 dividend paid in 2017 from a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary to its domestic entity.\nThe Company will continue to gather and analyze information on historical unrepatriated foreign earnings and monitor state laws relating to this income to finalize both the federal and state tax impact. The Tax Act limits certain deductions and these limitations may impact the value of existing deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to review the impact of these limitations as regulatory guidance is issued.\nOther Discrete Tax Items\nThe effective tax rate also included a decrease in tax expense of $8,488,000 in 2018, $38,569,000 in 2017, and $11,889,000 in 2016 from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises. The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods.\nIn 2018, tax expense included a provision for state income taxes of $620,000 from a change in management's financial statement assertion related to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. Management has determined that earnings from its legal entity in China will remain indefinitely reinvested to provide sufficient local funding for growth, and that earnings from all other jurisdictions will not be indefinitely reinvested resulting in the additional state income tax provision.\nOther discrete tax events resulted in a net decrease in tax expense of $2,467,000 in 2018 and a net decrease in tax expense of $2,502,000 in 2017, consisting primarily of i) the final true-up of the prior year's tax accrual upon filing the related tax returns and ii) the expiration of the statutes of limitations for certain reserves for income tax uncertainties.\nExcluding the impact of these discrete tax events, the Company's effective tax rate was 14% in 2018.\nThe Company is tax resident in numerous jurisdictions around the world and has identified its major tax jurisdictions as the United States, Ireland, and China. The statutory tax rate is 12.5% in Ireland and 25% in China, compared to the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate of 21%. International rights to certain of the Company's intellectual property are held by a subsidiary whose legal jurisdiction does not tax this income, resulting in a foreign effective tax rate lower than the above mentioned statutory rates.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $236,568,000, or 45%, from the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on revenue. Revenue increased by 32% in the Americas, 43% in Europe, and 63% in Asia due to a higher volume of machine vision products sold in all regions. Although the increase in revenue came from a variety of industries, strong sales in the logistics industry was a large\ncontributor to the growth in the Americas and strong sales in the consumer electronics industry was a large contributor to the growth in Europe and Asia.\nGross Margin\nGross margin as a percentage of revenue was 75.6% in 2017 compared to 75.2% in 2016. The increase in gross margin was due to the favorable impact of material cost reductions and volume purchasing, as well as manufacturing efficiencies achieved from a higher revenue level as fixed manufacturing costs were spread over a larger revenue base. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from a material customer in the consumer electronics industry under a preferred pricing arrangement, and to a lesser extent, an increased level of projects in the logistics industry that require installation services with lower margins.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch, Development, and Engineering Expenses\nResearch, development, and engineering (RD&E) expenses in 2017 increased by $20,936,000, or 27%, from the prior year as detailed in the table below (in thousands).\n\nRD&E expenses increased due to higher personnel-related costs resulting primarily from headcount additions, which included engineering talent from six business acquisitions completed since August 2016. The Company also incurred higher spending on outsourced engineering to support new product initiatives. Stock-based compensation expense was higher than the prior year due to a higher valuation of stock options granted early in 2017.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2017 increased by $54,618,000, or 33%, from the prior year as detailed in the table below (in thousands).\n\nSG&A expenses increased due to higher personnel-related and recruiting costs resulting from headcount additions, principally sales personnel. In addition, higher incentive compensation plan expenses, including sales commission and Company bonus plans, were recorded in 2017 as a result of the additional headcount and higher achievement levels based upon the Company's performance. Travel expenses and sales demonstration equipment costs were also higher in 2017 due to additional sales personnel and the higher business level. Stock-based compensation expense was higher than the prior year due to a higher valuation of stock options granted early in 2017.\nIn 2017, the Company incurred costs for outside services related to the preliminary project and application development stages for a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, which is the management information system that integrates the Company's manufacturing, order fulfillment, and financial activities.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nThe Company recorded foreign currency losses of $1,601,000 in 2017 and foreign currency gains of $101,000 in 2016. The foreign currency losses in 2017 resulted primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable denominated in U.S. Dollars recorded on the books of the Company's Irish subsidiary, for which the functional currency\nis the Euro. During the period of time that these receivables were outstanding, the U.S. Dollar weakened versus the Euro resulting in foreign currency losses.\nInvestment income increased by $2,503,000, or 36%, from the prior year. The increase was due to higher yields, as well as additional funds available for investment on the Company's portfolio of debt securities.\nThe Company recorded other expense of $338,000 in 2017 and other income of $871,000 in 2016. Other income (expense) included a benefit of $28,000 in 2017 and a benefit of $463,000 in 2016 resulting from the revaluation of contingent consideration liabilities arising from business acquisitions. In addition, the Company received a foreign government subsidy in the amount of $422,000 that was recorded in other income in 2016. Other income (expense) also included rental income, net of associated expenses, from leasing space in buildings adjacent to the Company's corporate headquarters. Fewer tenants occupied this space in 2017, resulting in lower non-operating rental income.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 34% of the Company's pre-tax income in 2017 compared to 11% in 2016.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States Congress passed and the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act includes a number of changes that impact the Company's deferred tax positions, with the primary impact resulting from a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Company remeasured its deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017 at the new enacted tax rate, and accordingly, recorded tax expense of $12,523,000 from the write-down of deferred tax assets in 2017.\nIn addition, the Tax Act subjects unrepatriated foreign earnings to a one-time transition tax, regardless of the Company's financial statement assertion related to indefinite reinvestment or whether the Company ultimately repatriates any of the foreign earnings, for which the Company recorded estimated tax expense of $101,379,000 in 2017.\nFurthermore, the Tax Act replaces the current system of taxing U.S. corporations on repatriated foreign earnings with a partial territorial system that provides a 100% dividends-received deduction to domestic corporations for foreign-source dividends received from 10% or more owned foreign corporations. The Company recorded a decrease in tax expense of $3,843,000 in 2017 from the reversal of the tax effect of a 2016 dividend paid in 2017 from a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary to its domestic entity.\nIn addition to the 2017 impact of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate included a decrease in tax expense of $38,569,000 in 2017 and $11,889,000 in 2016 from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises. The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods.\nRemaining discrete tax events resulted in a decrease in tax expense of $2,502,000 in 2017, consisting primarily of the final true-up of the prior year's tax accrual upon filing the actual tax returns and the expiration of the statutes of limitations for certain reserves for income tax uncertainties, and an increase in tax expense of $475,000 in 2016.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company has historically been able to generate positive cash flow from operations, which has funded its operating activities and other cash requirements and has resulted in an accumulated cash and investment balance of $797,599,000 as of December 31, 2018. The Company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings, diversification, and maturities of its investments that maintain liquidity.\nThe Company's cash requirements in 2018 were primarily met with positive cash flows from operations. Cash requirements consisted of operating activities, the repurchase of common stock, the payment of dividends, and capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2018 totaled $37,095,000 and consisted primarily of computer hardware and software, manufacturing test equipment related to new product introductions, and improvements made to the Company's headquarters building in Natick, Massachusetts. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company placed into service a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system totaling $10,000,000 that is being depreciated over a ten year estimate useful life.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's material contractual obligations, both fixed and contingent (in thousands):\n\nIn addition to the obligations described above, the following items may also result in future material uses of cash:\nStock Repurchases\nIn April 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $100,000,000 of the Company's common stock. The Company repurchased 1,744,000 shares at a cost of $100,000,000 under this program, including 803,000 shares at a cost of $45,200,000 in the first quarter of 2018. In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $150,000,000 of the Company's common stock. The Company repurchased 3,174,000 shares at a cost of $150,000,000 under this program. In October 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $200,000,000 of the Company's common stock. As of December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 203,000 shares at a cost of $8,622,000 under this program, leaving a remaining balance of $191,378,000. Total stock repurchases in 2018 amounted to $203,822,000. The Company may repurchase shares under this program in future periods depending on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the impact of dilution from employee stock options, stock price, share availability, and cash requirements.\nDividends\nThe Company's Board of Directors declared and paid cash dividends of $0.045 per share in the first, second, and third quarters of 2018. The dividend was increased to $0.050 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Total dividends in 2018 amounted to $31,865,000. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board deems relevant, including, among other things, the Company's ability to generate positive cash flow from operations.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company's business strategy includes selective expansion into new machine vision markets and applications through the acquisition of businesses and technologies. Certain of the Company's business acquisitions have contractual obligations for deferred cash payments, contingent cash payments tied to performance, and special incentive cash payments tied to employment, none of which are material individually or in the aggregate to the Company's cash flows.\nThe Company believes that its existing cash and investment balances, together with cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet its operating, investing, and financing activities for the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $797,599,000 in cash and investments. In addition, Cognex has no long-term debt and does not anticipate needing debt financing in the near future. We believe that our strong cash position has put us in a relatively good position with respect to our longer-term liquidity needs.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or circumstances resulting in charges that could be material in future reporting periods. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d The core principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The framework in support of this core principle includes: (1) identifying the contract with the customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (5) recognizing revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied.\nIdentifying the Contract with the Customer\nThe Company identifies contracts with customers as agreements that create enforceable rights and obligations, which typically take the form of customer contracts or purchase orders.\nIdentifying the Performance Obligations in the Contract\nThe Company identifies performance obligations as promises in contracts to transfer distinct goods or services. Standard products and services that the Company regularly sells separately are accounted for as distinct performance obligations. Application-specific customer solutions that are comprised of a combination of products and services are accounted for as one performance obligation to deliver a total solution to the customer. On-site support services that are provided to the customer after the solution is deployed are accounted for as a separate performance obligation. These solutions are provided to customers in a variety of industries, including the consumer electronics, logistics, and automotive industries.\nShipping and handling activities for which the Company is responsible under the terms and conditions of the sale are not accounted for as performance obligations but as fulfillment costs. These activities are required to fulfill the Company's promise to transfer the goods and are expensed when revenue is recognized.\nThe Company does not assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract. If revenue is recognized before immaterial promises have been completed, then the costs related to such immaterial promises are accrued at the time of sale.\nDetermining the Transaction Price\nThe Company determines the transaction price as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer. Amounts collected from customers for sales taxes are excluded from the transaction price.\nIf a contract includes a variable amount, such as a rebate, then the Company estimates the transaction price using either the expected value or the most likely amount of consideration to be received, depending upon the specific facts and circumstances. The Company includes estimated variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. The Company updates its estimate of variable consideration at the end of each reporting period to reflect changes in facts and circumstances.\nAllocating the Transaction Price to the Performance Obligations\nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation at contract inception based on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, or the price at which the Company would sell the good or service separately to similar customers in similar circumstances.\nRecognizing Revenue When (or As) the Performance Obligations are Satisfied\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it transfers the promised goods or services to the customer. Revenue for standard products is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the goods, which is typically upon delivery when the customer has legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and an enforceable obligation to pay for the products. Revenue for services, which are not material, is typically recognized over the time the service is provided.\nRevenue for application-specific customer solutions is recognized at the point in time when the solution is validated, which is the point in time when the Company can objectively determine that the agreed-upon specifications in the contract have been met and the customer will accept the performance obligations in the arrangement. Although the customer may have taken legal title and physical possession of the goods when they arrived at the customer's designated site, the significant risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer only upon validation. Revenue for on-site support services related to these solutions is recognized over the time the service is provided.\nIn certain instances, an arrangement may include customer-specified acceptance provisions or performance guarantees that allow the customer to accept or reject delivered products that do not meet the customer's specifications. If the Company can objectively determine that control of a good or service has been transferred to the customer in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, then customer acceptance is a formality. If acceptance provisions are presumed to be substantive, then revenue is deferred until customer acceptance.\nFor the Company's standard products and services, revenue recognition and billing typically occur at the same time. For application-specific customer solutions, however, the agreement with the customer may provide for billing terms which differ from revenue recognition criteria, resulting in either deferred revenue or unbilled revenue. Credit assessments are performed to determine payment terms, which vary by region, industry, and customer. Prepayment terms result in contract liabilities for customer deposits. When credit is granted to customers, payment is typically due 30 to 90 days from billing. The Company's contracts have an original expected duration of less than one year, and therefore as a practical expedient, the Company has elected to ignore the impact of the time value of money on a contract and to expense sales commissions. The Company recognizes an asset for costs to fulfill a contract if the costs relate directly to the contract and to future performance, and the costs are expected to be recovered.\nManagement exercises judgment when determining the amount of revenue to be recognized each period. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, assessing the customer's ability and intention to pay substantially all of the contract consideration when due, determining when two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract, determining whether a contract modification has occurred, assessing whether promises are immaterial in the context of the contract, determining whether material promises in a contract represent distinct performance obligations, estimating the transaction price for a contract that contains variable consideration, determining the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation, determining whether control is transferred over time or at a point in time for performance obligations, and assessing whether formal customer acceptance provisions are substantive.\nInvestments\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company's investment portfolio of debt securities totaled $689,387,000. The debt securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in shareholders' equity as other comprehensive income (loss) since these securities are designated as available-for-sale securities. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's portfolio of debt securities had a net unrealized loss of $1,932,000. Included in this net loss were gross unrealized losses totaling $2,255,000, of which $1,445,000 were in a loss position for less than twelve months and $810,000 were in a loss position for greater than twelve months.\nThe Company applies a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements. The categorization of assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology utilize unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology are other observable inputs, including quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical and similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based upon management's best estimate of the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk. Changes in the valuation methodology, interest rates, credit rates, or the market for these investments could result in changes to their fair values. Changes to the Level of an investment within the fair value hierarchy are determined at the end of the reporting period.\nThe Company's debt securities are reported at fair value based upon model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term\nof the asset, and are therefore classified as Level 2. Management is responsible for estimating the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities, and in doing so, considers valuations provided by a large, third-party pricing service. This service maintains regular contact with market makers, brokers, dealers, and analysts to gather information on market movement, direction, trends, and other specific data. They use this information to structure yield curves for various types of debt securities and arrive at the daily valuations.\nManagement monitors the carrying value of its debt securities compared to their fair value to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. In considering whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, we consider many factors, both qualitative and quantitative in nature, including the type of security, the credit rating of the security, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the size of the loss position, our ability and intent to hold the security to expected recovery of value, and other meaningful information. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded in current operations to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its fair value. There were no other-than-temporary impairments of investments in 2018, 2017, or 2016.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company maintains reserves against its accounts receivable for potential credit losses. Ongoing credit evaluations of customers are performed and the Company has historically not experienced significant losses related to the collection of its accounts receivable. Allowances for specific accounts determined to be at risk for collection are estimated by management taking into account the length of time the receivable has been outstanding, the customer's current ability to pay its obligations to the Company, general economic and industry conditions, as well as various other factors. Global economic uncertainty may result in longer payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable balances, which make these estimates more judgmental. An adverse change in any of these factors could result in higher than expected customer defaults and may result in the need for additional bad debt provisions. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's reserve against accounts receivable was $1,646,000, or 1% of the gross accounts receivable balance. A 10% difference in the reserve against accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018 would have affected net income by approximately $141,000.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less readily predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Management estimates excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand, product transitions, and market conditions, and records reserves to reduce the carrying value of inventories to their net realizable value. Volatility in the global economy makes these assumptions about future demand more judgmental. Among the risks associated with the introduction of new products are difficulty predicting customer demand and effectively managing inventory levels to ensure adequate supply of the new product and avoid excess supply of the legacy product. In addition, we may strategically enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors to purchase materials for products in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or address concerns about the availability of future supplies and long lead times. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's reserve for excess and obsolete inventory totaled $4,684,000, or 5% of the gross inventory balance. A 10% difference in inventory reserves as of December 31, 2018 would have affected net income by approximately $402,000.\nLong-lived Assets\nThe Company has long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment and acquired intangible assets. These assets are susceptible to shortened estimated useful lives and changes in fair value due to changes in their use, market or economic changes, or other events or circumstances. The Company evaluates the potential impairment of these long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include historical or projected results that are less than the assumptions used in the original valuation of an acquired asset, a change in the Company's business strategy or its use of an acquired asset, or negative economic or industry trends.\nIf an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability of the assets by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company compares the fair value of the long-lived assets to the carrying value and records an impairment loss for the difference. The Company generally estimates the fair value of its long-lived assets using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues and expenses, discount factors, income tax rates, the identification of groups of assets with highly independent cash flows, and assets' economic lives. Volatility in the global economy makes these assumptions and estimates more judgmental. In 2017, the Company determined that the carrying value of the customer relationship\ns arising from the AQSense acquisition was impaired and reduced this value to zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $469,000. The Company did not record an impairment charge related to long-lived assets in 2018 or 2016. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from those used in assessing the recoverability of these assets and could result in an impairment of long-lived assets in future periods.\nInternal-use Software\nThe accounting treatment for computer software developed for internal use depends upon the nature of activities performed at each stage of development. The preliminary project stage includes conceptual formulation of design alternatives, determination of system requirements, vendor demonstrations, and final selection of vendors, and during this stage costs are expensed as incurred. The application development stage includes software configuration, coding, hardware installation, and testing. During this stage, certain costs are capitalized, including external direct costs of materials and services, as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with the project, while certain costs are expensed as incurred, including training and data conversion costs. The post-implementation stage includes support and maintenance, and during this stage costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalization begins when both the preliminary project stage is completed and management commits to funding the project. Capitalization ceases at the point the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, that is, after all substantial testing is completed. The application of these rules requires the use of judgment to determine when the project has reached the next stage of development, which costs are directly associated with the project, and when the asset is ready for its intended use.\nGoodwill\nManagement evaluates the potential impairment of goodwill annually each fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The Company currently operates under one reporting unit which is the level at which the goodwill impairment analysis is performed. Determining the Company's reporting units requires judgments regarding what constitutes a business and at what level discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management.\nThe Company performs a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. Under this quantitative analysis, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the Company recognizes an impairment charge. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model. In addition, the Company uses the market approach, which compares the reporting unit to publicly-traded companies and transactions involving similar businesses, to support the conclusions based upon the income approach. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues, expenses, capital expenditures, and working capital, as well as discount factors and income tax rates.\nFactors that management considered in the qualitative assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance (both current and projected), changes in management or strategy, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets, and market capitalization. Based on the qualitative assessment, management does not believe that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value. No impairment losses were recorded in 2018, 2017, or 2016.\nWarranty Obligations\nThe Company records the estimated cost of fulfilling product warranties at the time of sale based upon historical costs to fulfill claims. Obligations may also be recorded subsequent to the time of sale whenever specific events or circumstances impacting product quality become known that would not have been taken into account using historical data. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers and third-party contract manufacturers, the Company's warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage, and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. An adverse change in any of these factors may result in the need for additional warranty provisions. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's accrued warranty obligations amounted to $4,743,000. A 10% difference in accrued warranty obligations as of December 31, 2018 would have affected net income by approximately $407,000.\nContingencies\nEstimated losses from contingencies are accrued by management based upon whether a loss is probable and whether management has the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. Estimating potential losses, or even a range of losses, is difficult and involves a great deal of judgment. Management relies primarily on assessments made by its internal and external legal counsel to make the determination as to whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be recorded or disclosed. This analysis is performed each reporting period or when facts and circumstances dictate. Should the resolution of a contingency result in a loss that we did not accrue because management did not believe that the loss was probable or capable of being reasonably estimated, then this loss would result in a charge to income in the period the contingency was resolved. The Company did not have any significant accrued contingencies as of December 31, 2018.\nDerivative Instruments\nIn certain instances, the Company enters into forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations. The Company's forward contracts are reported at fair value based upon model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, and are therefore classified as Level 2. The Company's forward contracts are typically traded or executed in over-the-counter markets with a relatively high degree of pricing transparency. The market participants are generally large commercial banks.\nThe Company enters into two types of hedges to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. The first are economic hedges which utilize foreign currency forward contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising primarily from foreign-denominated receivables and payables. The gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to be offset by the changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities being hedged. These economic hedges are not designated as effective hedges, and therefore, do not qualify for effective hedge accounting. The second are cash flow hedges which utilize foreign currency forward contracts to protect our budgeted revenues and expenses against foreign currency exchange rate changes compared to our budgeted rates. These cash flow hedges are designated for hedge accounting, and therefore, the effective portion of the forward contract's gain or loss is reported in shareholders' equity as other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into current operations as the hedged transaction impacts current operations. Should these hedges fail to qualify for hedge accounting or be ineffective, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be reported in current operations immediately as opposed to when the hedged transaction impacts current operations. This may result in material foreign currency gains or losses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense is recognized for all stock option and restricted stock grants. Determining the appropriate valuation model and estimating the fair values of these grants requires the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, dividend yields, expected term, and forfeiture rates. The expected volatility assumption is based partially upon the historical volatility of the Company's common stock, which may or may not be a true indicator of future volatility, particularly as the Company continues to seek to diversify its customer base. The assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stock option grants represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company recorded in the current period.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining worldwide income tax expense based upon tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company has established reserves for income taxes by applying the more likely than not\u201d criteria, under which the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authority. All tax positions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification, such as the completion of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations, which may result in future charges or credits to income tax expense.\nAs part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. This process involves estimating the current tax liability, as well as assessing temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for financial statement and tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) was signed into law. The Tax Act resulted in a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the reduction in anticipated tax rate, the Company remeasured its deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017 at the new enacted tax rate, and accordingly, recorded tax expense of $12,523,000 in 2017 from the associated write-down of its deferred tax assets. In 2018, the Company recorded an increase in tax expense of $3,240,000 from the write-down of its deferred tax assets primarily relating to guidance under the Tax Act regarding stock-based compensation.\nThe Tax Act subjects unrepatriated foreign earnings to a one-time transition tax, regardless of the Company's financial statement assertion related to indefinite reinvestment or whether the Company ultimately repatriates any of the foreign earnings, for which the Company recorded estimated tax expense of $101,379,000 in 2017. In 2018, the Company revised its estimate of the one-time transition tax and recorded a decrease in tax expense of $11,028,000, which resulted in revised estimate for the one-time transition tax of $90,351,000 payable over eight years.\nThe Company will continue to gather and analyze information on historical unrepatriated foreign earnings and monitor state laws relating to this income to finalize both the federal and state tax impact. The Tax Act limits certain deductions and these limitations may impact the value of existing deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to review the impact of these limitations as regulatory guidance is issued.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Determining what constitutes a business to qualify as a business combination requires some judgment. Allocating the purchase price requires the Company to identify and estimate the fair values of various assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Management is responsible for determining the appropriate valuation model and estimated fair values, and in doing so, considers a number of factors, including information provided by an outside valuation advisor. Management primarily establishes fair value using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues and expenses, as well as discount factors. Contingent consideration liabilities are reported at their estimated fair values based upon probability-adjusted present values of the consideration expected to be paid, using significant inputs and estimates. Key assumptions used in these estimates include probability assessments with respect to the likelihood of achieving certain milestones and discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achievement. The fair value of these contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured each reporting period, with changes in the fair value recorded in \"Other income (expense)\" on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The remeasured liability amount could be significantly different from the amount at the acquisition date, resulting in material charges or credits in future reporting periods.\nNEW PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Part II, Item 8 - Note 2 within this Form 10-K, for a full description of recently issued accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and expected impact on the financial position and results of operations of the Company.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements made in this report, as well as oral statements made by the Company from time to time, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

In addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision products, the Company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support, consulting, and training services to its customers; however, service revenue accounted for less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.\nCognex machine vision is primarily used to automate manufacturing and distribution processes in a variety of industries, where the technology is widely recognized as an important component of automated production and quality assurance. Virtually every manufacturer can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, Cognex products are used by a broad base of customers across a variety of industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. Cognex products are also used outside of the manufacturing sector to automate distribution processes in the logistics industry for applications in retail distribution and ecommerce to scan, track, and sort goods through distribution centers.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" using the full retrospective method to present all periods reported on a consistent basis. Accordingly, prior period revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit have been restated to apply the provisions of this ASC.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $806,338,000, representing an increase of 5% over 2017. Lower revenue from customers in the consumer electronics industry was offset by higher revenue across a variety of other industries, including the logistics and automotive industries. Gross margin was 74.4% of revenue in 2018 compared to 75.6% of revenue in 2017 due primarily to a higher percentage of total revenue from the logistics industry, which currently has relatively lower gross margins. Operating expenses increased by 19% over 2017 due principally to the impact of headcount additions to support our future growth plans. Operating income decreased to 27% of revenue in 2018 from 34% of revenue in 2017, however net income increased to 27% of revenue in 2018 from 23% of revenue in 2017 due to a significantly lower effective tax rate. Income tax expense in 2017 included a one-time tra\nnsition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. Net income per diluted share increased to $1.24 in 2018 from $0.98 in 2017.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated financial data for continuing operations as a percentage of revenue:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research, development, and engineering expenses\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general, and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating income\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before income tax expense\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense on continuing operations\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs foreign currency exchange rates are a factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a constant-currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. We also use results on a constant-currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. Constant-currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant-currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Results on a constant-currency basis are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $806,338,000 compared to $766,083,000 for the prior year, representing an increase of $40,255,000, or 5%. Revenue in 2018 was impacted by lower sales in the consumer electronics industry primarily due to significantly lower revenue from a few large customers in OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display and smartphone manufacturing following a high level of investment from these customers in 2017. Excluding sales to customers in the consumer electronics industry, revenue increased by approximately 18% from the prior year, driven by growth in the logistics industry of over 50%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately 2% of the revenue increase from 2017 to 2018, primarily related to the translation of Euro-denominated and Chinese Yuan-denominated revenue to U.S. Dollars.\nRevenue from customers based in the Americas increased by 25% from the prior year driven by strong sales in the logistics industry. Revenue from customers based in Greater China increased by 16% from 2017, although this business was relatively flat in the fourth quarter of 2018 over the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenue from customers based in Europe decreased by 6% and revenue from customers based in other Asia regions decreased by 8% from the prior year. Revenue for both the Europe and Asia regions outside of Greater China was impacted by the lower sales in the consumer electronics industry noted above.\nAs of the date of this report, we expect revenue for the first quarter of 2019 to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition to the sequential decrease in revenue we typically experience in the first quarter as many manufacturing customers spend their capital budgets by the calendar year end, we are experiencing slower order trends in the automotive industry in the Americas and lower demand from customers based in Greater China.\nGross Margin\nGross margin as a percentage of revenue was 74.4% in 2018 compared to 75.6% in 2017. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a higher percentage of total revenue from the logistics industry. Certain sales in this industry are for application-specific customer solutions, which typically have lower gross margins due to deployment services. Unfavorable product mix for sales in the logistics industry also contributed to the lower gross margin percentage.\nThe Company's gross margin percentage has ranged in the mid 70s for the past several years. As of the date of this report, we expect the gross margin percentage for the first quarter of 2019 to continue to be within this historical range, but toward the lower end of this range due to anticipated unfavorable product mix toward sales in the logistics industry.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch, Development, and Engineering Expenses\nResearch, development, and engineering (RD&E) expenses in 2018 increased by $17,240,000, or 17%, from the prior year as detailed in the table below (in thousands).\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RD&E expenses in 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related costs\n</td> <td>10,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>3,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>3,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RD&E expenses in 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRD&E expenses increased due to higher personnel-related costs resulting primarily from headcount additions to support new product initiatives. Stock-based compensation expense was higher than the prior year due to a higher valuation of stock options granted, as well as a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate in 2018.\nRD&E expenses as a percentage of revenue were 14% in 2018 compared to 13% in 2017. We believe that a continued commitment to RD&E activities is essential in order to maintain or achieve a leadership position for our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, as well as to provide engineering support for strategic customers. In addition, we consider our ability to accelerate time to market for new products to be critical to our revenue growth. Therefore, we expect to continue to make significant RD&E investments in the future, and we target our annual RD&E spending to be between 10% and 15% of revenue. This percentage is impacted by revenue levels and investing cycles.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2018 increased by $41,971,000, or 19%, from the prior year as detailed in the table below (in thousands).\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses in 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related costs\n</td> <td>36,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>4,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation expense\n</td> <td>3,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive compensation plans\n</td> <td>(7,967\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>4,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses in 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSG&A expenses increased due to higher personnel-related costs resulting primarily from headcount additions, principally sales personnel. In addition to salaries and fringe benefits, these personnel-related costs included sales commissions and travel expenses related to the additional headcount. Stock-based compensation expense was higher than the prior year due to a higher valuation of stock options granted, as well as a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate in 2018. Depreciation expense increased from the prior year due primarily to information technology investments in infrastructure, security, and business applications, including a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that was placed into service in the middle of 2018. Offsetting these increases were lower expenses related to incentive compensation plans, including company bonuses and sales commissions, resulting from lower levels of achievement on performance plans that were set at the beginning of the year.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nThe Company recorded foreign currency losses of $1,064,000 in 2018 and $1,601,000 in 2017. The foreign currency gains and losses result primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany balances that are reported in one currency and collected or paid in another.\nInvestment income increased by $5,173,000, or 54%, from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher yields on the Company's portfolio of debt securities.\nThe Company recorded other expense of $219,000 in 2018 and $338,000 in 2017. Other income (expense) includes fair value adjustments of contingent consideration liabilities arising from business acquisitions, as well as rental income, net of associated expenses, from leasing space in buildings adjacent to the Company's corporate headquarters.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 7% of the Company's pre-tax income in 2018 compared to 34% in 2017.\nThe Tax Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) was signed into law. The Tax Act resulted in a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the reduction in anticipated tax rate, the Company remeasured its deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017 at the new enacted tax rate, and accordingly, recorded tax expense of $12,523,000 in 2017 from the associated write-down of its deferred tax assets. In 2018, the Company recorded an increase in tax expense of $3,240,000 from the write-down of its deferred tax assets primarily relating to guidance under the Tax Act regarding stock-based compensation.\nThe Tax Act subjects unrepatriated foreign earnings to a one-time transition tax, regardless of the Company's financial statement assertion related to indefinite reinvestment or whether the Company ultimately repatriates any of the foreign earnings, for which the Company recorded estimated tax expense of $101,379,000 in 2017. In 2018, the Company revised its estimate of the one-time transition tax and recorded a decrease in tax expense of $11,028,000, which resulted in a revised estimate for the one-time transition tax of $90,351,000 payable over eight years.\nThe Tax Act replaces the current system of taxing U.S. corporations on repatriated foreign earnings with a partial territorial system that provides a 100% dividends-received deduction to domestic corporations for foreign-source dividends received from 10% or more owned foreign corporations. The Company recorded a decrease in tax expense of $3,843,000 in 2017 from the reversal of the tax effect of a 2016 dividend paid in 2017 from a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary to its domestic entity.\nThe Company will continue to gather and analyze information on historical unrepatriated foreign earnings and monitor state laws relating to this income to finalize both the federal and state tax impact. The Tax Act limits certain deductions and these limitations may impact the value of existing deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to review the impact of these limitations as regulatory guidance is issued.\nOther Discrete Tax Items\nThe effective tax rate also included a decrease in tax expense of $8,488,000 in 2018, $38,569,000 in 2017, and $11,889,000 in 2016 from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises. The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods.\nIn 2018, tax expense included a provision for state income taxes of $620,000 from a change in management's financial statement assertion related to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. Management has determined that earnings from its legal entity in China will remain indefinitely reinvested to provide sufficient local funding for growth, and that earnings from all other jurisdictions will not be indefinitely reinvested resulting in the additional state income tax provision.\nOther discrete tax events resulted in a net decrease in tax expense of $2,467,000 in 2018 and a net decrease in tax expense of $2,502,000 in 2017, consisting primarily of i) the final true-up of the prior year's tax accrual upon filing the related tax returns and ii) the expiration of the statutes of limitations for certain reserves for income tax uncertainties.\nExcluding the impact of these discrete tax events, the Company's effective tax rate was 14% in 2018.\nThe Company is tax resident in numerous jurisdictions around the world and has identified its major tax jurisdictions as the United States, Ireland, and China. The statutory tax rate is 12.5% in Ireland and 25% in China, compared to the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate of 21%. International rights to certain of the Company's intellectual property are held by a subsidiary whose legal jurisdiction does not tax this income, resulting in a foreign effective tax rate lower than the above mentioned statutory rates.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $236,568,000, or 45%, from the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on revenue. Revenue increased by 32% in the Americas, 43% in Europe, and 63% in Asia due to a higher volume of machine vision products sold in all regions. Although the increase in revenue came from a variety of industries, strong sales in the logistics industry was a large\ncontributor to the growth in the Americas and strong sales in the consumer electronics industry was a large contributor to the growth in Europe and Asia.\nGross Margin\nGross margin as a percentage of revenue was 75.6% in 2017 compared to 75.2% in 2016. The increase in gross margin was due to the favorable impact of material cost reductions and volume purchasing, as well as manufacturing efficiencies achieved from a higher revenue level as fixed manufacturing costs were spread over a larger revenue base. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from a material customer in the consumer electronics industry under a preferred pricing arrangement, and to a lesser extent, an increased level of projects in the logistics industry that require installation services with lower margins.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch, Development, and Engineering Expenses\nResearch, development, and engineering (RD&E) expenses in 2017 increased by $20,936,000, or 27%, from the prior year as detailed in the table below (in thousands).\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RD&E expenses in 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related costs\n</td> <td>9,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>4,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outsourced engineering costs\n</td> <td>1,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>5,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RD&E expenses in 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRD&E expenses increased due to higher personnel-related costs resulting primarily from headcount additions, which included engineering talent from six business acquisitions completed since August 2016. The Company also incurred higher spending on outsourced engineering to support new product initiatives. Stock-based compensation expense was higher than the prior year due to a higher valuation of stock options granted early in 2017.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2017 increased by $54,618,000, or 33%, from the prior year as detailed in the table below (in thousands).\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses in 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related costs\n</td> <td>17,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive compensation plans\n</td> <td>10,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>5,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Travel expenses\n</td> <td>5,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ERP outside services\n</td> <td>3,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales demonstration equipment\n</td> <td>2,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recruiting costs\n</td> <td>2,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>6,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses in 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSG&A expenses increased due to higher personnel-related and recruiting costs resulting from headcount additions, principally sales personnel. In addition, higher incentive compensation plan expenses, including sales commission and Company bonus plans, were recorded in 2017 as a result of the additional headcount and higher achievement levels based upon the Company's performance. Travel expenses and sales demonstration equipment costs were also higher in 2017 due to additional sales personnel and the higher business level. Stock-based compensation expense was higher than the prior year due to a higher valuation of stock options granted early in 2017.\nIn 2017, the Company incurred costs for outside services related to the preliminary project and application development stages for a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, which is the management information system that integrates the Company's manufacturing, order fulfillment, and financial activities.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nThe Company recorded foreign currency losses of $1,601,000 in 2017 and foreign currency gains of $101,000 in 2016. The foreign currency losses in 2017 resulted primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable denominated in U.S. Dollars recorded on the books of the Company's Irish subsidiary, for which the functional currency\nis the Euro. During the period of time that these receivables were outstanding, the U.S. Dollar weakened versus the Euro resulting in foreign currency losses.\nInvestment income increased by $2,503,000, or 36%, from the prior year. The increase was due to higher yields, as well as additional funds available for investment on the Company's portfolio of debt securities.\nThe Company recorded other expense of $338,000 in 2017 and other income of $871,000 in 2016. Other income (expense) included a benefit of $28,000 in 2017 and a benefit of $463,000 in 2016 resulting from the revaluation of contingent consideration liabilities arising from business acquisitions. In addition, the Company received a foreign government subsidy in the amount of $422,000 that was recorded in other income in 2016. Other income (expense) also included rental income, net of associated expenses, from leasing space in buildings adjacent to the Company's corporate headquarters. Fewer tenants occupied this space in 2017, resulting in lower non-operating rental income.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 34% of the Company's pre-tax income in 2017 compared to 11% in 2016.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States Congress passed and the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act includes a number of changes that impact the Company's deferred tax positions, with the primary impact resulting from a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Company remeasured its deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017 at the new enacted tax rate, and accordingly, recorded tax expense of $12,523,000 from the write-down of deferred tax assets in 2017.\nIn addition, the Tax Act subjects unrepatriated foreign earnings to a one-time transition tax, regardless of the Company's financial statement assertion related to indefinite reinvestment or whether the Company ultimately repatriates any of the foreign earnings, for which the Company recorded estimated tax expense of $101,379,000 in 2017.\nFurthermore, the Tax Act replaces the current system of taxing U.S. corporations on repatriated foreign earnings with a partial territorial system that provides a 100% dividends-received deduction to domestic corporations for foreign-source dividends received from 10% or more owned foreign corporations. The Company recorded a decrease in tax expense of $3,843,000 in 2017 from the reversal of the tax effect of a 2016 dividend paid in 2017 from a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary to its domestic entity.\nIn addition to the 2017 impact of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate included a decrease in tax expense of $38,569,000 in 2017 and $11,889,000 in 2016 from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises. The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods.\nRemaining discrete tax events resulted in a decrease in tax expense of $2,502,000 in 2017, consisting primarily of the final true-up of the prior year's tax accrual upon filing the actual tax returns and the expiration of the statutes of limitations for certain reserves for income tax uncertainties, and an increase in tax expense of $475,000 in 2016.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company has historically been able to generate positive cash flow from operations, which has funded its operating activities and other cash requirements and has resulted in an accumulated cash and investment balance of $797,599,000 as of December 31, 2018. The Company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings, diversification, and maturities of its investments that maintain liquidity.\nThe Company's cash requirements in 2018 were primarily met with positive cash flows from operations. Cash requirements consisted of operating activities, the repurchase of common stock, the payment of dividends, and capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2018 totaled $37,095,000 and consisted primarily of computer hardware and software, manufacturing test equipment related to new product introductions, and improvements made to the Company's headquarters building in Natick, Massachusetts. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company placed into service a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system totaling $10,000,000 that is being depreciated over a ten year estimate useful life.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's material contractual obligations, both fixed and contingent (in thousands):\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>Inventory Purchase Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the obligations described above, the following items may also result in future material uses of cash:\nStock Repurchases\nIn April 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $100,000,000 of the Company's common stock. The Company repurchased 1,744,000 shares at a cost of $100,000,000 under this program, including 803,000 shares at a cost of $45,200,000 in the first quarter of 2018. In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $150,000,000 of the Company's common stock. The Company repurchased 3,174,000 shares at a cost of $150,000,000 under this program. In October 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $200,000,000 of the Company's common stock. As of December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 203,000 shares at a cost of $8,622,000 under this program, leaving a remaining balance of $191,378,000. Total stock repurchases in 2018 amounted to $203,822,000. The Company may repurchase shares under this program in future periods depending on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the impact of dilution from employee stock options, stock price, share availability, and cash requirements.\nDividends\nThe Company's Board of Directors declared and paid cash dividends of $0.045 per share in the first, second, and third quarters of 2018. The dividend was increased to $0.050 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Total dividends in 2018 amounted to $31,865,000. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board deems relevant, including, among other things, the Company's ability to generate positive cash flow from operations.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company's business strategy includes selective expansion into new machine vision markets and applications through the acquisition of businesses and technologies. Certain of the Company's business acquisitions have contractual obligations for deferred cash payments, contingent cash payments tied to performance, and special incentive cash payments tied to employment, none of which are material individually or in the aggregate to the Company's cash flows.\nThe Company believes that its existing cash and investment balances, together with cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet its operating, investing, and financing activities for the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $797,599,000 in cash and investments. In addition, Cognex has no long-term debt and does not anticipate needing debt financing in the near future. We believe that our strong cash position has put us in a relatively good position with respect to our longer-term liquidity needs.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or circumstances resulting in charges that could be material in future reporting periods. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d The core principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The framework in support of this core principle includes: (1) identifying the contract with the customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (5) recognizing revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied.\nIdentifying the Contract with the Customer\nThe Company identifies contracts with customers as agreements that create enforceable rights and obligations, which typically take the form of customer contracts or purchase orders.\nIdentifying the Performance Obligations in the Contract\nThe Company identifies performance obligations as promises in contracts to transfer distinct goods or services. Standard products and services that the Company regularly sells separately are accounted for as distinct performance obligations. Application-specific customer solutions that are comprised of a combination of products and services are accounted for as one performance obligation to deliver a total solution to the customer. On-site support services that are provided to the customer after the solution is deployed are accounted for as a separate performance obligation. These solutions are provided to customers in a variety of industries, including the consumer electronics, logistics, and automotive industries.\nShipping and handling activities for which the Company is responsible under the terms and conditions of the sale are not accounted for as performance obligations but as fulfillment costs. These activities are required to fulfill the Company's promise to transfer the goods and are expensed when revenue is recognized.\nThe Company does not assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract. If revenue is recognized before immaterial promises have been completed, then the costs related to such immaterial promises are accrued at the time of sale.\nDetermining the Transaction Price\nThe Company determines the transaction price as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer. Amounts collected from customers for sales taxes are excluded from the transaction price.\nIf a contract includes a variable amount, such as a rebate, then the Company estimates the transaction price using either the expected value or the most likely amount of consideration to be received, depending upon the specific facts and circumstances. The Company includes estimated variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. The Company updates its estimate of variable consideration at the end of each reporting period to reflect changes in facts and circumstances.\nAllocating the Transaction Price to the Performance Obligations\nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation at contract inception based on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, or the price at which the Company would sell the good or service separately to similar customers in similar circumstances.\nRecognizing Revenue When (or As) the Performance Obligations are Satisfied\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it transfers the promised goods or services to the customer. Revenue for standard products is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the goods, which is typically upon delivery when the customer has legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and an enforceable obligation to pay for the products. Revenue for services, which are not material, is typically recognized over the time the service is provided.\nRevenue for application-specific customer solutions is recognized at the point in time when the solution is validated, which is the point in time when the Company can objectively determine that the agreed-upon specifications in the contract have been met and the customer will accept the performance obligations in the arrangement. Although the customer may have taken legal title and physical possession of the goods when they arrived at the customer's designated site, the significant risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer only upon validation. Revenue for on-site support services related to these solutions is recognized over the time the service is provided.\nIn certain instances, an arrangement may include customer-specified acceptance provisions or performance guarantees that allow the customer to accept or reject delivered products that do not meet the customer's specifications. If the Company can objectively determine that control of a good or service has been transferred to the customer in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, then customer acceptance is a formality. If acceptance provisions are presumed to be substantive, then revenue is deferred until customer acceptance.\nFor the Company's standard products and services, revenue recognition and billing typically occur at the same time. For application-specific customer solutions, however, the agreement with the customer may provide for billing terms which differ from revenue recognition criteria, resulting in either deferred revenue or unbilled revenue. Credit assessments are performed to determine payment terms, which vary by region, industry, and customer. Prepayment terms result in contract liabilities for customer deposits. When credit is granted to customers, payment is typically due 30 to 90 days from billing. The Company's contracts have an original expected duration of less than one year, and therefore as a practical expedient, the Company has elected to ignore the impact of the time value of money on a contract and to expense sales commissions. The Company recognizes an asset for costs to fulfill a contract if the costs relate directly to the contract and to future performance, and the costs are expected to be recovered.\nManagement exercises judgment when determining the amount of revenue to be recognized each period. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, assessing the customer's ability and intention to pay substantially all of the contract consideration when due, determining when two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract, determining whether a contract modification has occurred, assessing whether promises are immaterial in the context of the contract, determining whether material promises in a contract represent distinct performance obligations, estimating the transaction price for a contract that contains variable consideration, determining the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation, determining whether control is transferred over time or at a point in time for performance obligations, and assessing whether formal customer acceptance provisions are substantive.\nInvestments\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company's investment portfolio of debt securities totaled $689,387,000. The debt securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in shareholders' equity as other comprehensive income (loss) since these securities are designated as available-for-sale securities. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's portfolio of debt securities had a net unrealized loss of $1,932,000. Included in this net loss were gross unrealized losses totaling $2,255,000, of which $1,445,000 were in a loss position for less than twelve months and $810,000 were in a loss position for greater than twelve months.\nThe Company applies a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements. The categorization of assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology utilize unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology are other observable inputs, including quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical and similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based upon management's best estimate of the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk. Changes in the valuation methodology, interest rates, credit rates, or the market for these investments could result in changes to their fair values. Changes to the Level of an investment within the fair value hierarchy are determined at the end of the reporting period.\nThe Company's debt securities are reported at fair value based upon model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term\nof the asset, and are therefore classified as Level 2. Management is responsible for estimating the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities, and in doing so, considers valuations provided by a large, third-party pricing service. This service maintains regular contact with market makers, brokers, dealers, and analysts to gather information on market movement, direction, trends, and other specific data. They use this information to structure yield curves for various types of debt securities and arrive at the daily valuations.\nManagement monitors the carrying value of its debt securities compared to their fair value to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. In considering whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, we consider many factors, both qualitative and quantitative in nature, including the type of security, the credit rating of the security, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the size of the loss position, our ability and intent to hold the security to expected recovery of value, and other meaningful information. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded in current operations to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its fair value. There were no other-than-temporary impairments of investments in 2018, 2017, or 2016.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company maintains reserves against its accounts receivable for potential credit losses. Ongoing credit evaluations of customers are performed and the Company has historically not experienced significant losses related to the collection of its accounts receivable. Allowances for specific accounts determined to be at risk for collection are estimated by management taking into account the length of time the receivable has been outstanding, the customer's current ability to pay its obligations to the Company, general economic and industry conditions, as well as various other factors. Global economic uncertainty may result in longer payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable balances, which make these estimates more judgmental. An adverse change in any of these factors could result in higher than expected customer defaults and may result in the need for additional bad debt provisions. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's reserve against accounts receivable was $1,646,000, or 1% of the gross accounts receivable balance. A 10% difference in the reserve against accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018 would have affected net income by approximately $141,000.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less readily predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Management estimates excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand, product transitions, and market conditions, and records reserves to reduce the carrying value of inventories to their net realizable value. Volatility in the global economy makes these assumptions about future demand more judgmental. Among the risks associated with the introduction of new products are difficulty predicting customer demand and effectively managing inventory levels to ensure adequate supply of the new product and avoid excess supply of the legacy product. In addition, we may strategically enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors to purchase materials for products in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or address concerns about the availability of future supplies and long lead times. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's reserve for excess and obsolete inventory totaled $4,684,000, or 5% of the gross inventory balance. A 10% difference in inventory reserves as of December 31, 2018 would have affected net income by approximately $402,000.\nLong-lived Assets\nThe Company has long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment and acquired intangible assets. These assets are susceptible to shortened estimated useful lives and changes in fair value due to changes in their use, market or economic changes, or other events or circumstances. The Company evaluates the potential impairment of these long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include historical or projected results that are less than the assumptions used in the original valuation of an acquired asset, a change in the Company's business strategy or its use of an acquired asset, or negative economic or industry trends.\nIf an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability of the assets by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company compares the fair value of the long-lived assets to the carrying value and records an impairment loss for the difference. The Company generally estimates the fair value of its long-lived assets using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues and expenses, discount factors, income tax rates, the identification of groups of assets with highly independent cash flows, and assets' economic lives. Volatility in the global economy makes these assumptions and estimates more judgmental. In 2017, the Company determined that the carrying value of the customer relationship\ns arising from the AQSense acquisition was impaired and reduced this value to zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $469,000. The Company did not record an impairment charge related to long-lived assets in 2018 or 2016. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from those used in assessing the recoverability of these assets and could result in an impairment of long-lived assets in future periods.\nInternal-use Software\nThe accounting treatment for computer software developed for internal use depends upon the nature of activities performed at each stage of development. The preliminary project stage includes conceptual formulation of design alternatives, determination of system requirements, vendor demonstrations, and final selection of vendors, and during this stage costs are expensed as incurred. The application development stage includes software configuration, coding, hardware installation, and testing. During this stage, certain costs are capitalized, including external direct costs of materials and services, as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with the project, while certain costs are expensed as incurred, including training and data conversion costs. The post-implementation stage includes support and maintenance, and during this stage costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalization begins when both the preliminary project stage is completed and management commits to funding the project. Capitalization ceases at the point the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, that is, after all substantial testing is completed. The application of these rules requires the use of judgment to determine when the project has reached the next stage of development, which costs are directly associated with the project, and when the asset is ready for its intended use.\nGoodwill\nManagement evaluates the potential impairment of goodwill annually each fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The Company currently operates under one reporting unit which is the level at which the goodwill impairment analysis is performed. Determining the Company's reporting units requires judgments regarding what constitutes a business and at what level discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management.\nThe Company performs a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. Under this quantitative analysis, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the Company recognizes an impairment charge. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model. In addition, the Company uses the market approach, which compares the reporting unit to publicly-traded companies and transactions involving similar businesses, to support the conclusions based upon the income approach. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues, expenses, capital expenditures, and working capital, as well as discount factors and income tax rates.\nFactors that management considered in the qualitative assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance (both current and projected), changes in management or strategy, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets, and market capitalization. Based on the qualitative assessment, management does not believe that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value. No impairment losses were recorded in 2018, 2017, or 2016.\nWarranty Obligations\nThe Company records the estimated cost of fulfilling product warranties at the time of sale based upon historical costs to fulfill claims. Obligations may also be recorded subsequent to the time of sale whenever specific events or circumstances impacting product quality become known that would not have been taken into account using historical data. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers and third-party contract manufacturers, the Company's warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage, and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. An adverse change in any of these factors may result in the need for additional warranty provisions. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's accrued warranty obligations amounted to $4,743,000. A 10% difference in accrued warranty obligations as of December 31, 2018 would have affected net income by approximately $407,000.\nContingencies\nEstimated losses from contingencies are accrued by management based upon whether a loss is probable and whether management has the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. Estimating potential losses, or even a range of losses, is difficult and involves a great deal of judgment. Management relies primarily on assessments made by its internal and external legal counsel to make the determination as to whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be recorded or disclosed. This analysis is performed each reporting period or when facts and circumstances dictate. Should the resolution of a contingency result in a loss that we did not accrue because management did not believe that the loss was probable or capable of being reasonably estimated, then this loss would result in a charge to income in the period the contingency was resolved. The Company did not have any significant accrued contingencies as of December 31, 2018.\nDerivative Instruments\nIn certain instances, the Company enters into forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations. The Company's forward contracts are reported at fair value based upon model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, and are therefore classified as Level 2. The Company's forward contracts are typically traded or executed in over-the-counter markets with a relatively high degree of pricing transparency. The market participants are generally large commercial banks.\nThe Company enters into two types of hedges to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. The first are economic hedges which utilize foreign currency forward contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising primarily from foreign-denominated receivables and payables. The gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to be offset by the changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities being hedged. These economic hedges are not designated as effective hedges, and therefore, do not qualify for effective hedge accounting. The second are cash flow hedges which utilize foreign currency forward contracts to protect our budgeted revenues and expenses against foreign currency exchange rate changes compared to our budgeted rates. These cash flow hedges are designated for hedge accounting, and therefore, the effective portion of the forward contract's gain or loss is reported in shareholders' equity as other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into current operations as the hedged transaction impacts current operations. Should these hedges fail to qualify for hedge accounting or be ineffective, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be reported in current operations immediately as opposed to when the hedged transaction impacts current operations. This may result in material foreign currency gains or losses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense is recognized for all stock option and restricted stock grants. Determining the appropriate valuation model and estimating the fair values of these grants requires the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, dividend yields, expected term, and forfeiture rates. The expected volatility assumption is based partially upon the historical volatility of the Company's common stock, which may or may not be a true indicator of future volatility, particularly as the Company continues to seek to diversify its customer base. The assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stock option grants represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company recorded in the current period.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining worldwide income tax expense based upon tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company has established reserves for income taxes by applying the more likely than not\u201d criteria, under which the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authority. All tax positions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification, such as the completion of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations, which may result in future charges or credits to income tax expense.\nAs part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. This process involves estimating the current tax liability, as well as assessing temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for financial statement and tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) was signed into law. The Tax Act resulted in a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the reduction in anticipated tax rate, the Company remeasured its deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017 at the new enacted tax rate, and accordingly, recorded tax expense of $12,523,000 in 2017 from the associated write-down of its deferred tax assets. In 2018, the Company recorded an increase in tax expense of $3,240,000 from the write-down of its deferred tax assets primarily relating to guidance under the Tax Act regarding stock-based compensation.\nThe Tax Act subjects unrepatriated foreign earnings to a one-time transition tax, regardless of the Company's financial statement assertion related to indefinite reinvestment or whether the Company ultimately repatriates any of the foreign earnings, for which the Company recorded estimated tax expense of $101,379,000 in 2017. In 2018, the Company revised its estimate of the one-time transition tax and recorded a decrease in tax expense of $11,028,000, which resulted in revised estimate for the one-time transition tax of $90,351,000 payable over eight years.\nThe Company will continue to gather and analyze information on historical unrepatriated foreign earnings and monitor state laws relating to this income to finalize both the federal and state tax impact. The Tax Act limits certain deductions and these limitations may impact the value of existing deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to review the impact of these limitations as regulatory guidance is issued.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Determining what constitutes a business to qualify as a business combination requires some judgment. Allocating the purchase price requires the Company to identify and estimate the fair values of various assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Management is responsible for determining the appropriate valuation model and estimated fair values, and in doing so, considers a number of factors, including information provided by an outside valuation advisor. Management primarily establishes fair value using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues and expenses, as well as discount factors. Contingent consideration liabilities are reported at their estimated fair values based upon probability-adjusted present values of the consideration expected to be paid, using significant inputs and estimates. Key assumptions used in these estimates include probability assessments with respect to the likelihood of achieving certain milestones and discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achievement. The fair value of these contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured each reporting period, with changes in the fair value recorded in \"Other income (expense)\" on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The remeasured liability amount could be significantly different from the amount at the acquisition date, resulting in material charges or credits in future reporting periods.\nNEW PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Part II, Item 8 - Note 2 within this Form 10-K, for a full description of recently issued accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and expected impact on the financial position and results of operations of the Company."}
