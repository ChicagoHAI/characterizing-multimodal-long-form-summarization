MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nThe Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed on August 8, 2003. The Trust is a multi-advisor commodity pool, as described in CFTC Regulation \u00a7 4.10(d)(2). The Trust is authorized to issue multiple Series of Units, pursuant to the requirements of the Trust Act. The assets of each Series are held and accounted for in separate and distinct records separately from the assets of other Series. The Trust is managed by the Managing Owner, and its term will expire on December 31, 2053 (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances).\nThe Trust, with respect to each Series of Units, engages in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forward (including interbank foreign currencies) and options contracts and other derivative instruments (including swaps). The Trust allocates funds to affiliated Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities, each of which has one-year renewable contracts with its own independent Trading Advisor(s) that will manage all or a portion of the applicable Trading Company's or Galaxy Plus entity's assets, and make the trading decisions for the assets of each Series vested in such Trading Company or Galaxy Plus entity. The assets of each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity will be segregated from the assets of each other Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity. The Trust has an investment objective of increasing the value of the Units over the long term (capital appreciation), while controlling risk and volatility; further, to offer exposure to the investment programs of individual Trading Advisors and to specific instruments (currencies). For additional overview of the Trust's structure and business activities, see Item 1 BUSINESS.\u201d For a discussion of fees paid by the Trust, see Item 11 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires the Managing Owner to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust's most significant accounting policy, described below, includes the valuation of its futures and forward contracts, options contracts, swap contracts, U.S. Treasury securities and investments in unconsolidated Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities. The majority of these investments are exchange traded contracts valued upon exchange settlement prices or non-exchange traded contracts and obligations with valuation based on third-party quoted dealer values on the Interbank market.\nThe Trust's other significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2 of the financial statements.\nInvestment Transactions and Valuation\nThe Managing Owner has evaluated the nature and type of transactions processed and estimates that it makes in preparing the Trust's financial statements and related disclosures and has adopted Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, and implemented the framework for measuring fair value for assets and liabilities.\nThe Trust utilizes valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach per the requirement of ASC 820 for the valuation of futures (exchange traded) contracts, forward (non-exchange traded) contracts, option contracts, swap contracts and other non-cash assets. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The Trust applies the valuation techniques in a consistent manner for each asset or liability. The Trust records all investments at fair value in its Statements of Financial Condition, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net gain/(loss) on investments in the Statements of Operations.\nInputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. Inputs may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the financial asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources, or unobservable, meaning those that reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the financial asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nIn addition, the Trust monitors counterparty credit risk and incorporates any identified risk factors when assigning input levels to underlying financial assets or liabilities. In that regard ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. A full disclosure of the fair value hierarchy is presented in Note 3 of the financial statements-Fair Value Measurements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Trust will raise additional capital only through the sale of Units offered pursuant to the continuing offering and does not intend to raise any capital through borrowing. Due to the nature of the Trust's business, it makes no capital expenditures and has no capital assets that are not operating capital or assets.\nThe Managing Owner is responsible for the payment of all of the ordinary expenses associated with the organization of the Trust and the offering of each Series of Units, except for the initial and ongoing service fee, if any, and no Series will be required to reimburse these expenses. As a result, 100% of each Series' offering proceeds are initially available for that Series' trading activities.\nA portion of each Trading Company's assets is used as margin to maintain that Trading Company's forward currency contract positions, and another portion is deposited in cash in segregated accounts in the name of each Trading Company maintained for each Trading Company at the clearing brokers in accordance with CFTC segregation requirements. At December 31, 2021, cash deposited at the clearing brokers was $801,700 for the Trust. The clearing brokers are expected to credit each Trading Company with approximately 80%-100% of the interest earned on its average net assets on deposit with the clearing brokers each month. Currently, with the Federal Funds target rate at 0.00 to 0.25%, this amount is estimated to be 0.00%. In an attempt to increase interest income earned, the Managing Owner also may invest the non-margin assets in U.S. government securities which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S., or by a person controlled by or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the government of the U.S. pursuant to authority granted by Congress or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing, including U.S. Treasury bonds, U.S. Treasury bills and issues of agencies of the U.S. government, and certain cash items such as money market funds and time deposits. Aggregate interest income from all sources, including US Treasury Securities assets net of premiums and cash held at clearing brokers, of up to 2% (annualized) is paid to the Managing Owner by the Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1 and Class 2 only), Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 2 and Class 3), Frontier Global Fund, Frontier Select Fund and Frontier Heritage Fund. For the Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 2a and Class 3a), Frontier Masters Fund and Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a), 100% of the interest is retained by the respective Series. The amount reflected in the financial statements for the Trust and Series are disclosed on a net basis. Due to some classes not exceeding the 2% paid to the Managing Owner, amounts earned by those classes may be zero.\nApproximately 70% to 90% of the Trust's assets are expected to be committed as required margin for futures contracts and forwards and options trading and held by the respective broker, although the amount committed may vary significantly. Such assets are maintained in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury bills in segregated accounts with the futures broker pursuant to the CEA and regulations there under. The remaining approximately 10% to 30% of the Trust's assets will normally be invested in cash equivalents and short-term investments, such as money market funds and time deposits and held by the clearing broker, the over-the-counter counterparties and by U.S. federally chartered banks. As of December 31, 2021, total cash and cash equivalents held at banking institutions were $165,491 for the Frontier Diversified Fund, $40,528 for the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, $76,703 for the Frontier Masters Fund, $188,010 for the Frontier Balanced Fund, $51,140 for the Frontier Select Fund, $128,021 for the Frontier Global Fund, and $48,839 for the Frontier Heritage Fund.\nAs a commodity pool, the Trust has large cash positions. Such cash positions are used to pay margin for the trading of futures, forwards and options, and also to pay redemptions. Generally, the Trust has not been forced to liquidate positions to fund redemptions. As of December 31, 2021, the redemptions payable were $20,299 for the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, $20,382 for the Frontier Balanced Fund and $27,561 for the Frontier Global Fund During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Trust was able to pay all redemptions on a timely basis.\nOff-Balance Sheet Risk\nThe term off-balance sheet risk\u201d refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. Each Trading Company trades in futures, forward and swap contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts there exists a market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions held by a Trading Company in respect of any Series at the same time, and if the Trading Advisor(s) of such Trading Company are unable to offset such futures interests positions, such Trading Company could lose all of its assets and the holders of Units of such Series would realize a 100% loss. The Managing Owner seeks to minimize market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions and the level of diversification of each Trading Advisor's portfolio. It is anticipated that any Trading Advisor's margin-to-equity ratio will typically not exceed approximately 35% although the actual ratio could be higher or lower from time to time.\nIn addition to market risk, trading futures forward and swap contracts entails credit risk which is the risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to a Trading Company. The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the U.S. and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. Some non-U.S. exchanges, in contrast to U.S. exchanges are principals' markets in which performance is the responsibility only of the individual counterparty with whom the Trading Company has entered into the transaction and not of the exchange or clearing corporation. In these kinds of markets, there is risk of bankruptcy or other failure or refusal to perform by the counterparty.\nIn the case of forward contracts traded on the interbank market and swaps, neither is traded on an exchange. The counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a group of financial institutions; thus, there may be a greater counterparty credit risk. The Managing Owner expects the Trading Advisors to trade only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of each Trading Company are valued each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to any Trading Company.\nThe Trust has entered into agreements, which provide for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, currency trading companies, and commodity trading advisers, among others, against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their individual obligations under such agreements, except for gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Trust has had no prior claims or payments pursuant to these agreements. The Trust's individual maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects the risk of loss to be remote.\nDisclosure of Contractual Obligations\nThe business of the Trust is the speculative trading of commodity interests. The majority of the Trust's futures and forward positions, which may be categorized as purchase obligations\u201d under Item 303 of Regulation S-K, are short-term. That is, they are held for less than one year. Because the Trust does not enter into other long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or other long-term liabilities that would otherwise be reflected on the Trust's Statement of Financial Condition, a table of contractual obligations has not been presented.\nResults of Operations for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021\nSeries Returns and Other Information\nThe returns for each Series and Class of Units for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, and related information, are discussed below. The activities of the Trust on a consolidated basis are explained through the activity of the underlying Series. Please refer to the discussion of the Series activities in relation to the Trust on a consolidated basis.\nEach Series had exposure to commodity interest positions within one or more sectors during fiscal 2021. The performance of each Series was impacted over the course of the year by, among other things, the relative performance of the relevant sector or sectors and the commodities within those sectors, the changing allocations among, and the specific positions taken by, the Series' Trading Advisors in, the relevant sector(s) and commodities, and the timing of entries and exits. For each of the Series, a sector attribution chart has been included at the end of the relevant discussion. Each chart depicts the performance of the relevant Series' positions within each of the relevant sectors (determined by the Managing Owner using monthly gross return and NAV figures, with various adjustments to net out a proportional allocation of the fees and expenses chargeable to the Series) during the fourth quarter (except as otherwise noted) and for the full calendar year.

The activities of the Trust on a consolidated basis are explained through the activity of the underlying Series. Please refer to the discussion of the Series activities in relation to the Trust on a consolidated basis.\nEach Series had exposure to commodity interest positions within one or more sectors during fiscal 2020. The performance of each Series was impacted over the course of the year by, among other things, the relative performance of the relevant sector or sectors and the commodities within those sectors, the changing allocations among, and the specific positions taken by, the Series' Trading Advisors in, the relevant sector(s) and commodities, and the timing of entries and exits. For each of the Series, a sector attribution chart has been included at the end of the relevant discussion. Each chart depicts the performance of the relevant Series' positions within each of the relevant sectors (determined by the Managing Owner using monthly gross return and NAV figures, with various adjustments to net out a proportional allocation of the fees and expenses chargeable to the Series) during the fourth quarter (except as otherwise noted) and for the full calendar year. Charts depicting the performance of the various Series' positions within each of the relevant sectors during the prior three quarters were included in the Trust's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q previously filed.\nDuring the periods covered by this report, for a Series that was invested in a swap, a trading advisor did not receive any management fees directly from the Series for such swap, and instead the relevant trading advisor received compensation via the fees embedded in the swap. In each case, the embedded management fee was accrued on the relevant notional amount of the swap.\nThe swaps owned by Frontier Heritage Fund and Frontier Select Fund (through its investment in an unconsolidated trading company) were terminated effective May 30, 2020, and the swaps owned by Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund and Frontier Diversified Fund were terminated effective December 21, 2020.\nFrontier Diversified Fund\nThe Frontier Diversified Fund - Class 1 NAV lost 28.11% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, net of fees and expenses; the Frontier Diversified Fund - Class 2 NAV lost 26.84% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, net of fees and expenses; the Frontier Diversified Fund - Class 3 NAV lost 26.65% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, net of fees and expenses.

The NAV per Unit, Class 1, decreased from $101.10 at December 31, 2019, to $72.68 as of December 31, 2020.

There were inter-class transfers of $987,405 from Class 1 to Class 3 for the period. Ending capital at December 31, 2020, was $154,260 for Class 1, $466,224, for Class 2, and $3,562,487 for Class 3.\nDuring the periods covered by this report, the Frontier Diversified Fund invested in one or more swaps. The swap owned by the Frontier Diversified Fund was terminated effective December 21, 2020. To the extent that the Series invested in a swap, the swap referenced an index, consisting of the performance realized on the trading program of one or more commodity trading advisors. Such performance was net of management fees and incentive fees paid to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s), brokerage fees and certain other related fees and charges, and therefore these fees were said to be embedded.\nThe aggregate fees embedded in a swap were provided for in the index description for the relevant swap. In addition to the management fee and incentive fee for the commodity trading advisor(s) (the CTA Fees\u201d), each index provided for the deduction of a management fee to the counterparty for the swap. The counterparty management fee was determined based on the management fee spread set forth in the index description, while the CTA Fees were based on a percentage of the assets managed by each trading advisor and new trading profits, respectively, and were set forth in the reports delivered to the Series by the counterparty. In addition to the counterparty management fee and the CTA Fees, the underlying transactions executed by the commodity trading advisors may have been subject to the deduction of certain prime brokerage, exchange and other related fees and charges, each of which were reflected in the transaction values, and consequently the value of the index.\nThe management fees payable to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s) comprising the index referenced in the swaps was 1.00% per annum of notional assets. The incentive fees payable to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s) comprising the index referenced in the swaps ranged from 20% to 25% of new net trading profits on a monthly or quarterly basis. To the extent that there were embedded management fees and incentive fees incurred in a swap investment, the Managing Owner waived any management and incentive fees to which it was otherwise entitled. The management and incentive fees embedded in a swap may have been higher or lower than the management and incentive fees that would have otherwise been charged to a Series by the Managing Owner.\nDuring the periods covered by this report, the management fee embedded in swaps owned by Frontier Diversified Fund was 1.00% per annum, and the managing owner waived the entire management fee due to it from those Series in respect of such Series' investment in swaps. In each case, the embedded management fee was accrued on the relevant notional amount of the swap.\nBased on an analysis of the management fees charged to Frontier Diversified Fund, the effective management fee rate of the Series was higher than the management fee rate otherwise payable to the Managing Owner for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective management fee rate for the Series was calculated for the period covered by the Form 10-K by dividing the aggregate management fees paid by such Series (whether directly to the Managing Owner, or as an embedded management fee paid to a third-party commodity trading advisor) by the aggregate assets on which such management fees were paid. For the period ended December 31, 2020, the effective management fee rate of Frontier Diversified Fund was 0.78%, compared to a management fee payable to the Managing Owner of 0.75%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the management and incentive fees embedded in gains (losses) from trading companies owned by Frontier Diversified Fund was $27,253.\nThe Frontier Diversified Fund may have both long and short exposure to the Interest Rates, Currencies, Stock Indices, Energies, Metals and Commodities sectors.\nSector & Major Advisor Attribution for the Frontier Diversified Fund\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFour of the six sectors traded in the Frontier Diversified Fund were profitable in Q4 2020.

Such performance was net of management fees and incentive fees paid to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s), brokerage fees and certain other related fees and charges, and therefore these fees were said to be embedded.\nThe aggregate fees embedded in a swap were provided for in the index description for the relevant swap. In addition to the CTA Fees, each index provided for the deduction of a management fee to the counterparty for the swap. The counterparty management fee was determined based on the management fee spread set forth in the index description, while the CTA Fees were based on a percentage of the assets managed by each trading advisor and new trading profits, respectively, and were set forth in the reports delivered to the Series by the counterparty. In addition to the counterparty management fee and the CTA Fees, the underlying transactions executed by the commodity trading advisors may have been subject to the deduction of certain prime brokerage, exchange and other related fees and charges, each of which were reflected in the transaction values, and consequently the value of the index.\nThe management fees payable to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s) comprising the index referenced in the swaps was 1.00% per annum of notional assets. The incentive fees payable to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s) comprising the index referenced in the swaps was 15% of new net trading profits on a monthly or quarterly basis. To the extent that there were embedded management fees and incentive fees incurred in a swap investment, the Managing Owner waived any management and incentive fees to which it was otherwise entitled. The management and incentive fees embedded in a swap may have been higher or lower than the management and incentive fees that would have otherwise been charged to a Series by the Managing Owner.\nDuring the periods covered by this report, the management fee embedded in swaps owned by Frontier Select Fund was 1.00% per annum, and the managing owner waived the entire management fee due to it from those Series in respect of such Series' investment in swaps. In each case, the embedded management fee was accrued on the relevant notional amount of the swap.\nBased on an analysis of the management fees charged to Frontier Select Fund, the effective management fee rate of the Series was lower than the management fee rate otherwise payable to the Managing Owner for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective management fee rate for the Series was calculated for the period covered by the Form 10-K by dividing the aggregate management fees paid by such Series (whether directly to the Managing Owner, or as an embedded management fee paid to a third-party commodity trading advisor) by the aggregate assets on which such management fees were paid. For the period ended December 31, 2020, the effective management fee rate of Frontier Select Fund was 2.18%, compared to a management fee payable to the Managing Owner of 2.50%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the management and incentive fees embedded in gains (losses) from trading companies owned by Frontier Select Fund was $7,341.\nThe Frontier Select Fund may have both long and short exposure to the Interest Rates, Currencies, Stock Indices, Energies, Metals, Hybrids and Commodities sectors.\nSector & Major Advisor Attribution for the Frontier Select Fund\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFour of the six sectors traded in the Frontier Select Fund were profitable in Q4 2020.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nThe Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed on August 8, 2003. The Trust is a multi-advisor commodity pool, as described in CFTC Regulation \u00a7 4.10(d)(2). The Trust is authorized to issue multiple Series of Units, pursuant to the requirements of the Trust Act. The assets of each Series are held and accounted for in separate and distinct records separately from the assets of other Series. The Trust is managed by the Managing Owner, and its term will expire on December 31, 2053 (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances).\nThe Trust, with respect to each Series of Units, engages in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forward (including interbank foreign currencies) and options contracts and other derivative instruments (including swaps). The Trust allocates funds to affiliated Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities, each of which has one-year renewable contracts with its own independent Trading Advisor(s) that will manage all or a portion of the applicable Trading Company's or Galaxy Plus entity's assets, and make the trading decisions for the assets of each Series vested in such Trading Company or Galaxy Plus entity. The assets of each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity will be segregated from the assets of each other Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity. The Trust has an investment objective of increasing the value of the Units over the long term (capital appreciation), while controlling risk and volatility; further, to offer exposure to the investment programs of individual Trading Advisors and to specific instruments (currencies). For additional overview of the Trust's structure and business activities, see Item 1 BUSINESS.\u201d For a discussion of fees paid by the Trust, see Item 11 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires the Managing Owner to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust's most significant accounting policy, described below, includes the valuation of its futures and forward contracts, options contracts, swap contracts, U.S. Treasury securities and investments in unconsolidated Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities. The majority of these investments are exchange traded contracts valued upon exchange settlement prices or non-exchange traded contracts and obligations with valuation based on third-party quoted dealer values on the Interbank market.\nThe Trust's other significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2 of the financial statements.\nInvestment Transactions and Valuation\nThe Managing Owner has evaluated the nature and type of transactions processed and estimates that it makes in preparing the Trust's financial statements and related disclosures and has adopted Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, and implemented the framework for measuring fair value for assets and liabilities.\nThe Trust utilizes valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach per the requirement of ASC 820 for the valuation of futures (exchange traded) contracts, forward (non-exchange traded) contracts, option contracts, swap contracts and other non-cash assets. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The Trust applies the valuation techniques in a consistent manner for each asset or liability. The Trust records all investments at fair value in its Statements of Financial Condition, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net gain/(loss) on investments in the Statements of Operations.\nInputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. Inputs may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the financial asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources, or unobservable, meaning those that reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the financial asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nIn addition, the Trust monitors counterparty credit risk and incorporates any identified risk factors when assigning input levels to underlying financial assets or liabilities. In that regard ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. A full disclosure of the fair value hierarchy is presented in Note 3 of the financial statements-Fair Value Measurements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Trust will raise additional capital only through the sale of Units offered pursuant to the continuing offering and does not intend to raise any capital through borrowing. Due to the nature of the Trust's business, it makes no capital expenditures and has no capital assets that are not operating capital or assets.\nThe Managing Owner is responsible for the payment of all of the ordinary expenses associated with the organization of the Trust and the offering of each Series of Units, except for the initial and ongoing service fee, if any, and no Series will be required to reimburse these expenses. As a result, 100% of each Series' offering proceeds are initially available for that Series' trading activities.\nA portion of each Trading Company's assets is used as margin to maintain that Trading Company's forward currency contract positions, and another portion is deposited in cash in segregated accounts in the name of each Trading Company maintained for each Trading Company at the clearing brokers in accordance with CFTC segregation requirements. At December 31, 2021, cash deposited at the clearing brokers was $801,700 for the Trust. The clearing brokers are expected to credit each Trading Company with approximately 80%-100% of the interest earned on its average net assets on deposit with the clearing brokers each month. Currently, with the Federal Funds target rate at 0.00 to 0.25%, this amount is estimated to be 0.00%. In an attempt to increase interest income earned, the Managing Owner also may invest the non-margin assets in U.S. government securities which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S., or by a person controlled by or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the government of the U.S. pursuant to authority granted by Congress or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing, including U.S. Treasury bonds, U.S. Treasury bills and issues of agencies of the U.S. government, and certain cash items such as money market funds and time deposits. Aggregate interest income from all sources, including US Treasury Securities assets net of premiums and cash held at clearing brokers, of up to 2% (annualized) is paid to the Managing Owner by the Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1 and Class 2 only), Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 2 and Class 3), Frontier Global Fund, Frontier Select Fund and Frontier Heritage Fund. For the Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 2a and Class 3a), Frontier Masters Fund and Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a), 100% of the interest is retained by the respective Series. The amount reflected in the financial statements for the Trust and Series are disclosed on a net basis. Due to some classes not exceeding the 2% paid to the Managing Owner, amounts earned by those classes may be zero.\nApproximately 70% to 90% of the Trust's assets are expected to be committed as required margin for futures contracts and forwards and options trading and held by the respective broker, although the amount committed may vary significantly. Such assets are maintained in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury bills in segregated accounts with the futures broker pursuant to the CEA and regulations there under. The remaining approximately 10% to 30% of the Trust's assets will normally be invested in cash equivalents and short-term investments, such as money market funds and time deposits and held by the clearing broker, the over-the-counter counterparties and by U.S. federally chartered banks. As of December 31, 2021, total cash and cash equivalents held at banking institutions were $165,491 for the Frontier Diversified Fund, $40,528 for the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, $76,703 for the Frontier Masters Fund, $188,010 for the Frontier Balanced Fund, $51,140 for the Frontier Select Fund, $128,021 for the Frontier Global Fund, and $48,839 for the Frontier Heritage Fund.\nAs a commodity pool, the Trust has large cash positions. Such cash positions are used to pay margin for the trading of futures, forwards and options, and also to pay redemptions. Generally, the Trust has not been forced to liquidate positions to fund redemptions. As of December 31, 2021, the redemptions payable were $20,299 for the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, $20,382 for the Frontier Balanced Fund and $27,561 for the Frontier Global Fund During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Trust was able to pay all redemptions on a timely basis.\nOff-Balance Sheet Risk\nThe term off-balance sheet risk\u201d refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. Each Trading Company trades in futures, forward and swap contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts there exists a market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions held by a Trading Company in respect of any Series at the same time, and if the Trading Advisor(s) of such Trading Company are unable to offset such futures interests positions, such Trading Company could lose all of its assets and the holders of Units of such Series would realize a 100% loss. The Managing Owner seeks to minimize market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions and the level of diversification of each Trading Advisor's portfolio. It is anticipated that any Trading Advisor's margin-to-equity ratio will typically not exceed approximately 35% although the actual ratio could be higher or lower from time to time.\nIn addition to market risk, trading futures forward and swap contracts entails credit risk which is the risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to a Trading Company. The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the U.S. and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. Some non-U.S. exchanges, in contrast to U.S. exchanges are principals' markets in which performance is the responsibility only of the individual counterparty with whom the Trading Company has entered into the transaction and not of the exchange or clearing corporation. In these kinds of markets, there is risk of bankruptcy or other failure or refusal to perform by the counterparty.\nIn the case of forward contracts traded on the interbank market and swaps, neither is traded on an exchange. The counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a group of financial institutions; thus, there may be a greater counterparty credit risk. The Managing Owner expects the Trading Advisors to trade only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of each Trading Company are valued each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to any Trading Company.\nThe Trust has entered into agreements, which provide for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, currency trading companies, and commodity trading advisers, among others, against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their individual obligations under such agreements, except for gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Trust has had no prior claims or payments pursuant to these agreements. The Trust's individual maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects the risk of loss to be remote.\nDisclosure of Contractual Obligations\nThe business of the Trust is the speculative trading of commodity interests. The majority of the Trust's futures and forward positions, which may be categorized as purchase obligations\u201d under Item 303 of Regulation S-K, are short-term. That is, they are held for less than one year. Because the Trust does not enter into other long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or other long-term liabilities that would otherwise be reflected on the Trust's Statement of Financial Condition, a table of contractual obligations has not been presented.\nResults of Operations for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021\nSeries Returns and Other Information\nThe returns for each Series and Class of Units for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, and related information, are discussed below. The activities of the Trust on a consolidated basis are explained through the activity of the underlying Series. Please refer to the discussion of the Series activities in relation to the Trust on a consolidated basis.\nEach Series had exposure to commodity interest positions within one or more sectors during fiscal 2021. The performance of each Series was impacted over the course of the year by, among other things, the relative performance of the relevant sector or sectors and the commodities within those sectors, the changing allocations among, and the specific positions taken by, the Series' Trading Advisors in, the relevant sector(s) and commodities, and the timing of entries and exits. For each of the Series, a sector attribution chart has been included at the end of the relevant discussion. Each chart depicts the performance of the relevant Series' positions within each of the relevant sectors (determined by the Managing Owner using monthly gross return and NAV figures, with various adjustments to net out a proportional allocation of the fees and expenses chargeable to the Series) during the fourth quarter (except as otherwise noted) and for the full calendar year.

The activities of the Trust on a consolidated basis are explained through the activity of the underlying Series. Please refer to the discussion of the Series activities in relation to the Trust on a consolidated basis.\nEach Series had exposure to commodity interest positions within one or more sectors during fiscal 2020. The performance of each Series was impacted over the course of the year by, among other things, the relative performance of the relevant sector or sectors and the commodities within those sectors, the changing allocations among, and the specific positions taken by, the Series' Trading Advisors in, the relevant sector(s) and commodities, and the timing of entries and exits. For each of the Series, a sector attribution chart has been included at the end of the relevant discussion. Each chart depicts the performance of the relevant Series' positions within each of the relevant sectors (determined by the Managing Owner using monthly gross return and NAV figures, with various adjustments to net out a proportional allocation of the fees and expenses chargeable to the Series) during the fourth quarter (except as otherwise noted) and for the full calendar year. Charts depicting the performance of the various Series' positions within each of the relevant sectors during the prior three quarters were included in the Trust's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q previously filed.\nDuring the periods covered by this report, for a Series that was invested in a swap, a trading advisor did not receive any management fees directly from the Series for such swap, and instead the relevant trading advisor received compensation via the fees embedded in the swap. In each case, the embedded management fee was accrued on the relevant notional amount of the swap.\nThe swaps owned by Frontier Heritage Fund and Frontier Select Fund (through its investment in an unconsolidated trading company) were terminated effective May 30, 2020, and the swaps owned by Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund and Frontier Diversified Fund were terminated effective December 21, 2020.\nFrontier Diversified Fund\nThe Frontier Diversified Fund - Class 1 NAV lost 28.11% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, net of fees and expenses; the Frontier Diversified Fund - Class 2 NAV lost 26.84% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, net of fees and expenses; the Frontier Diversified Fund - Class 3 NAV lost 26.65% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, net of fees and expenses.

The swap owned by the Frontier Diversified Fund was terminated effective December 21, 2020. To the extent that the Series invested in a swap, the swap referenced an index, consisting of the performance realized on the trading program of one or more commodity trading advisors. Such performance was net of management fees and incentive fees paid to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s), brokerage fees and certain other related fees and charges, and therefore these fees were said to be embedded.\nThe aggregate fees embedded in a swap were provided for in the index description for the relevant swap. In addition to the management fee and incentive fee for the commodity trading advisor(s) (the CTA Fees\u201d), each index provided for the deduction of a management fee to the counterparty for the swap. The counterparty management fee was determined based on the management fee spread set forth in the index description, while the CTA Fees were based on a percentage of the assets managed by each trading advisor and new trading profits, respectively, and were set forth in the reports delivered to the Series by the counterparty. In addition to the counterparty management fee and the CTA Fees, the underlying transactions executed by the commodity trading advisors may have been subject to the deduction of certain prime brokerage, exchange and other related fees and charges, each of which were reflected in the transaction values, and consequently the value of the index.\nThe management fees payable to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s) comprising the index referenced in the swaps was 1.00% per annum of notional assets. The incentive fees payable to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s) comprising the index referenced in the swaps ranged from 20% to 25% of new net trading profits on a monthly or quarterly basis. To the extent that there were embedded management fees and incentive fees incurred in a swap investment, the Managing Owner waived any management and incentive fees to which it was otherwise entitled. The management and incentive fees embedded in a swap may have been higher or lower than the management and incentive fees that would have otherwise been charged to a Series by the Managing Owner.\nDuring the periods covered by this report, the management fee embedded in swaps owned by Frontier Diversified Fund was 1.00% per annum, and the managing owner waived the entire management fee due to it from those Series in respect of such Series' investment in swaps. In each case, the embedded management fee was accrued on the relevant notional amount of the swap.\nBased on an analysis of the management fees charged to Frontier Diversified Fund, the effective management fee rate of the Series was higher than the management fee rate otherwise payable to the Managing Owner for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective management fee rate for the Series was calculated for the period covered by the Form 10-K by dividing the aggregate management fees paid by such Series (whether directly to the Managing Owner, or as an embedded management fee paid to a third-party commodity trading advisor) by the aggregate assets on which such management fees were paid. For the period ended December 31, 2020, the effective management fee rate of Frontier Diversified Fund was 0.78%, compared to a management fee payable to the Managing Owner of 0.75%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the management and incentive fees embedded in gains (losses) from trading companies owned by Frontier Diversified Fund was $27,253.\nThe Frontier Diversified Fund may have both long and short exposure to the Interest Rates, Currencies, Stock Indices, Energies, Metals and Commodities sectors.\nSector & Major Advisor Attribution for the Frontier Diversified Fund\n \nFour of the six sectors traded in the Frontier Diversified Fund were profitable in Q4 2020.

In each case, the embedded management fee was accrued on the relevant notional amount of the swap.\nBased on an analysis of the management fees charged to Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, the effective management fee rate of the Series was lower than the management fee rate otherwise payable to the Managing Owner for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective management fee rate for the Series was calculated for the period covered by the Form 10-K by dividing the aggregate management fees paid by such Series (whether directly to the Managing Owner, or as an embedded management fee paid to a third-party commodity trading advisor) by the aggregate assets on which such management fees were paid. For the period ended December 31, 2020, the effective management fee rate of Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund was 1.83%, compared to a management fee payable to the Managing Owner of 2.00%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the management and incentive fees embedded in gains (losses) from trading companies owned by Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund was $57,039.\nThe Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund may have both long and short exposure to the Interest Rates, Currencies, Stock Indices, Energies, Metals and Commodities sectors, although the majority of the exposure will typically be in the Energies, Metals and Commodities sectors.\nSector & Major Advisor Attribution for the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund\n \n \nAll of the seven sectors traded in the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund were profitable in Q4 2020.

The swap owned by the Frontier Balanced Fund was terminated effective December 21, 2020. To the extent that the Series invested in a swap, the swap referenced an index, consisting of the performance realized on the trading program of one or more commodity trading advisors. Such performance was net of management fees and incentive fees paid to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s), brokerage fees and certain other related fees and charges, and therefore these fees were said to be embedded.\nThe aggregate fees embedded in a swap were provided for in the index description for the relevant swap. In addition to the CTA Fees, each index provided for the deduction of a management fee to the counterparty for the swap. The counterparty management fee was determined based on the management fee spread set forth in the index description, while the CTA Fees were based on a percentage of the assets managed by each trading advisor and new trading profits, respectively, and were set forth in the reports delivered to the Series by the counterparty. In addition to the counterparty management fee and the CTA Fees, the underlying transactions executed by the commodity trading advisors may have been subject to the deduction of certain prime brokerage, exchange and other related fees and charges, each of which were reflected in the transaction values, and consequently the value of the index.\nThe management fees payable to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s) comprising the index referenced in the swaps was 1.00% per annum of notional assets. The incentive fees payable to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s) comprising the index referenced in the swaps ranged from 20% to 25% of new net trading profits on a monthly or quarterly basis. To the extent that there were embedded management fees and incentive fees incurred in a swap investment, the Managing Owner waived any management and incentive fees to which it was otherwise entitled.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nThe Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed on August 8, 2003. The Trust is a multi-advisor commodity pool, as described in CFTC Regulation \u00a7 4.10(d)(2). The Trust is authorized to issue multiple Series of Units, pursuant to the requirements of the Trust Act. The assets of each Series are held and accounted for in separate and distinct records separately from the assets of other Series. The Trust is managed by the Managing Owner, and its term will expire on December 31, 2053 (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances).\nThe Trust, with respect to each Series of Units, engages in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forward (including interbank foreign currencies) and options contracts and other derivative instruments (including swaps). The Trust allocates funds to affiliated Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities, each of which has one-year renewable contracts with its own independent Trading Advisor(s) that will manage all or a portion of the applicable Trading Company's or Galaxy Plus entity's assets, and make the trading decisions for the assets of each Series vested in such Trading Company or Galaxy Plus entity. The assets of each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity will be segregated from the assets of each other Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity. The Trust has an investment objective of increasing the value of the Units over the long term (capital appreciation), while controlling risk and volatility; further, to offer exposure to the investment programs of individual Trading Advisors and to specific instruments (currencies). For additional overview of the Trust's structure and business activities, see Item 1 BUSINESS.\u201d For a discussion of fees paid by the Trust, see Item 11 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires the Managing Owner to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust's most significant accounting policy, described below, includes the valuation of its futures and forward contracts, options contracts, swap contracts, U.S. Treasury securities and investments in unconsolidated Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities. The majority of these investments are exchange traded contracts valued upon exchange settlement prices or non-exchange traded contracts and obligations with valuation based on third-party quoted dealer values on the Interbank market.\nThe Trust's other significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2 of the financial statements.\nInvestment Transactions and Valuation\nThe Managing Owner has evaluated the nature and type of transactions processed and estimates that it makes in preparing the Trust's financial statements and related disclosures and has adopted Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, and implemented the framework for measuring fair value for assets and liabilities.\nThe Trust utilizes valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach per the requirement of ASC 820 for the valuation of futures (exchange traded) contracts, forward (non-exchange traded) contracts, option contracts, swap contracts and other non-cash assets. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The Trust applies the valuation techniques in a consistent manner for each asset or liability. The Trust records all investments at fair value in its Statements of Financial Condition, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net gain/(loss) on investments in the Statements of Operations.\nInputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. Inputs may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the financial asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources, or unobservable, meaning those that reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the financial asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nIn addition, the Trust monitors counterparty credit risk and incorporates any identified risk factors when assigning input levels to underlying financial assets or liabilities. In that regard ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. A full disclosure of the fair value hierarchy is presented in Note 3 of the financial statements-Fair Value Measurements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Trust will raise additional capital only through the sale of Units offered pursuant to the continuing offering and does not intend to raise any capital through borrowing. Due to the nature of the Trust's business, it makes no capital expenditures and has no capital assets that are not operating capital or assets.\nThe Managing Owner is responsible for the payment of all of the ordinary expenses associated with the organization of the Trust and the offering of each Series of Units, except for the initial and ongoing service fee, if any, and no Series will be required to reimburse these expenses. As a result, 100% of each Series' offering proceeds are initially available for that Series' trading activities.\nA portion of each Trading Company's assets is used as margin to maintain that Trading Company's forward currency contract positions, and another portion is deposited in cash in segregated accounts in the name of each Trading Company maintained for each Trading Company at the clearing brokers in accordance with CFTC segregation requirements. At December 31, 2021, cash deposited at the clearing brokers was $801,700 for the Trust. The clearing brokers are expected to credit each Trading Company with approximately 80%-100% of the interest earned on its average net assets on deposit with the clearing brokers each month. Currently, with the Federal Funds target rate at 0.00 to 0.25%, this amount is estimated to be 0.00%. In an attempt to increase interest income earned, the Managing Owner also may invest the non-margin assets in U.S. government securities which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S., or by a person controlled by or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the government of the U.S. pursuant to authority granted by Congress or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing, including U.S. Treasury bonds, U.S. Treasury bills and issues of agencies of the U.S. government, and certain cash items such as money market funds and time deposits. Aggregate interest income from all sources, including US Treasury Securities assets net of premiums and cash held at clearing brokers, of up to 2% (annualized) is paid to the Managing Owner by the Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1 and Class 2 only), Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 2 and Class 3), Frontier Global Fund, Frontier Select Fund and Frontier Heritage Fund. For the Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 2a and Class 3a), Frontier Masters Fund and Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a), 100% of the interest is retained by the respective Series. The amount reflected in the financial statements for the Trust and Series are disclosed on a net basis. Due to some classes not exceeding the 2% paid to the Managing Owner, amounts earned by those classes may be zero.\nApproximately 70% to 90% of the Trust's assets are expected to be committed as required margin for futures contracts and forwards and options trading and held by the respective broker, although the amount committed may vary significantly. Such assets are maintained in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury bills in segregated accounts with the futures broker pursuant to the CEA and regulations there under. The remaining approximately 10% to 30% of the Trust's assets will normally be invested in cash equivalents and short-term investments, such as money market funds and time deposits and held by the clearing broker, the over-the-counter counterparties and by U.S. federally chartered banks. As of December 31, 2021, total cash and cash equivalents held at banking institutions were $165,491 for the Frontier Diversified Fund, $40,528 for the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, $76,703 for the Frontier Masters Fund, $188,010 for the Frontier Balanced Fund, $51,140 for the Frontier Select Fund, $128,021 for the Frontier Global Fund, and $48,839 for the Frontier Heritage Fund.\nAs a commodity pool, the Trust has large cash positions. Such cash positions are used to pay margin for the trading of futures, forwards and options, and also to pay redemptions. Generally, the Trust has not been forced to liquidate positions to fund redemptions. As of December 31, 2021, the redemptions payable were $20,299 for the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, $20,382 for the Frontier Balanced Fund and $27,561 for the Frontier Global Fund During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Trust was able to pay all redemptions on a timely basis.\nOff-Balance Sheet Risk\nThe term off-balance sheet risk\u201d refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. Each Trading Company trades in futures, forward and swap contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts there exists a market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions held by a Trading Company in respect of any Series at the same time, and if the Trading Advisor(s) of such Trading Company are unable to offset such futures interests positions, such Trading Company could lose all of its assets and the holders of Units of such Series would realize a 100% loss. The Managing Owner seeks to minimize market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions and the level of diversification of each Trading Advisor's portfolio. It is anticipated that any Trading Advisor's margin-to-equity ratio will typically not exceed approximately 35% although the actual ratio could be higher or lower from time to time.\nIn addition to market risk, trading futures forward and swap contracts entails credit risk which is the risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to a Trading Company. The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the U.S. and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. Some non-U.S. exchanges, in contrast to U.S. exchanges are principals' markets in which performance is the responsibility only of the individual counterparty with whom the Trading Company has entered into the transaction and not of the exchange or clearing corporation. In these kinds of markets, there is risk of bankruptcy or other failure or refusal to perform by the counterparty.\nIn the case of forward contracts traded on the interbank market and swaps, neither is traded on an exchange. The counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a group of financial institutions; thus, there may be a greater counterparty credit risk. The Managing Owner expects the Trading Advisors to trade only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of each Trading Company are valued each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to any Trading Company.\nThe Trust has entered into agreements, which provide for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, currency trading companies, and commodity trading advisers, among others, against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their individual obligations under such agreements, except for gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Trust has had no prior claims or payments pursuant to these agreements. The Trust's individual maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects the risk of loss to be remote.\nDisclosure of Contractual Obligations\nThe business of the Trust is the speculative trading of commodity interests. The majority of the Trust's futures and forward positions, which may be categorized as purchase obligations\u201d under Item 303 of Regulation S-K, are short-term. That is, they are held for less than one year. Because the Trust does not enter into other long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or other long-term liabilities that would otherwise be reflected on the Trust's Statement of Financial Condition, a table of contractual obligations has not been presented.\nResults of Operations for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021\nSeries Returns and Other Information\nThe returns for each Series and Class of Units for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, and related information, are discussed below. The activities of the Trust on a consolidated basis are explained through the activity of the underlying Series. Please refer to the discussion of the Series activities in relation to the Trust on a consolidated basis.\nEach Series had exposure to commodity interest positions within one or more sectors during fiscal 2021. The performance of each Series was impacted over the course of the year by, among other things, the relative performance of the relevant sector or sectors and the commodities within those sectors, the changing allocations among, and the specific positions taken by, the Series' Trading Advisors in, the relevant sector(s) and commodities, and the timing of entries and exits. For each of the Series, a sector attribution chart has been included at the end of the relevant discussion.

The activities of the Trust on a consolidated basis are explained through the activity of the underlying Series. Please refer to the discussion of the Series activities in relation to the Trust on a consolidated basis.\nEach Series had exposure to commodity interest positions within one or more sectors during fiscal 2020. The performance of each Series was impacted over the course of the year by, among other things, the relative performance of the relevant sector or sectors and the commodities within those sectors, the changing allocations among, and the specific positions taken by, the Series' Trading Advisors in, the relevant sector(s) and commodities, and the timing of entries and exits. For each of the Series, a sector attribution chart has been included at the end of the relevant discussion. Each chart depicts the performance of the relevant Series' positions within each of the relevant sectors (determined by the Managing Owner using monthly gross return and NAV figures, with various adjustments to net out a proportional allocation of the fees and expenses chargeable to the Series) during the fourth quarter (except as otherwise noted) and for the full calendar year. Charts depicting the performance of the various Series' positions within each of the relevant sectors during the prior three quarters were included in the Trust's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q previously filed.\nDuring the periods covered by this report, for a Series that was invested in a swap, a trading advisor did not receive any management fees directly from the Series for such swap, and instead the relevant trading advisor received compensation via the fees embedded in the swap. In each case, the embedded management fee was accrued on the relevant notional amount of the swap.\nThe swaps owned by Frontier Heritage Fund and Frontier Select Fund (through its investment in an unconsolidated trading company) were terminated effective May 30, 2020, and the swaps owned by Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund and Frontier Diversified Fund were terminated effective December 21, 2020.\nFrontier Diversified Fund\nThe Frontier Diversified Fund - Class 1 NAV lost 28.11% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, net of fees and expenses; the Frontier Diversified Fund - Class 2 NAV lost 26.84% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, net of fees and expenses; the Frontier Diversified Fund - Class 3 NAV lost 26.65% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, net of fees and expenses.

The swap owned by the Frontier Diversified Fund was terminated effective December 21, 2020. To the extent that the Series invested in a swap, the swap referenced an index, consisting of the performance realized on the trading program of one or more commodity trading advisors. Such performance was net of management fees and incentive fees paid to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s), brokerage fees and certain other related fees and charges, and therefore these fees were said to be embedded.\nThe aggregate fees embedded in a swap were provided for in the index description for the relevant swap. In addition to the management fee and incentive fee for the commodity trading advisor(s) (the CTA Fees\u201d), each index provided for the deduction of a management fee to the counterparty for the swap. The counterparty management fee was determined based on the management fee spread set forth in the index description, while the CTA Fees were based on a percentage of the assets managed by each trading advisor and new trading profits, respectively, and were set forth in the reports delivered to the Series by the counterparty. In addition to the counterparty management fee and the CTA Fees, the underlying transactions executed by the commodity trading advisors may have been subject to the deduction of certain prime brokerage, exchange and other related fees and charges, each of which were reflected in the transaction values, and consequently the value of the index.\nThe management fees payable to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s) comprising the index referenced in the swaps was 1.00% per annum of notional assets. The incentive fees payable to the underlying commodity trading advisor(s) comprising the index referenced in the swaps ranged from 20% to 25% of new net trading profits on a monthly or quarterly basis. To the extent that there were embedded management fees and incentive fees incurred in a swap investment, the Managing Owner waived any management and incentive fees to which it was otherwise entitled. The management and incentive fees embedded in a swap may have been higher or lower than the management and incentive fees that would have otherwise been charged to a Series by the Managing Owner.\nDuring the periods covered by this report, the management fee embedded in swaps owned by Frontier Diversified Fund was 1.00% per annum, and the managing owner waived the entire management fee due to it from those Series in respect of such Series' investment in swaps. In each case, the embedded management fee was accrued on the relevant notional amount of the swap.\nBased on an analysis of the management fees charged to Frontier Diversified Fund, the effective management fee rate of the Series was higher than the management fee rate otherwise payable to the Managing Owner for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective management fee rate for the Series was calculated for the period covered by the Form 10-K by dividing the aggregate management fees paid by such Series (whether directly to the Managing Owner, or as an embedded management fee paid to a third-party commodity trading advisor) by the aggregate assets on which such management fees were paid. For the period ended December 31, 2020, the effective management fee rate of Frontier Diversified Fund was 0.78%, compared to a management fee payable to the Managing Owner of 0.75%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the management and incentive fees embedded in gains (losses) from trading companies owned by Frontier Diversified Fund was $27,253.\nThe Frontier Diversified Fund may have both long and short exposure to the Interest Rates, Currencies, Stock Indices, Energies, Metals and Commodities sectors.\nSector & Major Advisor Attribution for the Frontier Diversified Fund\n \nFour of the six sectors traded in the Frontier Diversified Fund were profitable in Q4 2020.
