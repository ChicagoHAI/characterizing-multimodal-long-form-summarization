Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \u2018\u2018Risk Factors'' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results or timing of certain events could differ materially from the results or timing described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a precision therapy company focused on genomically defined cancers, rare diseases and cancer immunotherapy. Our approach is to leverage our novel target discovery engine to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases and to craft highly selective and potent therapies that may provide significant and durable clinical responses for patients without adequate treatment options. This integrated biology and chemistry approach enables us to identify, characterize and design drug candidates to inhibit novel kinase targets that have been difficult to selectively inhibit. We believe that our uniquely targeted, scalable approach empowers the rapid design and development of new treatments and increases the likelihood of success. We have one precision therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and are currently advancing multiple investigational medicines in clinical development, along with multiple research programs.\nAvapritinib and BLU-263 - Systemic Mastocytosis and other Mast Cell Disorders\nAvapritinib\nWe are developing avapritinib for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis, or SM, a rare disorder that causes an overproduction of mast cells and the accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs, which can lead to a wide range of debilitating symptoms and organ dysfunction and failure. Nearly all cases of SM are driven by the KIT D816V mutation, which aberrantly activates mast cells.\nWe are currently evaluating avapritinib in an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our EXPLORER trial, an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our PATHFINDER trial, and an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in indolent and smoldering SM, which we refer to as our PIONEER trial. We plan to present updated data from the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials in the second half of 2020. In December 2019, we reported initial data from the dose-finding portion (part 1) of the PIONEER trial at the 61st American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition, or ASH annual meeting. We plan to report updated data from part 1 of the PIONEER trial in a late-breaking oral presentation on March 14, 2020 at the annual meeting for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, or AAAAI annual meeting. Based on these data, we expect to initiate patient screening in part 2 of the PIONEER trial in the second quarter of 2020 and complete enrollment by the end of 2020.\nWe plan to submit a supplemental new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for avapritinib for the treatment of advanced SM in the second half of 2020, which we anticipate will be focused on data from patients in the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials who were treated with avapritinib at a starting dose of 200 mg once daily, or QD, supported by pooled data from all doses. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of mastocytosis, and the European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation to avapritinib for the treatment of mastocytosis. In addition, the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to avapritinib for the treatment of advanced SM, including the subtypes of aggressive SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm and mast cell leukemia.\nBLU-263\nWe are developing BLU-263 for the treatment of indolent SM and other mast cell disorders. BLU-263 is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective KIT inhibitor currently in the discovery stage. BLU-263 is\ndesigned to have equivalent potency as avapritinib, improved selectivity for KIT, with low off-target activity, and lower penetration of the central nervous system relative to avapritinib based on preclinical data, which we believe will enable development of BLU-263 in a broad population of patients with indolent SM, including patients with lower disease burden requiring potentially life-long chronic therapy, as well as patients with other KIT-driven mast cell disorders. We plan to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, for BLU-263 for indolent SM and initiate a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2020.\nPralsetinib - RET-altered Cancers\nWe are developing pralsetinib for the treatment of RET-altered non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, medullary thyroid carcinoma, or MTC, and other solid tumors. Pralsetinib is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase. Pralsetinib is designed to inhibit the activating RET fusions and mutations that drive cancer growth and remain active in the presence of resistance mutations that we predict will arise from treatment with first generation therapies. RET activating fusions and mutations drive disease in subsets of patients with NSCLC, and cancers of the thyroid, including MTC and papillary thyroid cancer, or PTC, and our research suggests that RET may drive disease in subsets of patients with colon cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and other cancers.\nWe are currently evaluating pralsetinib in an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with RET-altered NSCLC, MTC and other advanced solid tumors, which we refer to as our ARROW trial. In January 2020, we reported top-line data from the ARROW trial in RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients treated with pralsetinib at 400 mg QD. We plan to report top-line data from the ARROW trial in RET-mutant MTC patients in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we plan to present the registration data from the ARROW trial of pralsetinib in RET fusion-positive NSCLC and RET-mutant MTC in 2020. We recently announced the activation of the first trial site for our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating pralsetinib in patients with first-line RET fusion-positive NSCLC, which we refer to as our AcceleRET Lung trial, and we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of pralsetinib in first-line RET-mutant MTC in the second half of 2020.\nIn January 2020, we initiated the submission of a rolling NDA to the FDA for the treatment of patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC, and we expect to complete the submission in the first quarter of 2020. We plan to submit an NDA to the FDA for pralsetinib for the treatment of patients with MTC previously treated with an approved multi-kinase inhibitor in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we plan to submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for pralsetinib for RET fusion-positive NSCLC in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe FDA has granted orphan drug designation to pralsetinib for the treatment of RET-rearranged NSCLC, JAK1/2-positive NSCLC or TRKC-positive NSCLC, and the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to pralsetinib for the treatment of patients with RET-fusion positive NSCLC that has progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy and to pralsetinib for the treatment of patients with RET mutation-positive MTC that requires systemic treatment and for which there are no acceptable alternative treatments.\nAvapritinib - Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors\nWe are also developing avapritinib for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or GIST, a rare disease that is a sarcoma, or tumor of bone or connective tissue, of the gastrointestinal tract. Avapritinib is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets KIT and PDGFRA mutations. These mutations abnormally activate receptor tyrosine kinases that are drivers of GIST.\nIn January 2020, the FDA granted approval of avapritinib under the brand name AYVAKIT for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. The efficacy of AYVAKIT was established from 43 patients in the NAVIGATOR trial with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring PDGFRA exon 18 mutations, including 38 patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations. The safety of AYVAKIT in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST was evaluated in 204 patients who received 300 mg QD or 400 mg QD dosing in the NAVIGATOR trial.\nWe are also developing avapritinib for the treatment of third-line and later GIST (including fourth-line GIST). We are currently evaluating avapritinib for the treatment of GIST in an ongoing registration-enabling global, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial comparing avapritinib to regorafenib in third-line GIST, which we refer to as our VOYAGER trial. The FDA is currently reviewing our NDA for avapritinib for the treatment of fourth-line GIST, and this application has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, action date of May 14, 2020. As part of the review, the FDA has requested top-line data from our VOYAGER trial. We expect to provide the top-line data to the FDA early in the second quarter of 2020 to enable the FDA to take action by the PDUFA action date and we also expect to report the top-line data in the second quarter of 2020.\nBased on data from the VOYAGER trial, we plan to submit a supplemental NDA to the FDA for avapritinib for the treatment of third-line GIST in the second half of 2020. In addition, the EMA is currently reviewing our MAA for the treatment of adult patients with PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST, regardless of prior therapy, and we anticipate a decision from the European Commission in the third quarter of 2020. We plan to pursue an MAA for third-line and later GIST (including fourth-line GIST) based on data from our VOYAGER trial.\nThe FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to avapritinib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The FDA has also granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST and fast track designation to avapritinib for (i) the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST that progressed following treatment with imatinib and a second tyrosine kinase inhibitor and (ii) the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST with the PDGFRA D842V mutation regardless of prior therapy. In addition, the European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST.\nFisogatinib - Hepatocellular Carcinoma\nWe are developing fisogatinib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC. Fisogatinib is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets FGFR4, a kinase that is aberrantly activated in a defined subset of patients with HCC, the most common type of liver cancer. We are currently evaluating fisogatinib in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced HCC. As part of our collaboration with CStone Pharmaceuticals, or CStone, we are also evaluating fisogatinib in combination with CS1001, a clinical-stage anti-PDL1 immunotherapy being developed by CStone, for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic HCC in an ongoing Phase 1b/2 trial conducted in multiple clinical sites in China. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to fisogatinib for the treatment of HCC.\nDiscovery Platform\nWe plan to continue to leverage our discovery platform to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases in genomically defined patient populations and craft drug candidates that potently and selectively target these kinases. In January 2020, we announced the nomination of a development candidate for the treatment of EGFR Exon 19/L858R+T790M+C797S, which we refer to as resistant EGFR-positive triple mutant NSCLC. Following this nomination, we currently have five wholly-owned discovery programs, consisting of the following: BLU-263; the development candidate for the treatment of resistant EGFR-positive triple mutant NSCLC; a pre-development candidate program targeting EGFR Exon 19/L858R+C797S, which we refer to as resistant EGFR-positive double mutant NSCLC; and two pre-development candidate programs for undisclosed kinase targets. EGFR Exon 19/L858R+T790M+C797S and EGFR Exon 19/L858R+C797S are acquired resistance mutations in NSCLC patients following treatment with osimertinib. We plan to nominate up to two additional development candidates by the end of 2020.\nDevelopment and Commercialization Rights\nWe currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to avapritinib, pralsetinib and fisogatinib, other than the rights licensed to CStone for these drug candidates in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or the CStone territory. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our discovery programs, other than the discovery-stage cancer immunotherapy programs under collaboration with F.\nHoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., which we collectively refer to as Roche, and BLU-782, which is licensed to Clementia Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Clementia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ipsen S.A .\nCollaborations and Licenses\nRoche. We entered into a collaboration with Roche in March 2016. Under our collaboration agreement with Roche, we are working with Roche to discover, develop and commercialize up to four small molecule therapeutics targeting kinases believed to be important in cancer immunotherapy, as single products or possibly in combination with other therapeutics. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we and Roche announced one of the kinase targets under the collaboration, MAP4K1, which is believed to play a role in T cell regulation.\nCStone. We entered into a collaboration with CStone in June 2018. Under our collaboration agreement with CStone, we are seeking to develop and commercialize avapritinib, pralsetinib and fisogatinib, including back-up forms and certain other forms, in the CStone territory either as a monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy.\nClementia. In October 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Clementia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ipsen S.A., and granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to Clementia to develop and commercialize BLU-782, as well as specified other compounds related to the BLU-782 program. BLU-782 is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets mutant activin-like kinase 2, or ALK2, in development for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP. Clementia is planning to commence a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of BLU-782 for the treatment of FOP in 2020 as a monotherapy. The FDA has granted a rare pediatric disease designation, orphan drug designation and fast track designation to BLU-782, each for the treatment of FOP.\nWe will continue to evaluate additional collaborations, partnerships and licenses that could maximize the value for our programs and allow us to leverage the expertise of strategic collaborators, partners and licensors, including in additional geographies where we may not have current operations or expertise. We are also focused on engaging in collaborations, partnerships and license agreements to capitalize on our discovery platform outside of our primary strategic focus area of cancer and rare diseases.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, private placements of our convertible preferred stock, collaborations and a debt financing. Through December 31, 2019, we have received an aggregate of $1.5 billion from such transactions, including $1.2 billion in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in our May 2015 initial public offering, or IPO, and December 2016, April 2017, December 2017 and April 2019 follow-on public offerings, $115.1 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, $18.8 million in upfront and milestone payments under our former collaboration with Alexion Pharma Holding, or Alexion, $63.0 million in upfront and milestone payments under our collaboration with Roche, $50.0 million upfront and milestone payments under our collaboration with CStone, a $25.0 million upfront payment under our license agreement with Clementia and $10.0 million in gross proceeds from a debt financing. In addition, we received $308.2 million in estimated net proceeds from our January 2020 follow-on public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $347.6 million, $236.6 million and $148.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $945.2 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>continue to advance and initiate clinical development activities for avapritinib, pralsetinib, fisogatinib and BLU-263; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>seek marketing approval for avapritinib in additional geographies and indications and marketing approvals for other drug candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>maintain and expand our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>continue to manufacture increasing quantities of drug substance and drug product material for use in pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and commercialization; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>continue to discover, validate and develop additional drug candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>conduct research and development activities under our collaborations with Roche and CStone; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>conduct development and commercialization activities for companion diagnostic tests for AYVAKIT and current or future drug candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>acquire or in-license other drug, drug candidates or technologies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>hire additional research, clinical, quality, manufacturing, regulatory, commercial and general and administrative personnel; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nAs of December 31, 2019, our revenue consists of collaboration revenue under our collaborations with Roche and CStone, including amounts that are recognized related to upfront payments, milestone payments and amounts due to us for research and development services, and license revenue under our license agreement with Clementia.\nIn January 2020, the FDA granted approval of avapritinib under the brand name AYVAKIT for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations, and we have commenced the sale of AYVAKIT in the U.S. As a result, we will generate revenue from sales of AYVAKIT in 2020. In the future, we expect to generate revenue from a combination of sales of our approved drugs, royalties on drug sales and cost reimbursements, as well as upfront, milestone, royalty and other payments, if any, under any current or future collaborations and licenses, including revenues related to the supply of our drug candidates or approved drugs to CStone for development and commercialization activities in the CStone territory. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of product sales, license fees, research and development services and related reimbursements, payments for manufacturing services, and option fees, milestone payments or other payments under our collaboration or license agreements, if any.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research and development activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our drug candidates, which include:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>expenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development, pre-clinical activities, clinical activities and manufacturing on our behalf; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>expenses incurred under agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of companion diagnostic tests; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the cost of consultants; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the cost associated with regulatory quality assurance and quality control operations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the cost of lab supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing pre-clinical study materials, clinical trial materials and commercial supply materials; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other operating costs in support of research and development activities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nThe successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. As such, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of these drug candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our drug candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>successful enrollment in, and completion of clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for AYVAKIT and our drug candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>commercializing AYVAKIT and our drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>market acceptance of AYVAKIT and any future drug we may commercialize; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our drug candidate development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. In addition, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.\nA significant portion of our research and development expenses have been external expenses, which we track on a program-by-program basis following nomination as a development candidate. Our internal research and development expenses are primarily personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense. Except\nfor internal research and development expenses related to collaboration agreements, we do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they are deployed across multiple projects under development.\nThe following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Other development and pre-development candidate expenses, unallocated expenses and internal research and development expenses have been classified separately.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Avapritinib external expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 98,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 83,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 46,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pralsetinib external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fisogatinib external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BLU-263 external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other development and pre-development candidate expenses and unallocated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 331,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 243,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 144,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we expand our operations and incur additional costs in connection with our clinical trials and preparing regulatory filings. These increases will likely include the costs related to the implementation and expansion of clinical trial sites and related patient enrollment, monitoring, program management and manufacturing expenses for API, drug product and drug substance for current and future clinical trials and commercial inventory. In addition, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we incur additional costs in connection with research and development activities under our collaboration with Roche, development activities under our collaboration with CStone and development activities for companion diagnostic tests for current and future drug candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, commercial, business development, information technology, legal and human resources functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, pre-commercial development activities, legal fees related to intellectual property and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future to support additional research and development activities and commercialization activities, including expanding our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any drugs for which we may obtain marketing approval in additional indications or geographies and expanding our operations in the U.S. and outside the U.S. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, legal, auditing and filing fees and general compliance and consulting expenses, among other expenses. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company and expanding the scope of our operations.\nInterest Income (Expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of income earned on cash equivalents and investments.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies are those policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements. Management has determined that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses, available-for-sale investments, stock-based compensation and leases.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we refer to as ASC 606, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. We only applied the modified retrospective transition method to contracts that were not completed as January 1, 2018, the effective date of adoption for ASC 606. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe enter into licensing agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which we may exclusively license rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our drug and drug candidates to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; reimbursement of certain costs; customer option exercise fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.\nIn determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under our agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: (a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above; (b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and (c) the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties and sales-based milestones, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance\nobligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.\nExclusive Licenses. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a promise or performance obligation is distinct from the other promises, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a promise for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise, whether the value of the promise is dependent on the unsatisfied promise, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nResearch and Development Services. The promises under our collaboration agreements may include research and development services to be performed by our employees on behalf of the partner. Payments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts are recognized as the services are performed and presented on a gross basis because we are the principal for such efforts. Reimbursements from and payments to the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.\nCustomer Options. If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options that are not determined to be material rights are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised.\nMilestone Payments. At the inception of each arrangement that includes research or development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we reevaluate the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nRoyalties. For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments upon first commercial sales and milestone payments based on a level of sales, which are the result of a customer-vendor\nrelationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\nCollaborative Arrangements. We analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities and therefore within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, which we refer to as ASC 808. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and which elements of the collaboration are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. Amounts that are owed to collaboration partners are recognized as an offset to collaboration revenues as such amounts are incurred by the collaboration partner. Where amounts owed to a collaboration partner exceed our collaboration revenues in each quarterly period, such amounts are classified as research and development expense. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above under ASC 606.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nAvailable-for-Sale Investments\nWe classify marketable securities with a remaining maturity when purchased of greater than three months as available-for-sale. Marketable securities with a remaining maturity date greater than one year are classified as non-current. Available-for-sale securities are maintained by an investment manager and may consist of U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. government agency securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity until\nrealized. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income and/or expense over the life of the instrument. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense). If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in value of the investment, we consider all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other-than-temporary\u201d and, if so, mark the investment to market through a charge to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation -Stock Compensation, which we refer to as ASC 718. We expense the fair value of stock-based awards granted to employees and members of the board of directors over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period. Compensation cost for stock-based awards issued to employees is measured using the estimated fair value at the grant date and is adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures. We estimate the fair value of options granted to employees at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that requires management to apply judgment and make estimates, including:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>expected volatility, which is calculated based on reported volatility data for a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. For these analyses, we select companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We intend to consistently apply this process using representative companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>expected term, which we calculate using the simplified method, as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, as we have insufficient historical information regarding our stock options to provide a basis for an estimate. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the contractual term of ten years and the weighted-average vesting term of the stock options, taking into consideration multiple vesting tranches; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>dividend yield, which is zero based on the fact that we never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock-based awards issued to non-employees, including directors for non-board-related services, are accounted for based on the fair value of such services received or of the intrinsic value of equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured. The measurement date for non-employee awards is the date of grant. Stock-based awards subject to service-based vesting conditions are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\nThe purchase price of common stock under our 2015 employee stock purchase plan, as amended, or 2015 ESPP, is equal to 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value per share of the common stock on the first business day of an offering period and (ii) the fair market value per share of the common stock on the purchase date. The fair value of the discounted purchases made under our 2015 ESPP is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of the look-back provision plus the 15% discount is recognized as compensation expense over the 180-day purchase period.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 84), which we refer to as ASC 842, which requires the recognition of the right-of-use assets and related operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet.\nWe adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at January 1, 2019. The adoption of ASC 842 had a substantial impact on our consolidated balance sheet and no impact to our consolidated statements of operations. Upon adoption of ASC 842, we recognized an adjustment of $54.2 million and $74.1 million to operating lease right-of-use assets and the related lease liabilities, respectively. The operating lease liabilities are based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments discounted using our secured incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of January 1, 2019.\nFor contracts entered into on or after the effective date, at the inception of a contract, we assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether we have the right to direct the use of the asset. At inception of a lease, we allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments.\nLeases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria are met: the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset or the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any of these criteria.\nFor all leases at the lease commencement date, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability are recognized. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred if any, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our secured incremental borrowing rate for the same term as the underlying lease.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: the fixed noncancelable lease payments, payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal period will be exercised, and payments for early termination options unless it is reasonably certain the lease will not be terminated early.\nLease cost for operating leases consists of the lease payments plus any initial direct costs, primarily brokerage commissions, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Included in lease cost are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that are not included in the initial lease liability and lease payments incurred in the period for any leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Lease cost for finance leases consists of the amortization of the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense determined on an amortized cost basis. The lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense.\nWe made an accounting policy election to not recognize leases with an initial term of 12 months or less within our consolidated balance sheets and to recognize those lease payments on a straight-line basis in our consolidated statements of income over the lease term.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 66,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 44,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 21,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 331,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 243,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 427,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 291,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 136,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (180)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (347,694)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (236,642)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 111,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Collaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue increased by $22.0 million from $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to the CStone, Roche and Clementia agreements. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to the CStone and Roche agreements. We recorded $12.1 million and $40.0 million revenue under the CStone agreement for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Collaboration revenue related to the CStone agreement for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $12.0 million in milestone revenue related to several development and regulatory milestones that were achieved during the year and $0.1 million related to drug supply for territory specific trials. Collaboration revenue related to the CStone agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of a $40.0 million upfront payment was recognized upon the execution of the CStone collaboration agreement. We recorded $8.2 million and $4.5 million revenue under the Roche agreement for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily related to amortization of the total upfront and milestone payments received as of such periods. We recorded $46.2 million revenue under the Clementia license agreement for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of a $25.0 million upfront payment received, a $20.0 million cash milestone payment due in the third quarter of 2020 and a $1.2 million inventory transfer.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $87.8 million from $243.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $331.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to the following:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>approximately $35.3 million in increased expenses for external clinical activities related to avapritinib, pralsetinib and BLU-782; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>approximately $31.3 million in increased personnel expense, primarily due to an increase in headcount, which was driven by growth in the clinical and manufacturing organizations and an increase of $11.6 million in stock-based compensation expense; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>approximately $15.1 million in increased expenses associated with clinical and commercial manufacturing activities; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>approximately $6.1 million in increased expenses associated with continuing to build our discovery platform and advance our discovery pipeline. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $48.5 million from $47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $96.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily related to increased costs and personnel expenses, including an increase of $12.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, associated with building our commercial infrastructure and to support the overall growth of our business.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net increased by $3.2 million from $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to higher average investment balances and a higher rate of return on investments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, decreased by less than $0.1 million from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 44,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 21,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 23,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 243,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 144,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 291,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 172,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 230\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (180)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (76)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 232\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (236,642)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (148,119)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 88,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Collaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue increased by $23.1 million from $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to the CStone and Roche agreements. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was related to the Roche and Alexion agreements. We entered into the CStone agreement on June 1, 2018 and recorded collaboration revenue of $40.0 million under the CStone agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018. We recorded $4.5 million and $5.2 million in collaboration revenue under the Roche agreement for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 and the resulting change in the revenue recognition pattern. We recorded collaboration revenue of\n$16.2 million under the Alexion agreement for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result of the termination of the Alexion agreement during 2017, we did not recognize any revenue under the Alexion agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $98.9 million from $144.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $243.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to the following:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>approximately $35.3 million in increased expenses for external clinical activities related to avapritinib and pralsetinib; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>approximately $27.5 million in increased personnel expense, primarily due to an increase in headcount, which was driven by growth in the clinical and manufacturing organizations as we advance our drug candidates and an increase of $10.7 million in stock-based compensation expense; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>approximately $27.3 million in increased expenses associated with clinical and commercial manufacturing activities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>approximately $5.6 million in increased expenses associated with continuing to build our discovery platform and advance our discovery pipeline; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>approximately $2.8 million in increased toxicology studies, including expenses associated with pre-clinical studies, including IND-enabling studies, related to BLU-782. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $19.9 million from $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily related to the following:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>approximately $11.1 million in increased personnel expenses, primarily due to an increase in general and administrative headcount to support our overall growth and including an increase of $7.3 million in stock-based compensation expense; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>approximately $6.1 million in increased professional fees, including pre-commercial planning activities; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>approximately $2.1 million in increased facility costs related to our new headquarters in 2018. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net increased by $7.4 million from $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to higher average investment balances and a higher rate of return on investments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, increased by $0.1 million from $0.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $0.2 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, private placements of our convertible preferred stock, collaborations, a license agreement and a debt financing.\nThrough December 31, 2019, we have received an aggregate of $1.5 billion from such transactions, including $1.2 billion in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in our May 2015 IPO and December 2016, April 2017, December 2017 and April 2019 follow-on public offerings, $115.1 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, $18.8 million in upfront and milestone payments from Alexion, $63.0 million in upfront and milestone payments from Roche, $50.0 million in upfront and milestone payments from CStone, a $25.0 million in upfront payment from Clementia and $10.0 million in gross proceeds from a debt financing.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $548.0 million. In addition, we received $308.2 million in estimated net proceeds from our January 2020 follow-on public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (278,015)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (175,009)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (119,865)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,466)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (161,088)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72,347)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 340,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 543,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 46,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (331,643)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 351,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net Cash Used in Operating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, the $103.0 million increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the increase in net loss during this period of $110.0 million, which was driven by increased payroll and payroll-related expenses and spending on pre-clinical, clinical and pre-commercial activities, partially offset by upfront and milestone payments received during year ended December 31, 2019. The net cash flows provided by operating activities for year ended December 31, 2019 reflect a $25.0 million upfront payment received under the Clementia agreement, an aggregate of $10.0 million in milestone payments received under the CStone agreement and an $8.0 million milestone payment received under the Roche agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the $55.1 million increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the increase in net loss during this period of $88.5 million, which was driven by increased payroll and payroll-related expenses and spending on pre-clinical, clinical and pre-commercial activities, partially offset by upfront and milestone payments received during year ended December 31, 2018. The net cash flows provided by operating activities for year ended December 31, 2018 reflect a $40.0 million upfront payment received under the CStone agreement and a $10.0 milestone payment received under the Roche agreement. We did not receive any upfront payments or milestones during year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, the $144.6 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of available-for-sale investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the $88.7 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale investments.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, the $336.2 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a $327.5 million increase in net proceeds received from our April 2019 follow-on public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us, and a $6.9 million increase in proceeds received from stock option exercises.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the $539.5 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a total of $541.5 million decrease in net proceeds received from our April 2017 and December 2017 follow-on public offerings, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us, partially offset by proceeds received from stock option exercises.\nBorrowings\nIn May 2013, we entered into the loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. Under the terms of the loan and security agreement, we borrowed $5.0 million. Loan advances under the loan and security agreement accrue interest at a fixed rate of 2.0% above the prime rate. In November 2014, we amended the loan and security agreement and borrowed an additional $5.0 million. Each loan advance included an interest-only payment period. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid principal payments of $1.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively, on the $10.0 million of advances. We were required to pay a fee of 4% of the total loan advances at the end of the term of the loan. There were no financial covenants associated with the loan and security agreement. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no outstanding principal and interest under the loan and security agreement.\nSee Note 9, Term Loan,\u201d in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, initiate or continue clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for our drug candidates, including marketing approval for AYVAKIT for additional indications or in additional geographies. In addition, we expect to incur additional significant commercialization expenses for AYVAKIT and other drug candidates, if approved, related to drug sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of potential collaborators or licensors. We may also need to raise additional funds sooner if we choose to pursue additional indications or geographies for any of our approved drugs or drug candidates or otherwise expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate certain of our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $548.0 million. Based on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments including the $308.2 million in estimated net proceeds from our January 2020 follow-on public offering, together with anticipated product revenues but excluding any additional potential option fees, milestone payments or other payments under our collaboration or license agreements, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2022. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, pre-clinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our approved drugs and drug candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs of securing manufacturing, packaging and labeling arrangements for development activities and commercial production, including active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, drug substance and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>drug product material for use in pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, our compassionate use program and for use as commercial supply, as applicable; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of marketing applications for our drug candidates, including avapritinib for additional indications or in additional geographies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs of maintaining, expanding or contracting for sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in connection with commercialization of any of our approved drugs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the success of our collaborations with Roche and CStone and our license agreement with Clementia, as well as our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations, partnerships or licenses on favorable terms, if at all; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under our collaboration agreements with Roche and CStone or license agreement with Clementia, or any collaboration, partnership or license agreements that we may enter into in the future; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under future collaboration agreements, if any; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the extent to which we acquire or in-license other drugs, drug candidates or technologies and the terms of any such arrangements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the success of our current or future collaborations for the development of companion diagnostic tests; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the success of our commercialization efforts and market acceptance for AYVAKIT or any of our future approved drugs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs of continuing to expand our operations outside the U.S. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIdentifying potential drug candidates, conducting pre-clinical development and testing and clinical trials and, for any drug candidates that receive marketing approval, establishing and maintaining commercial infrastructure is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain additional marketing approvals, including for avapritinib in additional indications or geographies, and achieve substantial revenues for any of our drugs that receive marketing approval, including for AYVAKIT in the U.S. In addition, AYVAKIT and any other drug candidates that receive marketing approvals, including AYVAKIT for additional indications or in additional geographies, may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial drug revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs primarily through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds, other than our collaborations with Roche and CStone and the license agreement with Clementia, which are limited in scope and duration and subject to the achievement of milestones or royalties on sales of licensed products, if any. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that materially adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, would increase our fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our intellectual property, future revenue streams, research\nprograms, drugs or drug candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market drug and drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2019:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 137,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 25,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 70,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 137,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 25,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 70,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>Represents future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases, net of payments under our sublease for the office and laboratory space located at 38 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

We have not included these payments in the table of contractual obligations above since the contracts are generally cancelable at any time by us upon less than 180 days' prior written notice. Certain of these agreements require us to pay milestones to such third parties upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones, which may not be achieved.\nWe also have obligations to make future payments to third parties that become due and payable on the achievement of certain milestones, including future payments to third parties with whom we have entered into agreements to develop and commercialize companion diagnostic tests for certain of our drug candidates. We have not included these commitments on our balance sheet or in the table above because the achievement and timing of these milestones is not fixed and determinable.\nOff-Balance Sheet

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \u2018\u2018Risk Factors'' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results or timing of certain events could differ materially from the results or timing described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a precision therapy company focused on genomically defined cancers, rare diseases and cancer immunotherapy. Our approach is to leverage our novel target discovery engine to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases and to craft highly selective and potent therapies that may provide significant and durable clinical responses for patients without adequate treatment options. This integrated biology and chemistry approach enables us to identify, characterize and design drug candidates to inhibit novel kinase targets that have been difficult to selectively inhibit. We believe that our uniquely targeted, scalable approach empowers the rapid design and development of new treatments and increases the likelihood of success. We have one precision therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and are currently advancing multiple investigational medicines in clinical development, along with multiple research programs.\nAvapritinib and BLU-263 - Systemic Mastocytosis and other Mast Cell Disorders\nAvapritinib\nWe are developing avapritinib for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis, or SM, a rare disorder that causes an overproduction of mast cells and the accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs, which can lead to a wide range of debilitating symptoms and organ dysfunction and failure. Nearly all cases of SM are driven by the KIT D816V mutation, which aberrantly activates mast cells.\nWe are currently evaluating avapritinib in an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our EXPLORER trial, an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our PATHFINDER trial, and an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in indolent and smoldering SM, which we refer to as our PIONEER trial. We plan to present updated data from the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials in the second half of 2020. In December 2019, we reported initial data from the dose-finding portion (part 1) of the PIONEER trial at the 61st American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition, or ASH annual meeting. We plan to report updated data from part 1 of the PIONEER trial in a late-breaking oral presentation on March 14, 2020 at the annual meeting for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, or AAAAI annual meeting. Based on these data, we expect to initiate patient screening in part 2 of the PIONEER trial in the second quarter of 2020 and complete enrollment by the end of 2020.\nWe plan to submit a supplemental new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for avapritinib for the treatment of advanced SM in the second half of 2020, which we anticipate will be focused on data from patients in the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials who were treated with avapritinib at a starting dose of 200 mg once daily, or QD, supported by pooled data from all doses. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of mastocytosis, and the European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation to avapritinib for the treatment of mastocytosis. In addition, the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to avapritinib for the treatment of advanced SM, including the subtypes of aggressive SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm and mast cell leukemia.\nBLU-263\nWe are developing BLU-263 for the treatment of indolent SM and other mast cell disorders. BLU-263 is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective KIT inhibitor currently in the discovery stage. BLU-263 is\ndesigned to have equivalent potency as avapritinib, improved selectivity for KIT, with low off-target activity, and lower penetration of the central nervous system relative to avapritinib based on preclinical data, which we believe will enable development of BLU-263 in a broad population of patients with indolent SM, including patients with lower disease burden requiring potentially life-long chronic therapy, as well as patients with other KIT-driven mast cell disorders. We plan to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, for BLU-263 for indolent SM and initiate a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2020.\nPralsetinib - RET-altered Cancers\nWe are developing pralsetinib for the treatment of RET-altered non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, medullary thyroid carcinoma, or MTC, and other solid tumors. Pralsetinib is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase. Pralsetinib is designed to inhibit the activating RET fusions and mutations that drive cancer growth and remain active in the presence of resistance mutations that we predict will arise from treatment with first generation therapies. RET activating fusions and mutations drive disease in subsets of patients with NSCLC, and cancers of the thyroid, including MTC and papillary thyroid cancer, or PTC, and our research suggests that RET may drive disease in subsets of patients with colon cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and other cancers.\nWe are currently evaluating pralsetinib in an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with RET-altered NSCLC, MTC and other advanced solid tumors, which we refer to as our ARROW trial. In January 2020, we reported top-line data from the ARROW trial in RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients treated with pralsetinib at 400 mg QD. We plan to report top-line data from the ARROW trial in RET-mutant MTC patients in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we plan to present the registration data from the ARROW trial of pralsetinib in RET fusion-positive NSCLC and RET-mutant MTC in 2020. We recently announced the activation of the first trial site for our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating pralsetinib in patients with first-line RET fusion-positive NSCLC, which we refer to as our AcceleRET Lung trial, and we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of pralsetinib in first-line RET-mutant MTC in the second half of 2020.\nIn January 2020, we initiated the submission of a rolling NDA to the FDA for the treatment of patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC, and we expect to complete the submission in the first quarter of 2020. We plan to submit an NDA to the FDA for pralsetinib for the treatment of patients with MTC previously treated with an approved multi-kinase inhibitor in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we plan to submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for pralsetinib for RET fusion-positive NSCLC in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe FDA has granted orphan drug designation to pralsetinib for the treatment of RET-rearranged NSCLC, JAK1/2-positive NSCLC or TRKC-positive NSCLC, and the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to pralsetinib for the treatment of patients with RET-fusion positive NSCLC that has progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy and to pralsetinib for the treatment of patients with RET mutation-positive MTC that requires systemic treatment and for which there are no acceptable alternative treatments.\nAvapritinib - Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors\nWe are also developing avapritinib for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or GIST, a rare disease that is a sarcoma, or tumor of bone or connective tissue, of the gastrointestinal tract. Avapritinib is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets KIT and PDGFRA mutations. These mutations abnormally activate receptor tyrosine kinases that are drivers of GIST.\nIn January 2020, the FDA granted approval of avapritinib under the brand name AYVAKIT for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. The efficacy of AYVAKIT was established from 43 patients in the NAVIGATOR trial with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring PDGFRA exon 18 mutations, including 38 patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations. The safety of AYVAKIT in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST was evaluated in 204 patients who received 300 mg QD or 400 mg QD dosing in the NAVIGATOR trial.\nWe are also developing avapritinib for the treatment of third-line and later GIST (including fourth-line GIST). We are currently evaluating avapritinib for the treatment of GIST in an ongoing registration-enabling global, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial comparing avapritinib to regorafenib in third-line GIST, which we refer to as our VOYAGER trial. The FDA is currently reviewing our NDA for avapritinib for the treatment of fourth-line GIST, and this application has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, action date of May 14, 2020. As part of the review, the FDA has requested top-line data from our VOYAGER trial. We expect to provide the top-line data to the FDA early in the second quarter of 2020 to enable the FDA to take action by the PDUFA action date and we also expect to report the top-line data in the second quarter of 2020.\nBased on data from the VOYAGER trial, we plan to submit a supplemental NDA to the FDA for avapritinib for the treatment of third-line GIST in the second half of 2020. In addition, the EMA is currently reviewing our MAA for the treatment of adult patients with PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST, regardless of prior therapy, and we anticipate a decision from the European Commission in the third quarter of 2020. We plan to pursue an MAA for third-line and later GIST (including fourth-line GIST) based on data from our VOYAGER trial.\nThe FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to avapritinib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The FDA has also granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST and fast track designation to avapritinib for (i) the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST that progressed following treatment with imatinib and a second tyrosine kinase inhibitor and (ii) the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST with the PDGFRA D842V mutation regardless of prior therapy. In addition, the European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST.\nFisogatinib - Hepatocellular Carcinoma\nWe are developing fisogatinib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC. Fisogatinib is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets FGFR4, a kinase that is aberrantly activated in a defined subset of patients with HCC, the most common type of liver cancer. We are currently evaluating fisogatinib in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced HCC. As part of our collaboration with CStone Pharmaceuticals, or CStone, we are also evaluating fisogatinib in combination with CS1001, a clinical-stage anti-PDL1 immunotherapy being developed by CStone, for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic HCC in an ongoing Phase 1b/2 trial conducted in multiple clinical sites in China. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to fisogatinib for the treatment of HCC.\nDiscovery Platform\nWe plan to continue to leverage our discovery platform to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases in genomically defined patient populations and craft drug candidates that potently and selectively target these kinases. In January 2020, we announced the nomination of a development candidate for the treatment of EGFR Exon 19/L858R+T790M+C797S, which we refer to as resistant EGFR-positive triple mutant NSCLC. Following this nomination, we currently have five wholly-owned discovery programs, consisting of the following: BLU-263; the development candidate for the treatment of resistant EGFR-positive triple mutant NSCLC; a pre-development candidate program targeting EGFR Exon 19/L858R+C797S, which we refer to as resistant EGFR-positive double mutant NSCLC; and two pre-development candidate programs for undisclosed kinase targets. EGFR Exon 19/L858R+T790M+C797S and EGFR Exon 19/L858R+C797S are acquired resistance mutations in NSCLC patients following treatment with osimertinib. We plan to nominate up to two additional development candidates by the end of 2020.\nDevelopment and Commercialization Rights\nWe currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to avapritinib, pralsetinib and fisogatinib, other than the rights licensed to CStone for these drug candidates in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or the CStone territory. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our discovery programs, other than the discovery-stage cancer immunotherapy programs under collaboration with F.\nHoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., which we collectively refer to as Roche, and BLU-782, which is licensed to Clementia Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Clementia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ipsen S.A .\nCollaborations and Licenses\nRoche. We entered into a collaboration with Roche in March 2016. Under our collaboration agreement with Roche, we are working with Roche to discover, develop and commercialize up to four small molecule therapeutics targeting kinases believed to be important in cancer immunotherapy, as single products or possibly in combination with other therapeutics. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we and Roche announced one of the kinase targets under the collaboration, MAP4K1, which is believed to play a role in T cell regulation.\nCStone. We entered into a collaboration with CStone in June 2018. Under our collaboration agreement with CStone, we are seeking to develop and commercialize avapritinib, pralsetinib and fisogatinib, including back-up forms and certain other forms, in the CStone territory either as a monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy.\nClementia. In October 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Clementia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ipsen S.A., and granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to Clementia to develop and commercialize BLU-782, as well as specified other compounds related to the BLU-782 program. BLU-782 is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets mutant activin-like kinase 2, or ALK2, in development for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP. Clementia is planning to commence a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of BLU-782 for the treatment of FOP in 2020 as a monotherapy. The FDA has granted a rare pediatric disease designation, orphan drug designation and fast track designation to BLU-782, each for the treatment of FOP.\nWe will continue to evaluate additional collaborations, partnerships and licenses that could maximize the value for our programs and allow us to leverage the expertise of strategic collaborators, partners and licensors, including in additional geographies where we may not have current operations or expertise. We are also focused on engaging in collaborations, partnerships and license agreements to capitalize on our discovery platform outside of our primary strategic focus area of cancer and rare diseases.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, private placements of our convertible preferred stock, collaborations and a debt financing. Through December 31, 2019, we have received an aggregate of $1.5 billion from such transactions, including $1.2 billion in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in our May 2015 initial public offering, or IPO, and December 2016, April 2017, December 2017 and April 2019 follow-on public offerings, $115.1 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, $18.8 million in upfront and milestone payments under our former collaboration with Alexion Pharma Holding, or Alexion, $63.0 million in upfront and milestone payments under our collaboration with Roche, $50.0 million upfront and milestone payments under our collaboration with CStone, a $25.0 million upfront payment under our license agreement with Clementia and $10.0 million in gross proceeds from a debt financing. In addition, we received $308.2 million in estimated net proceeds from our January 2020 follow-on public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $347.6 million, $236.6 million and $148.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $945.2 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we:\n \u25cf continue to advance and initiate clinical development activities for avapritinib, pralsetinib, fisogatinib and BLU-263; \n \u25cf seek marketing approval for avapritinib in additional geographies and indications and marketing approvals for other drug candidates; \n \u25cf maintain and expand our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval; \n \u25cf continue to manufacture increasing quantities of drug substance and drug product material for use in pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and commercialization; \n \u25cf continue to discover, validate and develop additional drug candidates; \n \u25cf conduct research and development activities under our collaborations with Roche and CStone; \n \u25cf conduct development and commercialization activities for companion diagnostic tests for AYVAKIT and current or future drug candidates; \n \u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u25cf acquire or in-license other drug, drug candidates or technologies; \n \u25cf hire additional research, clinical, quality, manufacturing, regulatory, commercial and general and administrative personnel; and \n \u25cf incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. \nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nAs of December 31, 2019, our revenue consists of collaboration revenue under our collaborations with Roche and CStone, including amounts that are recognized related to upfront payments, milestone payments and amounts due to us for research and development services, and license revenue under our license agreement with Clementia.\nIn January 2020, the FDA granted approval of avapritinib under the brand name AYVAKIT for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations, and we have commenced the sale of AYVAKIT in the U.S. As a result, we will generate revenue from sales of AYVAKIT in 2020. In the future, we expect to generate revenue from a combination of sales of our approved drugs, royalties on drug sales and cost reimbursements, as well as upfront, milestone, royalty and other payments, if any, under any current or future collaborations and licenses, including revenues related to the supply of our drug candidates or approved drugs to CStone for development and commercialization activities in the CStone territory. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of product sales, license fees, research and development services and related reimbursements, payments for manufacturing services, and option fees, milestone payments or other payments under our collaboration or license agreements, if any.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research and development activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our drug candidates, which include:\n \u25cf employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u25cf expenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development, pre-clinical activities, clinical activities and manufacturing on our behalf; \n \u25cf expenses incurred under agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of companion diagnostic tests; \n \u25cf the cost of consultants; \n \u25cf the cost associated with regulatory quality assurance and quality control operations; \n \u25cf the cost of lab supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing pre-clinical study materials, clinical trial materials and commercial supply materials; and \n \u25cf facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other operating costs in support of research and development activities. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nThe successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. As such, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of these drug candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our drug candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n \u25cf establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies; \n \u25cf successful enrollment in, and completion of clinical trials; \n \u25cf receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u25cf establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; \n \u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for AYVAKIT and our drug candidates; \n \u25cf commercializing AYVAKIT and our drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \n \u25cf market acceptance of AYVAKIT and any future drug we may commercialize; and \n \u25cf continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our drug candidate development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. In addition, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.\nA significant portion of our research and development expenses have been external expenses, which we track on a program-by-program basis following nomination as a development candidate. Our internal research and development expenses are primarily personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense. Except\nfor internal research and development expenses related to collaboration agreements, we do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they are deployed across multiple projects under development.\nThe following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Other development and pre-development candidate expenses, unallocated expenses and internal research and development expenses have been classified separately.\n We expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we expand our operations and incur additional costs in connection with our clinical trials and preparing regulatory filings. These increases will likely include the costs related to the implementation and expansion of clinical trial sites and related patient enrollment, monitoring, program management and manufacturing expenses for API, drug product and drug substance for current and future clinical trials and commercial inventory. In addition, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we incur additional costs in connection with research and development activities under our collaboration with Roche, development activities under our collaboration with CStone and development activities for companion diagnostic tests for current and future drug candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, commercial, business development, information technology, legal and human resources functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, pre-commercial development activities, legal fees related to intellectual property and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future to support additional research and development activities and commercialization activities, including expanding our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any drugs for which we may obtain marketing approval in additional indications or geographies and expanding our operations in the U.S. and outside the U.S. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, legal, auditing and filing fees and general compliance and consulting expenses, among other expenses. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company and expanding the scope of our operations.\nInterest Income (Expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of income earned on cash equivalents and investments.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies are those policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements. Management has determined that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses, available-for-sale investments, stock-based compensation and leases.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we refer to as ASC 606, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. We only applied the modified retrospective transition method to contracts that were not completed as January 1, 2018, the effective date of adoption for ASC 606. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe enter into licensing agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which we may exclusively license rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our drug and drug candidates to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; reimbursement of certain costs; customer option exercise fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.\nIn determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under our agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: (a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above; (b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and (c) the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties and sales-based milestones, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance\nobligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.\nExclusive Licenses. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a promise or performance obligation is distinct from the other promises, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a promise for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise, whether the value of the promise is dependent on the unsatisfied promise, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nResearch and Development Services. The promises under our collaboration agreements may include research and development services to be performed by our employees on behalf of the partner. Payments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts are recognized as the services are performed and presented on a gross basis because we are the principal for such efforts. Reimbursements from and payments to the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.\nCustomer Options. If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options that are not determined to be material rights are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised.\nMilestone Payments. At the inception of each arrangement that includes research or development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we reevaluate the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nRoyalties. For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments upon first commercial sales and milestone payments based on a level of sales, which are the result of a customer-vendor\nrelationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\nCollaborative Arrangements. We analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities and therefore within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, which we refer to as ASC 808. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and which elements of the collaboration are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. Amounts that are owed to collaboration partners are recognized as an offset to collaboration revenues as such amounts are incurred by the collaboration partner. Where amounts owed to a collaboration partner exceed our collaboration revenues in each quarterly period, such amounts are classified as research and development expense. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above under ASC 606.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nAvailable-for-Sale Investments\nWe classify marketable securities with a remaining maturity when purchased of greater than three months as available-for-sale. Marketable securities with a remaining maturity date greater than one year are classified as non-current. Available-for-sale securities are maintained by an investment manager and may consist of U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. government agency securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity until\nrealized. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income and/or expense over the life of the instrument. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense). If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in value of the investment, we consider all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other-than-temporary\u201d and, if so, mark the investment to market through a charge to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation -Stock Compensation, which we refer to as ASC 718. We expense the fair value of stock-based awards granted to employees and members of the board of directors over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period. Compensation cost for stock-based awards issued to employees is measured using the estimated fair value at the grant date and is adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures. We estimate the fair value of options granted to employees at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that requires management to apply judgment and make estimates, including:\n \u25cf expected volatility, which is calculated based on reported volatility data for a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. For these analyses, we select companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We intend to consistently apply this process using representative companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available; \n \u25cf risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption; \n \u25cf expected term, which we calculate using the simplified method, as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, as we have insufficient historical information regarding our stock options to provide a basis for an estimate. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the contractual term of ten years and the weighted-average vesting term of the stock options, taking into consideration multiple vesting tranches; \n \u25cf dividend yield, which is zero based on the fact that we never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. \nStock-based awards issued to non-employees, including directors for non-board-related services, are accounted for based on the fair value of such services received or of the intrinsic value of equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured. The measurement date for non-employee awards is the date of grant. Stock-based awards subject to service-based vesting conditions are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\nThe purchase price of common stock under our 2015 employee stock purchase plan, as amended, or 2015 ESPP, is equal to 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value per share of the common stock on the first business day of an offering period and (ii) the fair market value per share of the common stock on the purchase date. The fair value of the discounted purchases made under our 2015 ESPP is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of the look-back provision plus the 15% discount is recognized as compensation expense over the 180-day purchase period.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 84), which we refer to as ASC 842, which requires the recognition of the right-of-use assets and related operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet.\nWe adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at January 1, 2019. The adoption of ASC 842 had a substantial impact on our consolidated balance sheet and no impact to our consolidated statements of operations. Upon adoption of ASC 842, we recognized an adjustment of $54.2 million and $74.1 million to operating lease right-of-use assets and the related lease liabilities, respectively. The operating lease liabilities are based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments discounted using our secured incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of January 1, 2019.\nFor contracts entered into on or after the effective date, at the inception of a contract, we assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether we have the right to direct the use of the asset. At inception of a lease, we allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments.\nLeases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria are met: the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset or the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any of these criteria.\nFor all leases at the lease commencement date, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability are recognized. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred if any, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our secured incremental borrowing rate for the same term as the underlying lease.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: the fixed noncancelable lease payments, payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal period will be exercised, and payments for early termination options unless it is reasonably certain the lease will not be terminated early.\nLease cost for operating leases consists of the lease payments plus any initial direct costs, primarily brokerage commissions, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Included in lease cost are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that are not included in the initial lease liability and lease payments incurred in the period for any leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Lease cost for finance leases consists of the amortization of the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense determined on an amortized cost basis. The lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense.\nWe made an accounting policy election to not recognize leases with an initial term of 12 months or less within our consolidated balance sheets and to recognize those lease payments on a straight-line basis in our consolidated statements of income over the lease term.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:\n Collaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue increased by $22.0 million from $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to the CStone, Roche and Clementia agreements. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to the CStone and Roche agreements. We recorded $12.1 million and $40.0 million revenue under the CStone agreement for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Collaboration revenue related to the CStone agreement for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $12.0 million in milestone revenue related to several development and regulatory milestones that were achieved during the year and $0.1 million related to drug supply for territory specific trials. Collaboration revenue related to the CStone agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of a $40.0 million upfront payment was recognized upon the execution of the CStone collaboration agreement. We recorded $8.2 million and $4.5 million revenue under the Roche agreement for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily related to amortization of the total upfront and milestone payments received as of such periods. We recorded $46.2 million revenue under the Clementia license agreement for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of a $25.0 million upfront payment received, a $20.0 million cash milestone payment due in the third quarter of 2020 and a $1.2 million inventory transfer.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $87.8 million from $243.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $331.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to the following:\n \u25cf approximately $35.3 million in increased expenses for external clinical activities related to avapritinib, pralsetinib and BLU-782; \n \u25cf approximately $31.3 million in increased personnel expense, primarily due to an increase in headcount, which was driven by growth in the clinical and manufacturing organizations and an increase of $11.6 million in stock-based compensation expense; \n \u25cf approximately $15.1 million in increased expenses associated with clinical and commercial manufacturing activities; and \n \u25cf approximately $6.1 million in increased expenses associated with continuing to build our discovery platform and advance our discovery pipeline. \nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $48.5 million from $47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $96.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily related to increased costs and personnel expenses, including an increase of $12.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, associated with building our commercial infrastructure and to support the overall growth of our business.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net increased by $3.2 million from $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to higher average investment balances and a higher rate of return on investments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, decreased by less than $0.1 million from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:\n Collaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue increased by $23.1 million from $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to the CStone and Roche agreements. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was related to the Roche and Alexion agreements. We entered into the CStone agreement on June 1, 2018 and recorded collaboration revenue of $40.0 million under the CStone agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018. We recorded $4.5 million and $5.2 million in collaboration revenue under the Roche agreement for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 and the resulting change in the revenue recognition pattern. We recorded collaboration revenue of\n$16.2 million under the Alexion agreement for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result of the termination of the Alexion agreement during 2017, we did not recognize any revenue under the Alexion agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $98.9 million from $144.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $243.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to the following:\n \u25cf approximately $35.3 million in increased expenses for external clinical activities related to avapritinib and pralsetinib; \n \u25cf approximately $27.5 million in increased personnel expense, primarily due to an increase in headcount, which was driven by growth in the clinical and manufacturing organizations as we advance our drug candidates and an increase of $10.7 million in stock-based compensation expense; \n \u25cf approximately $27.3 million in increased expenses associated with clinical and commercial manufacturing activities; \n \u25cf approximately $5.6 million in increased expenses associated with continuing to build our discovery platform and advance our discovery pipeline; and \n \u25cf approximately $2.8 million in increased toxicology studies, including expenses associated with pre-clinical studies, including IND-enabling studies, related to BLU-782. \nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $19.9 million from $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily related to the following:\n \u25cf approximately $11.1 million in increased personnel expenses, primarily due to an increase in general and administrative headcount to support our overall growth and including an increase of $7.3 million in stock-based compensation expense; \n \u25cf approximately $6.1 million in increased professional fees, including pre-commercial planning activities; and \n \u25cf approximately $2.1 million in increased facility costs related to our new headquarters in 2018. \nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net increased by $7.4 million from $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to higher average investment balances and a higher rate of return on investments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, increased by $0.1 million from $0.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $0.2 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, private placements of our convertible preferred stock, collaborations, a license agreement and a debt financing.\nThrough December 31, 2019, we have received an aggregate of $1.5 billion from such transactions, including $1.2 billion in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in our May 2015 IPO and December 2016, April 2017, December 2017 and April 2019 follow-on public offerings, $115.1 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, $18.8 million in upfront and milestone payments from Alexion, $63.0 million in upfront and milestone payments from Roche, $50.0 million in upfront and milestone payments from CStone, a $25.0 million in upfront payment from Clementia and $10.0 million in gross proceeds from a debt financing.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $548.0 million. In addition, we received $308.2 million in estimated net proceeds from our January 2020 follow-on public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \u2018\u2018Risk Factors'' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results or timing of certain events could differ materially from the results or timing described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a precision therapy company focused on genomically defined cancers, rare diseases and cancer immunotherapy. Our approach is to leverage our novel target discovery engine to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases and to craft highly selective and potent therapies that may provide significant and durable clinical responses for patients without adequate treatment options. This integrated biology and chemistry approach enables us to identify, characterize and design drug candidates to inhibit novel kinase targets that have been difficult to selectively inhibit. We believe that our uniquely targeted, scalable approach empowers the rapid design and development of new treatments and increases the likelihood of success. We have one precision therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and are currently advancing multiple investigational medicines in clinical development, along with multiple research programs.\nAvapritinib and BLU-263 - Systemic Mastocytosis and other Mast Cell Disorders\nAvapritinib\nWe are developing avapritinib for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis, or SM, a rare disorder that causes an overproduction of mast cells and the accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs, which can lead to a wide range of debilitating symptoms and organ dysfunction and failure. Nearly all cases of SM are driven by the KIT D816V mutation, which aberrantly activates mast cells.\nWe are currently evaluating avapritinib in an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our EXPLORER trial, an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our PATHFINDER trial, and an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in indolent and smoldering SM, which we refer to as our PIONEER trial. We plan to present updated data from the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials in the second half of 2020. In December 2019, we reported initial data from the dose-finding portion (part 1) of the PIONEER trial at the 61st American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition, or ASH annual meeting. We plan to report updated data from part 1 of the PIONEER trial in a late-breaking oral presentation on March 14, 2020 at the annual meeting for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, or AAAAI annual meeting. Based on these data, we expect to initiate patient screening in part 2 of the PIONEER trial in the second quarter of 2020 and complete enrollment by the end of 2020.\nWe plan to submit a supplemental new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for avapritinib for the treatment of advanced SM in the second half of 2020, which we anticipate will be focused on data from patients in the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials who were treated with avapritinib at a starting dose of 200 mg once daily, or QD, supported by pooled data from all doses. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of mastocytosis, and the European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation to avapritinib for the treatment of mastocytosis. In addition, the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to avapritinib for the treatment of advanced SM, including the subtypes of aggressive SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm and mast cell leukemia.\nBLU-263\nWe are developing BLU-263 for the treatment of indolent SM and other mast cell disorders. BLU-263 is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective KIT inhibitor currently in the discovery stage. BLU-263 is\ndesigned to have equivalent potency as avapritinib, improved selectivity for KIT, with low off-target activity, and lower penetration of the central nervous system relative to avapritinib based on preclinical data, which we believe will enable development of BLU-263 in a broad population of patients with indolent SM, including patients with lower disease burden requiring potentially life-long chronic therapy, as well as patients with other KIT-driven mast cell disorders. We plan to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, for BLU-263 for indolent SM and initiate a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2020.\nPralsetinib - RET-altered Cancers\nWe are developing pralsetinib for the treatment of RET-altered non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, medullary thyroid carcinoma, or MTC, and other solid tumors. Pralsetinib is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase. Pralsetinib is designed to inhibit the activating RET fusions and mutations that drive cancer growth and remain active in the presence of resistance mutations that we predict will arise from treatment with first generation therapies. RET activating fusions and mutations drive disease in subsets of patients with NSCLC, and cancers of the thyroid, including MTC and papillary thyroid cancer, or PTC, and our research suggests that RET may drive disease in subsets of patients with colon cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and other cancers.\nWe are currently evaluating pralsetinib in an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with RET-altered NSCLC, MTC and other advanced solid tumors, which we refer to as our ARROW trial. In January 2020, we reported top-line data from the ARROW trial in RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients treated with pralsetinib at 400 mg QD. We plan to report top-line data from the ARROW trial in RET-mutant MTC patients in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we plan to present the registration data from the ARROW trial of pralsetinib in RET fusion-positive NSCLC and RET-mutant MTC in 2020. We recently announced the activation of the first trial site for our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating pralsetinib in patients with first-line RET fusion-positive NSCLC, which we refer to as our AcceleRET Lung trial, and we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of pralsetinib in first-line RET-mutant MTC in the second half of 2020.\nIn January 2020, we initiated the submission of a rolling NDA to the FDA for the treatment of patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC, and we expect to complete the submission in the first quarter of 2020. We plan to submit an NDA to the FDA for pralsetinib for the treatment of patients with MTC previously treated with an approved multi-kinase inhibitor in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we plan to submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for pralsetinib for RET fusion-positive NSCLC in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe FDA has granted orphan drug designation to pralsetinib for the treatment of RET-rearranged NSCLC, JAK1/2-positive NSCLC or TRKC-positive NSCLC, and the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to pralsetinib for the treatment of patients with RET-fusion positive NSCLC that has progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy and to pralsetinib for the treatment of patients with RET mutation-positive MTC that requires systemic treatment and for which there are no acceptable alternative treatments.\nAvapritinib - Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors\nWe are also developing avapritinib for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or GIST, a rare disease that is a sarcoma, or tumor of bone or connective tissue, of the gastrointestinal tract. Avapritinib is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets KIT and PDGFRA mutations. These mutations abnormally activate receptor tyrosine kinases that are drivers of GIST.\nIn January 2020, the FDA granted approval of avapritinib under the brand name AYVAKIT for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. The efficacy of AYVAKIT was established from 43 patients in the NAVIGATOR trial with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring PDGFRA exon 18 mutations, including 38 patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations. The safety of AYVAKIT in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST was evaluated in 204 patients who received 300 mg QD or 400 mg QD dosing in the NAVIGATOR trial.\nWe are also developing avapritinib for the treatment of third-line and later GIST (including fourth-line GIST). We are currently evaluating avapritinib for the treatment of GIST in an ongoing registration-enabling global, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial comparing avapritinib to regorafenib in third-line GIST, which we refer to as our VOYAGER trial. The FDA is currently reviewing our NDA for avapritinib for the treatment of fourth-line GIST, and this application has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, action date of May 14, 2020. As part of the review, the FDA has requested top-line data from our VOYAGER trial. We expect to provide the top-line data to the FDA early in the second quarter of 2020 to enable the FDA to take action by the PDUFA action date and we also expect to report the top-line data in the second quarter of 2020.\nBased on data from the VOYAGER trial, we plan to submit a supplemental NDA to the FDA for avapritinib for the treatment of third-line GIST in the second half of 2020. In addition, the EMA is currently reviewing our MAA for the treatment of adult patients with PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST, regardless of prior therapy, and we anticipate a decision from the European Commission in the third quarter of 2020. We plan to pursue an MAA for third-line and later GIST (including fourth-line GIST) based on data from our VOYAGER trial.\nThe FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to avapritinib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The FDA has also granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST and fast track designation to avapritinib for (i) the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST that progressed following treatment with imatinib and a second tyrosine kinase inhibitor and (ii) the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST with the PDGFRA D842V mutation regardless of prior therapy. In addition, the European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST.\nFisogatinib - Hepatocellular Carcinoma\nWe are developing fisogatinib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC. Fisogatinib is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets FGFR4, a kinase that is aberrantly activated in a defined subset of patients with HCC, the most common type of liver cancer. We are currently evaluating fisogatinib in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced HCC. As part of our collaboration with CStone Pharmaceuticals, or CStone, we are also evaluating fisogatinib in combination with CS1001, a clinical-stage anti-PDL1 immunotherapy being developed by CStone, for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic HCC in an ongoing Phase 1b/2 trial conducted in multiple clinical sites in China. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to fisogatinib for the treatment of HCC.\nDiscovery Platform\nWe plan to continue to leverage our discovery platform to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases in genomically defined patient populations and craft drug candidates that potently and selectively target these kinases. In January 2020, we announced the nomination of a development candidate for the treatment of EGFR Exon 19/L858R+T790M+C797S, which we refer to as resistant EGFR-positive triple mutant NSCLC. Following this nomination, we currently have five wholly-owned discovery programs, consisting of the following: BLU-263; the development candidate for the treatment of resistant EGFR-positive triple mutant NSCLC; a pre-development candidate program targeting EGFR Exon 19/L858R+C797S, which we refer to as resistant EGFR-positive double mutant NSCLC; and two pre-development candidate programs for undisclosed kinase targets. EGFR Exon 19/L858R+T790M+C797S and EGFR Exon 19/L858R+C797S are acquired resistance mutations in NSCLC patients following treatment with osimertinib. We plan to nominate up to two additional development candidates by the end of 2020.\nDevelopment and Commercialization Rights\nWe currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to avapritinib, pralsetinib and fisogatinib, other than the rights licensed to CStone for these drug candidates in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or the CStone territory. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our discovery programs, other than the discovery-stage cancer immunotherapy programs under collaboration with F.\nHoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., which we collectively refer to as Roche, and BLU-782, which is licensed to Clementia Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Clementia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ipsen S.A .\nCollaborations and Licenses\nRoche. We entered into a collaboration with Roche in March 2016. Under our collaboration agreement with Roche, we are working with Roche to discover, develop and commercialize up to four small molecule therapeutics targeting kinases believed to be important in cancer immunotherapy, as single products or possibly in combination with other therapeutics. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we and Roche announced one of the kinase targets under the collaboration, MAP4K1, which is believed to play a role in T cell regulation.\nCStone. We entered into a collaboration with CStone in June 2018. Under our collaboration agreement with CStone, we are seeking to develop and commercialize avapritinib, pralsetinib and fisogatinib, including back-up forms and certain other forms, in the CStone territory either as a monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy.\nClementia. In October 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Clementia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ipsen S.A., and granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to Clementia to develop and commercialize BLU-782, as well as specified other compounds related to the BLU-782 program. BLU-782 is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets mutant activin-like kinase 2, or ALK2, in development for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP. Clementia is planning to commence a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of BLU-782 for the treatment of FOP in 2020 as a monotherapy. The FDA has granted a rare pediatric disease designation, orphan drug designation and fast track designation to BLU-782, each for the treatment of FOP.\nWe will continue to evaluate additional collaborations, partnerships and licenses that could maximize the value for our programs and allow us to leverage the expertise of strategic collaborators, partners and licensors, including in additional geographies where we may not have current operations or expertise. We are also focused on engaging in collaborations, partnerships and license agreements to capitalize on our discovery platform outside of our primary strategic focus area of cancer and rare diseases.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, private placements of our convertible preferred stock, collaborations and a debt financing. Through December 31, 2019, we have received an aggregate of $1.5 billion from such transactions, including $1.2 billion in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in our May 2015 initial public offering, or IPO, and December 2016, April 2017, December 2017 and April 2019 follow-on public offerings, $115.1 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, $18.8 million in upfront and milestone payments under our former collaboration with Alexion Pharma Holding, or Alexion, $63.0 million in upfront and milestone payments under our collaboration with Roche, $50.0 million upfront and milestone payments under our collaboration with CStone, a $25.0 million upfront payment under our license agreement with Clementia and $10.0 million in gross proceeds from a debt financing. In addition, we received $308.2 million in estimated net proceeds from our January 2020 follow-on public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $347.6 million, $236.6 million and $148.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $945.2 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we:\n \u25cf continue to advance and initiate clinical development activities for avapritinib, pralsetinib, fisogatinib and BLU-263; \n \u25cf seek marketing approval for avapritinib in additional geographies and indications and marketing approvals for other drug candidates; \n \u25cf maintain and expand our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval; \n \u25cf continue to manufacture increasing quantities of drug substance and drug product material for use in pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and commercialization; \n \u25cf continue to discover, validate and develop additional drug candidates; \n \u25cf conduct research and development activities under our collaborations with Roche and CStone; \n \u25cf conduct development and commercialization activities for companion diagnostic tests for AYVAKIT and current or future drug candidates; \n \u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u25cf acquire or in-license other drug, drug candidates or technologies; \n \u25cf hire additional research, clinical, quality, manufacturing, regulatory, commercial and general and administrative personnel; and \n \u25cf incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. \nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nAs of December 31, 2019, our revenue consists of collaboration revenue under our collaborations with Roche and CStone, including amounts that are recognized related to upfront payments, milestone payments and amounts due to us for research and development services, and license revenue under our license agreement with Clementia.\nIn January 2020, the FDA granted approval of avapritinib under the brand name AYVAKIT for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations, and we have commenced the sale of AYVAKIT in the U.S. As a result, we will generate revenue from sales of AYVAKIT in 2020. In the future, we expect to generate revenue from a combination of sales of our approved drugs, royalties on drug sales and cost reimbursements, as well as upfront, milestone, royalty and other payments, if any, under any current or future collaborations and licenses, including revenues related to the supply of our drug candidates or approved drugs to CStone for development and commercialization activities in the CStone territory. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of product sales, license fees, research and development services and related reimbursements, payments for manufacturing services, and option fees, milestone payments or other payments under our collaboration or license agreements, if any.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research and development activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our drug candidates, which include:\n \u25cf employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u25cf expenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development, pre-clinical activities, clinical activities and manufacturing on our behalf; \n \u25cf expenses incurred under agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of companion diagnostic tests; \n \u25cf the cost of consultants; \n \u25cf the cost associated with regulatory quality assurance and quality control operations; \n \u25cf the cost of lab supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing pre-clinical study materials, clinical trial materials and commercial supply materials; and \n \u25cf facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other operating costs in support of research and development activities. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nThe successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. As such, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of these drug candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our drug candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n \u25cf establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies; \n \u25cf successful enrollment in, and completion of clinical trials; \n \u25cf receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u25cf establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; \n \u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for AYVAKIT and our drug candidates; \n \u25cf commercializing AYVAKIT and our drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \n \u25cf market acceptance of AYVAKIT and any future drug we may commercialize; and \n \u25cf continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our drug candidate development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. In addition, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.\nA significant portion of our research and development expenses have been external expenses, which we track on a program-by-program basis following nomination as a development candidate. Our internal research and development expenses are primarily personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense. Except\nfor internal research and development expenses related to collaboration agreements, we do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they are deployed across multiple projects under development.\nThe following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Other development and pre-development candidate expenses, unallocated expenses and internal research and development expenses have been classified separately.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Avapritinib external expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 98,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 83,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 46,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pralsetinib external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fisogatinib external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BLU-263 external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other development and pre-development candidate expenses and unallocated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 331,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 243,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 144,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we expand our operations and incur additional costs in connection with our clinical trials and preparing regulatory filings. These increases will likely include the costs related to the implementation and expansion of clinical trial sites and related patient enrollment, monitoring, program management and manufacturing expenses for API, drug product and drug substance for current and future clinical trials and commercial inventory. In addition, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we incur additional costs in connection with research and development activities under our collaboration with Roche, development activities under our collaboration with CStone and development activities for companion diagnostic tests for current and future drug candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, commercial, business development, information technology, legal and human resources functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, pre-commercial development activities, legal fees related to intellectual property and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future to support additional research and development activities and commercialization activities, including expanding our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any drugs for which we may obtain marketing approval in additional indications or geographies and expanding our operations in the U.S. and outside the U.S. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, legal, auditing and filing fees and general compliance and consulting expenses, among other expenses. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company and expanding the scope of our operations.\nInterest Income (Expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of income earned on cash equivalents and investments.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies are those policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements. Management has determined that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses, available-for-sale investments, stock-based compensation and leases.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we refer to as ASC 606, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. We only applied the modified retrospective transition method to contracts that were not completed as January 1, 2018, the effective date of adoption for ASC 606. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe enter into licensing agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which we may exclusively license rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our drug and drug candidates to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; reimbursement of certain costs; customer option exercise fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.\nIn determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under our agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: (a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above; (b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and (c) the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties and sales-based milestones, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance\nobligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.\nExclusive Licenses. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a promise or performance obligation is distinct from the other promises, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a promise for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise, whether the value of the promise is dependent on the unsatisfied promise, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nResearch and Development Services. The promises under our collaboration agreements may include research and development services to be performed by our employees on behalf of the partner. Payments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts are recognized as the services are performed and presented on a gross basis because we are the principal for such efforts. Reimbursements from and payments to the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.\nCustomer Options. If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options that are not determined to be material rights are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised.\nMilestone Payments. At the inception of each arrangement that includes research or development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we reevaluate the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nRoyalties. For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments upon first commercial sales and milestone payments based on a level of sales, which are the result of a customer-vendor\nrelationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\nCollaborative Arrangements. We analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities and therefore within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, which we refer to as ASC 808. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and which elements of the collaboration are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. Amounts that are owed to collaboration partners are recognized as an offset to collaboration revenues as such amounts are incurred by the collaboration partner. Where amounts owed to a collaboration partner exceed our collaboration revenues in each quarterly period, such amounts are classified as research and development expense. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above under ASC 606.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nAvailable-for-Sale Investments\nWe classify marketable securities with a remaining maturity when purchased of greater than three months as available-for-sale. Marketable securities with a remaining maturity date greater than one year are classified as non-current. Available-for-sale securities are maintained by an investment manager and may consist of U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. government agency securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity until\nrealized. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income and/or expense over the life of the instrument. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense). If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in value of the investment, we consider all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other-than-temporary\u201d and, if so, mark the investment to market through a charge to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation -Stock Compensation, which we refer to as ASC 718. We expense the fair value of stock-based awards granted to employees and members of the board of directors over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period. Compensation cost for stock-based awards issued to employees is measured using the estimated fair value at the grant date and is adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures. We estimate the fair value of options granted to employees at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that requires management to apply judgment and make estimates, including:\n \u25cf expected volatility, which is calculated based on reported volatility data for a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. For these analyses, we select companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We intend to consistently apply this process using representative companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available; \n \u25cf risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption; \n \u25cf expected term, which we calculate using the simplified method, as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, as we have insufficient historical information regarding our stock options to provide a basis for an estimate. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the contractual term of ten years and the weighted-average vesting term of the stock options, taking into consideration multiple vesting tranches; \n \u25cf dividend yield, which is zero based on the fact that we never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. \nStock-based awards issued to non-employees, including directors for non-board-related services, are accounted for based on the fair value of such services received or of the intrinsic value of equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured. The measurement date for non-employee awards is the date of grant. Stock-based awards subject to service-based vesting conditions are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\nThe purchase price of common stock under our 2015 employee stock purchase plan, as amended, or 2015 ESPP, is equal to 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value per share of the common stock on the first business day of an offering period and (ii) the fair market value per share of the common stock on the purchase date. The fair value of the discounted purchases made under our 2015 ESPP is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of the look-back provision plus the 15% discount is recognized as compensation expense over the 180-day purchase period.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 84), which we refer to as ASC 842, which requires the recognition of the right-of-use assets and related operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet.\nWe adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at January 1, 2019. The adoption of ASC 842 had a substantial impact on our consolidated balance sheet and no impact to our consolidated statements of operations. Upon adoption of ASC 842, we recognized an adjustment of $54.2 million and $74.1 million to operating lease right-of-use assets and the related lease liabilities, respectively. The operating lease liabilities are based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments discounted using our secured incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of January 1, 2019.\nFor contracts entered into on or after the effective date, at the inception of a contract, we assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether we have the right to direct the use of the asset. At inception of a lease, we allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments.\nLeases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria are met: the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset or the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any of these criteria.\nFor all leases at the lease commencement date, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability are recognized. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred if any, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our secured incremental borrowing rate for the same term as the underlying lease.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: the fixed noncancelable lease payments, payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal period will be exercised, and payments for early termination options unless it is reasonably certain the lease will not be terminated early.\nLease cost for operating leases consists of the lease payments plus any initial direct costs, primarily brokerage commissions, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Included in lease cost are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that are not included in the initial lease liability and lease payments incurred in the period for any leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Lease cost for finance leases consists of the amortization of the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense determined on an amortized cost basis. The lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense.\nWe made an accounting policy election to not recognize leases with an initial term of 12 months or less within our consolidated balance sheets and to recognize those lease payments on a straight-line basis in our consolidated statements of income over the lease term.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 66,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 44,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 21,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 331,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 243,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 427,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 291,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 136,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (180)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (347,694)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (236,642)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 111,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Collaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue increased by $22.0 million from $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to the CStone, Roche and Clementia agreements. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to the CStone and Roche agreements. We recorded $12.1 million and $40.0 million revenue under the CStone agreement for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Collaboration revenue related to the CStone agreement for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $12.0 million in milestone revenue related to several development and regulatory milestones that were achieved during the year and $0.1 million related to drug supply for territory specific trials. Collaboration revenue related to the CStone agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of a $40.0 million upfront payment was recognized upon the execution of the CStone collaboration agreement. We recorded $8.2 million and $4.5 million revenue under the Roche agreement for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily related to amortization of the total upfront and milestone payments received as of such periods. We recorded $46.2 million revenue under the Clementia license agreement for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of a $25.0 million upfront payment received, a $20.0 million cash milestone payment due in the third quarter of 2020 and a $1.2 million inventory transfer.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $87.8 million from $243.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $331.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to the following:\n \u25cf approximately $35.3 million in increased expenses for external clinical activities related to avapritinib, pralsetinib and BLU-782; \n \u25cf approximately $31.3 million in increased personnel expense, primarily due to an increase in headcount, which was driven by growth in the clinical and manufacturing organizations and an increase of $11.6 million in stock-based compensation expense; \n \u25cf approximately $15.1 million in increased expenses associated with clinical and commercial manufacturing activities; and \n \u25cf approximately $6.1 million in increased expenses associated with continuing to build our discovery platform and advance our discovery pipeline. \nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $48.5 million from $47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $96.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to the CStone and Roche agreements. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was related to the Roche and Alexion agreements. We entered into the CStone agreement on June 1, 2018 and recorded collaboration revenue of $40.0 million under the CStone agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018. We recorded $4.5 million and $5.2 million in collaboration revenue under the Roche agreement for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 and the resulting change in the revenue recognition pattern. We recorded collaboration revenue of\n$16.2 million under the Alexion agreement for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result of the termination of the Alexion agreement during 2017, we did not recognize any revenue under the Alexion agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $98.9 million from $144.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $243.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to the following:\n \u25cf approximately $35.3 million in increased expenses for external clinical activities related to avapritinib and pralsetinib; \n \u25cf approximately $27.5 million in increased personnel expense, primarily due to an increase in headcount, which was driven by growth in the clinical and manufacturing organizations as we advance our drug candidates and an increase of $10.7 million in stock-based compensation expense; \n \u25cf approximately $27.3 million in increased expenses associated with clinical and commercial manufacturing activities; \n \u25cf approximately $5.6 million in increased expenses associated with continuing to build our discovery platform and advance our discovery pipeline; and \n \u25cf approximately $2.8 million in increased toxicology studies, including expenses associated with pre-clinical studies, including IND-enabling studies, related to BLU-782. \nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $19.9 million from $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
