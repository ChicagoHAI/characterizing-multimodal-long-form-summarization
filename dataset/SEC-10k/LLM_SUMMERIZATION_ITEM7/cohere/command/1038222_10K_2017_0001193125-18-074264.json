Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nManagement Summary\nOver the course of the year, the Company recorded incremental quarterly improvements in key financial metrics. Reis started the year with a first quarter decline in revenue and ended with positive revenue growth for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. Revenue declined in the first quarter of 2017 by (5.4)%; improved in the second quarter of 2017 by 0.8%; accelerated by 4.8% in the third quarter of 2017; and grew by 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to each respective 2016 quarter. These improving trends also occurred over the course of 2017 in income before taxes, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Reis Services EBITDA. These advances resulted from improving renewal rates (the overall renewal rate improved to 88.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017) and revenue from new business. All of these metrics will be discussed in greater detail in this section.\nDuring 2017, the Company also made significant product and data enhancements. Reis's database and analytical tools have historically covered the nine key property types most important to real estate professionals focused on the U.S. CRE market (apartment, office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage, seniors housing, student housing and affordable housing), providing up to 38 years of trend analysis and market forecasts for up to 275 metropolitan markets and thousands of submarkets. With the completion of a multi-year initiative to expand upon this cornerstone asset, Reis now offers market information, transaction data and building insights for all commercial properties throughout the nation, regardless of location, size, or use type. The achievement of \u201cEvery Property, Everywhere\u201d positions Reis to serve all CRE professionals and use-cases both within and beyond the Company's traditional property types and coverage boundaries. In parallel with the development of \u201cEvery Property, Everywhere,\u201d the Company has also built a new API, a delivery system that embeds Reis's data (legacy and newly launched) into any client's and prospect's internal system, regardless of platform.\nThe completion of this expansion of coverage in February 2018 affords Reis the opportunity to sell to new user groups within current client firms, and to accelerate sales among tens of thousands of prospect firms, including from investment sales brokerages, tax assessors, tax appeal professionals, and other commercial real estate professionals involved in transactions, asset and portfolio management. This achievement was only possible through the measured step up in investments in our database in recent years.\nCritical Business Metrics\nManagement considers certain metrics in evaluating its consolidated results and the performance of the Reis Services segment. These metrics are revenue, revenue growth, EBITDA (which is earnings (net income (loss)) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), EBITDA growth, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA (which is net income (loss) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation), Adjusted EBITDA growth and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Other important metrics that management considers include cash flow generation as well as the visibility into future performance as supported by our deferred revenue and other related metrics discussed in this Item 7.\nFollowing is a presentation of revenue, net income (loss), income before income taxes and discontinued operations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and the related margins on a consolidated basis and revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the Reis Services segment (see below for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for both the Reis Services segment and on a consolidated basis for each of the periods presented here).\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

revenue increased by approximately $709,000, or 6.1% over the fourth quarter of 2016. Total revenue increased by approximately $660,000 or 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the comparable 2016 annual period. Subscription revenue increased 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the 2016 period. The two factors that have led to our subscription revenue growth for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, and our improving growth trajectory over the course of 2017, include: (1) improvement in our trailing twelve-month (\u201cTTM\u201d) renewal rates; and (2) new business.\nRenewal Rates - The Company's December 31, 2017 TTM base renewal rate, including price increases, was 88.3% (for institutional subscribers, the base renewal rate, including price increases, was 89.7%). For the TTM ended December 31, 2016, the Company's base renewal rate, including price increases, was 85.7% (for institutional subscribers, the base renewal rate, including price increases, was 87.3%). During 2016, TTM renewal rates were negatively impacted by: the cancellation of contracts, primarily in the second quarter of 2016, associated with Reis's intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) compliance initiatives; from subscribers that exited the CRE business; and in selected cases, in response to our aggressive repricing on contract expirations. As the Company has worked to improve customer retention, poorer performing quarterly renewal rates have been replaced with higher rates in 2017, resulting in the aforementioned TTM renewal rate improvements. Although there may be quarterly variability, management expects further renewal rate improvement for the annual 2018 period over 2017.\nNew Business - Reis experienced strong levels of new business bookings in 2017. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 continued to be positively impacted by sales that were directly tied to recent product improvements, including wins associated with our expanded sales transaction database with investment sales brokers, property tax appeal firms and tax assessors.\nOther Revenue\nThe Company's other revenue includes: (1) non-subscription revenue custom data deliverables; and (2) one-time settlements. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 2.9% and 4.5%, respectively, of total revenue was generated from one-time settlements (in 2017 and 2016), and custom data deliverables (in 2016 only). A description of the revenue from Intellectual Property settlements and custom data deliverables follows.\nIntellectual Property Settlements - Reis continues to successfully resolve cases in which our intellectual property rights have been violated. In 2016 and 2017, the Company continued to be very active in protecting its intellectual property by pursuing firms and individuals who had previously gained unauthorized access to our services. The discovery of instances of unauthorized usage creates opportunities for Reis's compliance team to engage in productive conversations with firms regarding ongoing access to Reis data in accordance with the terms and conditions of a subscription agreement. Reis has developed a programmatic approach to promptly resolving cases of unauthorized usage and has devoted significant client services and account management resources to increase the renewal rates of IP infringement related accounts to levels typical of all other Reis subscribers. As a result of these compliance procedures, the Company has been able to generate revenue through either one-time settlement payments or by signing up the non-complying firm or individual to an annual or multi-year Reis SE subscription.\nRevenue from one-time settlement payments aggregated $1,388,000 and $931,000 in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Throughout 2017, as our compliance team continued to identify instances of unauthorized access, the period of unauthorized usage being identified was much shorter and report consumption was not as significant as cases that were settled in prior years. Management believes that compliance resolutions will yield a continuing and significant volume of subscription contracts and recurring revenue for the foreseeable future.\nCustom Data Deliverables - The Company recognized significant revenue in 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016 from custom data deliverables and related services for one of our existing Reis SE subscribers. The revenue recorded reflected the portion of the custom\ndata files that was delivered in June and December 2015 and February 2016, positively impacting results for the second and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Revenue related to these deliverables aggregated $1,200,000 in 2016 (all in the first quarter) and $4,519,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn 2016, Reis did not replicate similar custom data sales. Custom data sales generally, and the large 2015 contract specifically, created a higher level of volatility in our 2015 and 2016 revenue and earnings. In 2017, management was able to identify other opportunities to sell custom data files, but structured these sales as subscription agreements with periodic quarterly updates in order to record revenue ratably, consistent with how the Company recognizes revenue for Reis SE.\nDeferred Revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract\nTwo balance-sheet based metrics management utilizes are deferred revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract. Analyzing these amounts can provide additional insight into the Company's future financial performance. Deferred revenue, which is a GAAP basis accounting concept and is reported by the Company on the consolidated balance sheet, represents revenue from annual or longer term contracts for which we have billed and/or received payments from our subscribers related to services we will be providing over the remaining contract period. Aggregate Revenue Under Contract is the sum of deferred revenue and future revenue under non-cancellable contracts for which we do not yet have the contractual right to bill and excludes any future revenues expected to be derived from subscribers currently being billed on a monthly basis.\nDeferred revenue will be recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining life of a contract for subscriptions, or in the case of future custom reports or projects, will be recognized as revenue upon completion and delivery to the customer, provided no significant Company obligations remain. At any given date, both deferred revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract can be either positively or negatively influenced by: (1) the timing and dollar value of contracts signed and billed; (2) the quantity and timing of contracts that are multi-year; and (3) the impact of recording revenue ratably over the life of a multi-year contract, which moderates the effect of price increases after the first year. The following table reconciles deferred revenue to Aggregate Revenue Under Contract at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred revenue (GAAP basis)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 26,534,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 25,031,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amounts under non-cancellable contracts for which the Company does not yet have the contractual right to bill at the period end (A)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,470,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,928,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aggregate Revenue Under Contract\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,004,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,959,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (A)\u2003\u2002\u200aAmounts are billable subsequent to December 31 of each year and represent (i) non-cancellable contracts for subscribers with multi-year subscriptions where the future years are not yet billable, or (ii) subscribers with non-cancellable annual subscriptions with interim billing terms.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Included in Aggregate Revenue Under Contract at December 31, 2017 was approximately $35,878,000 related to amounts under contract for the forward twelve-month period through December 31, 2018. The remainder reflects amounts under contract beyond December 31, 2018. The forward twelve-month Aggregate Revenue Under Contract amount is approximately 74.5% of total revenue on a TTM basis at December 31, 2017. For comparison purposes, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, the forward twelve-month Aggregate Revenue Under Contract was $34,778,000 and $33,822,000, respectively, and as a percentage of that year's total revenue was approximately 73.2% and 66.5%, respectively.\nMulti-Year Contracts and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract - In order to increase the predictability of fees from our subscribers and Reis's revenue and cash flow, we have made a concerted effort to encourage multi-year contracts when appropriate, with terms of two or three years, and in some cases, four years. Over the past three years we have grown the percentage of revenue that is under multi-year contracts from approximately 33% at December 31, 2015 to 38% at December 31, 2016 and up to approximately 45% at December 31, 2017. The average life of multi-year contracts signed in each of the last four years was approximately 2.2 years. There are significant benefits, on a selective basis, of multi-year contracts, including locking in recurring subscription revenue for longer periods, thereby improving our renewal rates and increasing the predictability of future revenues. Multi-year contracts can also positively influence deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract, particularly as the number of multi-year contracts grows year-over-year. Operationally, multi-year contracts free up account management resources to focus on subscribers requiring a higher level of attention and upselling opportunities across our account base. Finally, multi-year deals also insulate us from competitive pressures and increase the likeliness that Reis data and analytics will become embedded in the work flow of our clients.\nIn accordance with GAAP, our revenue recognition policy is to record revenue ratably over the life of a subscriber contract. Therefore any increases in the price of the subscription after the first year of a multi-year contract are considered in the total amount being straight-\nlined over the contract term. If a multi-year contract includes pricing steps on and after the first anniversary, there will be increasing cash flow from the contract, but no growth in revenue during the subsequent years under that contract. There has been resulting variability in our growth rates from having such a significant segment of our subscriber base under multi-year agreements which negatively impacted 2016 performance and muted 2017 growth rates.\n2016 Revenue Performance\nAnnual 2016 financial results for Reis presented a difficult comparison against the substantial revenue and financial growth of 2015. Reis's performance in 2016 relative to the results for 2015 was impacted by four main factors: (1) revenues associated with significant custom data deliverables in 2015; (2) a decline in the TTM renewal rates; (3) a reduction in revenue from IP compliance initiatives; and (4) multi-year contracts and their flattening effect on growth rates.\nSubscription Revenue\nTotal revenue decreased by approximately $(3,360,000), or (6.6)%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable 2015 period; however, subscription revenue in 2016 grew 3.8% over the 2015 annual period.\nRenewal Rates - For the TTM ended December 31, 2016, the Company's base renewal rate, including price increases, was 85.7% (for institutional subscribers, the base renewal rate, including price increases, was 87.3%). For the TTM ended December 31, 2015, the Company's base renewal rate, including price increases, was 91.9% (for institutional subscribers, the base renewal rate, including price increases, was 93.9%). Reis's 2016 TTM renewal rates were negatively impacted by the cancellation of contracts (most significantly in the second quarter of 2016) signed in 2014 and 2015 associated with Reis's IP compliance initiatives, from customer losses from subscribers that exited the CRE business and from aggressive repricing on contract expirations.\nMulti-Year Contracts - As stated above, we have been increasing the amount of revenue that is under multi-year contracts over each of the last three years. There has been resulting variability in our growth rates from having such a significant segment of our subscriber base under multi-year agreements which negatively impacted 2016 performance.\nOther Revenue\nThe Company's other revenue included: (1) non-subscription custom data deliverables; and (2) one-time settlements. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 4.5%, and 14.1%, respectively, of total revenue was generated from custom data deliverables and one-time settlements. A description of the revenue from custom data deliverables and Intellectual Property settlements follows.\nCustom Data Deliverables - As noted above, the Company recognized significant revenue in 2015 from custom data deliverables and related services for one of our existing Reis SE subscribers. The revenue recorded reflected the portion of the custom data files that was delivered in June and December 2015 and February 2016, positively impacting results for the second and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Revenue related to these deliverables aggregated $1,200,000 in 2016 (all in the first quarter) and $4,519,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIntellectual Property Settlements - Revenue from one-time settlement payments aggregated $931,000 and $2,649,000 in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although identified instances of non-compliance remained steady, the frequency and dollar amount of one-time settlements were lower in 2016 than in 2015.\n2017 Earnings Metrics - Net (Loss) Income, Income before Income Taxes, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Reis Services EBITDA\nThe Company had a net (loss) of $(4,548,000) and $(230,000) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had a net (loss) of $(3,158,000) and net income of $2,781,000, respectively. The decrease of $4,318,000 and $5,939,000 in the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to an incremental income tax expense recorded at December 31, 2017 of $5,142,000 from the change in the Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and the resulting reduction to the Company's deferred tax assets to reflect the rate change (as required by the Tax Act). See additional information about revenue and expense variances in this Item 7 and for additional information on taxes, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements include elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company reported income before income taxes of $1,038,000 and a (loss) before income taxes of $(141,000) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in income before income taxes of $1,179,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 over the 2016 comparable period is primarily a result of the revenue increase of $709,000 (as described above), as well as operating expense decreases from quarter to quarter of $765,000 (described below), offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense of\n$254,000, increased stock-based compensation of $36,000 and an increase in net interest expense of $5,000. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had income before income taxes of $2,433,000 and $4,734,000, respectively. The decrease of $(2,301,000) in the annual 2017 period from the 2016 annual period is primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1,426,000 (associated with increased amortization from database and website development in 2017, as well as a full year's worth of depreciation expense in 2017 from the leasehold improvements and other office assets associated with the new operations and corporate headquarters spaces in 2016), an increase in operating expenses of $1,382,000 (primarily from employment related cost increases), an increase in stock-based compensation of $112,000 and an increase in net interest expense of $41,000, offset by the $660,000 increase in revenue (as described above).\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $3,784,000, an increase of $1,474,000, or 63.8%, from the fourth quarter 2016 amount. The increase is a result of the quarterly revenue increase of $709,000 (as described above), as well as expense decreases from the 2016 period of $765,000. The expense reduction from the 2016 fourth quarter to 2017 is a result of a decrease in headcount and other cost efficiencies. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $12,827,000, a decrease of $(722,000), or (5.3)%, from the comparable 2016 annual period. The decrease in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects increased operating expenses of $1,382,000, offset by the annual revenue growth of $660,000 (as described above). Operating expense increases in the annual 2017 period are a result of employment related cost increases over the 2016 period. The consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.9% and 26.6% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as compared to the reported consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.0% and 28.5% for the comparable 2016 periods.\nReis Services EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $4,328,000, an increase of $1,663,000, or 62.4%, from the fourth quarter 2016 amount. The increase is a result of the quarterly revenue increase of $709,000, as well as expense decreases from the 2016 fourth quarter of $954,000. The expense reduction from the 2016 fourth quarter to 2017 is a result of a decrease in headcount and other cost efficiencies. Reis Services EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $15,134,000, a decrease of $(403,000), or (2.6)% from the comparable 2016 annual period. The decrease in Reis Services EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects increased operating expenses of $1,063,000, offset by the annual revenue growth of $660,000. Operating expense increases in the annual 2017 period are a result of employment related cost increases over the 2016 period. Reis Services EBITDA margins were 35.3% and 31.4% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as compared to the reported Reis Services EBITDA margins of 23.1% and 32.7% for the 2016 comparable periods.\nEarnings Metrics - Net Income, Income before Income Taxes and Discontinued Operations, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Reis Services EBITDA\nNet income was $2,781,000 and $10,305,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $(7,524,000) in the year ended December 31, 2016 is a result of the $3,360,000 revenue decline from period to period and operating expense increases described below of $2,572,000, but also includes the impact of increased depreciation and amortization expense in the year ended December 31, 2016 over 2015 of $1,052,000 from increased amortizable website and database intangible assets and increased spending on furniture, fixtures and equipment. In addition, this includes the impact of increased stock-based compensation of $326,000 and an increase in net interest expense of $32,000, as well as a reduction in income from discontinued operations of $2,234,000 as a result of the finalization of activities from discontinued operations in the 2015 period. This is offset by a reduction in income tax expense (from lower taxable income in the 2016 periods) of $(2,052,000) in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding 2015 period.\nIncome before income taxes and discontinued operations was $4,734,000 and $12,076,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $(7,342,000) in the year ended December 31, 2016 is a result of the $3,360,000 revenue decline from period to period and operating expense increases described below of $2,572,000, but also includes the impact of increased depreciation and amortization expense in the year ended December 31, 2016 over 2015 of $1,052,000 from increased amortizable website and database intangible assets and increased spending on furniture, fixtures and equipment, as compared to the corresponding 2015 period. In addition, this includes the impact of increased stock-based compensation of $326,000 and an increase in net interest expense of $32,000.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $13,549,000, a decrease of $(5,932,000), or (30.5)%, from the comparable 2015 period. The decrease primarily resulted from the decline in total revenue of $3,360,000 as described above and the impact of total operating expenses, which grew by $2,572,000 from the comparable 2015 annual period. The consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margins were 28.5% and 38.3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nReis Services EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $15,537,000, a decrease of $(6,537,000), or (29.6)%, from the comparable 2015 period. This decrease primarily resulted from the decline in total revenue of $3,360,000 as described above. Total operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses) grew by $3,177,000, or 11.0%, in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016. Expense increases are primarily due to increased employment related costs and rent related expenses. In particular, total rent expense increased $1,682,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016, over the corresponding 2015 annual period. This amount reflects the increase in both the square footage being leased and the higher price per square foot, and includes the effect of overlapping leases from the duplication of rent and other occupancy costs (aggregating approximately $721,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016). In addition, the Company incurred $118,000 of move related costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, which, with the effect of the duplication of rent, has contributed to the reduction in our EBITDA and EBITDA margins in those periods.\nThe Reis Services EBITDA margin was 32.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 43.4% for the 2015 period. The margin in the year ended December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by the custom data deliverables and other revenue items described previously which had higher margins than our historic sales of Reis SE subscriptions. The 2016 margins were lower than historic norms as a result of the combination of increased expenses and lower total revenue as discussed herein.\nReconciliations of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as earnings (net income (loss)) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation. Although EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, senior management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure operational and management performance. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate supplemental financial measures to be considered in addition to the reported GAAP basis financial information, which may assist investors in evaluating and understanding: (1) the performance of the Reis Services segment, the primary business of the Company and (2) the Company's continuing consolidated results, from year to year or period to period, as applicable. Further, these measures provide the reader with the ability to understand our operational performance while isolating non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as other non-operating items, such as interest income, interest expense and income taxes and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, isolates non-cash charges for stock-based compensation. Management also believes that disclosing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide better comparability to other companies in the information services sector. However, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented both for the Reis Services segment and on a consolidated basis. We believe that these metrics, for Reis Services, provide the reader with valuable information for evaluating the financial performance of the core Reis Services business, excluding public company costs, and for making assessments about the intrinsic value of that stand-alone business to a potential acquirer. Management primarily monitors and measures its performance, and is compensated, based on the results of the Reis Services segment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, on a consolidated basis, allow the reader to make assessments about the current trading value of the Company's common stock, including expenses related to operating as a public company. However, investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for net income (loss), income from continuing operations, operating income, or any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, income from continuing operations, follow for each identified period on a segment basis (including the Reis Services segment), as well as on a consolidated basis:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

were approximately $48,190,000 and $12,565,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, which resulted in a gross profit for the Reis Services segment of approximately $35,625,000. Amortization expense included in cost of sales (for the database intangible asset) was approximately $3,731,000 during this period. Total revenue and related cost of sales were approximately $47,530,000 and $10,999,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, which resulted in a gross profit for the Reis Services segment of approximately $36,531,000. Amortization expense included in cost of sales (for the database intangible asset) was approximately $2,853,000 during this period. See \u201c- Critical Business Metrics\u201d for a discussion of the variances and trends in revenue and EBITDA of the Reis Services segment. The increase in cost of sales of $1,566,000 resulted from greater employment related costs, specifically from hiring during 2016 and early 2017 of $688,000, and an $878,000 increase in amortization expense for database costs (from product enhancements such as affordable housing and the expansion of data included in our sales offerings).\nSales and marketing expenses were approximately $12,626,000 and $11,879,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and solely represented costs of the Reis Services segment. Amortization expense included in sales and marketing expenses (for the customer relationships intangible asset) was approximately $919,000 and $935,000 during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in sales and marketing expenses between the two periods of approximately $747,000 resulted from greater employment related costs in the 2017 period of $763,000, including costs associated with new hires in sales management, sales enablement and marketing, offset by a $16,000 decrease in amortization expense for the customer relationships intangible asset.\nProduct development expenses were approximately $4,696,000 and $4,167,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and solely represented costs of the Reis Services segment. Amortization expense included in product development expenses (for the website intangible asset) was approximately $2,381,000 and $1,955,000 during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Product development costs increased $529,000, primarily due to increased amortization expense for the website intangible asset of $426,000 and greater employment related costs in the 2017 period of $103,000.\nGeneral and administrative expenses of approximately $15,743,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 included current period expenses of approximately $12,507,000, depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $1,025,000 for furniture, fixtures and equipment, and approximately $2,211,000 of net non-cash compensation expense. The net non-cash compensation expense was comprised of equity awards for employees and directors. General and administrative expenses of approximately $15,665,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 included current period expenses of approximately $12,679,000, depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $887,000 for the lease value intangible asset and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and approximately $2,099,000 of net non-cash compensation expense. Excluding the non-cash expenses, the net decrease in general and administrative expenses of $172,000 was due to reduced legal fees and lower occupancy costs in 2017, offset by greater employment related costs in 2017. The net increase in depreciation expense of $138,000 in 2017 over the corresponding 2016 period is a result of the build out and furnishing of our new corporate headquarters which was completed in October 2016.\nInterest expense of $130,000 and $108,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was comprised of unused facility fees and deferred financing cost amortization on the Revolver. There was no outstanding balance on the Revolver during 2017 and 2016.\nIncome tax expense of $5,591,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 reflected deferred Federal tax expense of $5,736,000, current Federal AMT of $20,000 and current state and local tax expense of $225,000, offset by a deferred state and local tax benefit of $(390,000). Income tax expense of $1,953,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 reflected deferred Federal tax expense of $1,704,000, current Federal AMT of $147,000, current state and local tax expense of $40,000, and deferred state and local tax expense of $62,000.\nTax expense and the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was significantly impacted by the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), enacted on December 22, 2017 by the U.S. Federal government. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from the existing maximum rate of 35%, effective January 1, 2018. We remeasured our deferred tax assets as a result of the Federal rate reduction and recorded a provisional estimate of $5,142,000 at December 31, 2017 to reduce the deferred tax asset balance. While we are able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of the reduction in the Federal corporate rate, the final impact of the Tax Act may differ from these estimates, including, but not limited to, changes in our interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by the IRS, and return to provision differences and state rate adjustments. We are continuing to gather additional information to determine the final impact.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTotal revenue and related cost of sales were approximately $47,530,000 and $10,999,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, which resulted in a gross profit for the Reis Services segment of approximately $36,531,000. Amortization expense included in cost of sales (for the database intangible asset) was approximately $2,853,000 during this period. Total revenue and related cost of sales were approximately $50,890,000 and $9,081,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, which resulted in a gross profit for the Reis Services segment of approximately $41,809,000. Amortization expense included in cost of sales was approximately $2,103,000 during this period. See \u201c- Critical Business Metrics\u201d for a discussion of the variances and trends in revenue and EBITDA of the Reis Services segment. The increase in cost of sales of $1,918,000 resulted from greater employment related costs, specifically from hiring during 2015 and 2016, coupled with compensation increases and higher benefit costs than in the 2015 period of $1,168,000 and a $750,000 increase in amortization expense for database costs.\nSales and marketing expenses were approximately $11,879,000 and $11,701,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and solely represented costs of the Reis Services segment. Amortization expense included in sales and marketing expenses (for the customer relationships intangible asset) was approximately $935,000 and $949,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net increase in sales and marketing expenses between the two periods of approximately $178,000 resulted from increases in employment related costs due to additional headcount related to hiring in sales management, sales enablement and marketing, offset by lower commission expense from the large custom data sale in the 2015 period (with no sale of a corresponding magnitude in the 2016 period) and lower performance based bonus accruals in the 2016 period.\nProduct development expenses were approximately $4,167,000 and $3,711,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and solely represented costs of the Reis Services segment. Amortization expense included in product development expenses (for the website intangible asset) was approximately $1,955,000 and $1,793,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Product development costs increased $456,000, primarily due to increased employment related costs from hiring during 2015 and 2016, coupled with compensation increases and higher benefit costs than in the 2015 period of $294,000 and a $162,000 increase in amortization expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses of approximately $15,665,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 included current period expenses of approximately $12,679,000, depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $887,000 for the lease value intangible asset and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and approximately $2,099,000 of net non-cash compensation expense. The net non-cash compensation expense was comprised of equity awards for employees and directors. General and administrative expenses of approximately $14,267,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 included current period expenses of approximately $11,762,000, depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $732,000 for the lease value intangible asset and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and approximately $1,773,000 of net non-cash compensation expense. Excluding the non-cash expenses, the net increase in general and administrative expenses of $917,000 was influenced by increased occupancy related costs from the office space expansion (approximately $1,682,000, of which $721,000 was the effect of overlapping leases and the duplication of rent expense), increases for legal fees (approximately $374,000), move related costs (approximately $118,000) and increased employment related costs and other general expenses (approximately $290,000), offset by lower performance based bonus expense in the period (approximately $1,547,000).\nInterest expense of $108,000 and $92,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was comprised of unused facility fees and deferred financing cost amortization on the Revolver. There was no outstanding balance on the Revolver during 2016 or 2015.\nIncome tax expense of $1,953,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 reflected deferred Federal tax expense of $1,704,000, current Federal AMT of $147,000, current state and local tax expense of $40,000, and deferred state and local tax expense of $62,000. Income tax expense of $4,005,000 for continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 reflected deferred Federal tax expense of $3,832,000, current state and local tax expense of $452,000 and current Federal AMT of $234,000, offset by a deferred state and local tax benefit of $513,000. The deferred state and local tax benefit reflected a change in the New York City law which resulted in a variation between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate in the period.\nIncome from discontinued operations was $2,234,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and primarily reflected $4,839,000 of recoveries from settlements with certain parties to the Gold Peak litigation (as more fully described in Note 3 to the Company's consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K), offset by legal and professional fees of $1,196,000 and income tax expense of $1,409,000. There were no discontinued operations activities in the 2016 period.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The net deferred tax asset was approximately $12,072,000\nand $16,815,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, all of which was classified as non-current. The significant portion of the deferred tax items relates to deferred tax assets including NOL carryforwards, Federal AMT credit carryforwards and stock-based compensation, with the remainder of the deferred tax items relating to liabilities resulting from the intangible assets recorded at the time of the Merger. The significant component of the decrease in the deferred tax asset value in 2017 is due to the re-measurement as described above.\nThe Company had Federal NOL carryforwards aggregating approximately $37,859,000 at December 31, 2017, as well as significant state and local NOL carryforwards. These NOLs included amounts generated subsequent to the Merger (including a substantial NOL realized during the year ended December 31, 2012 as a result of the Gold Peak litigation settlement, discussed in Note 3 to the Company's consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K), losses from the Reis Services business prior to the Merger and the Company's operating losses prior to the Merger. Approximately $5,140,000 of these Federal NOLs are subject to an annual Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation of $2,779,000, whereas the remaining balance of approximately $32,719,000 is not subject to the limitation. The enactment of a 2014 New York State law and a 2015 New York City law discussed above limit the amount of existing NOLs which could be used each year in those jurisdictions; however, all such NOLs are expected to be fully utilized in the future.\nThe next NOL expiration for the Company is in 2024 for approximately $2,513,000 of Federal NOLs. Included in the Federal NOLs at December 31, 2017 is approximately $1,723,000 attributable to excess tax deductions on equity award activity in prior years. Prior to January 1, 2017, the tax benefits attributable to those NOLs were credited directly to additional paid in capital when utilized to offset taxes payable. In 2017, these NOLs were recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon adoption of ASU 2016-09 (as more fully described in Note 2 to the Company's consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K).\nA valuation allowance is required to reduce deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result of management's evaluation of the Company's future operations, it has been determined that no valuation allowance was necessary at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company's reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest, was $31,000 and $154,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The unrecognized tax benefits as well as related interest was included in general and administrative expenses. The Company recorded additional expense, including interest, of $3,000 in 2017, a reduction in expense of $(4,000) in 2016 and additional expense, including interest, of $70,000 in 2015.\nFor additional information related to income taxes, see Note 6 to the Company's consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe core Reis Services business has traditionally generated significant cash annually; and we expect it to continue to do so. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance aggregated approximately $19,671,000 at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $(1,820,000) from the December 31, 2016 balance of approximately $21,491,000. Although the Company had cash flows provided by its operating activities of $16,156,000, the Company's cash position decreased in 2017 as a result of: (1) making investments in its websites and databases of $8,583,000, (2) paying aggregate dividends of approximately $7,876,000, (3) repurchasing approximately $3,421,000 of the Company's common stock under the repurchase program, and (4) spending on tenant improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment of approximately $1,030,000. This was partially offset by the receipt of $2,935,000 in proceeds associated with the exercise of 285,000 options in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company's short-term and long-term liquidity requirements include: current operating and capitalizable costs, including accounts payable and other accrued expenses; near-term product development and enhancement of the website and databases either through building with Company resources or through acquisitions; operating leases; growth in operating expenses, including possible further increase in the number of Reis employees and additional resources devoted to our sales and marketing efforts; other costs, including public company expenses not included in the Reis Services segment; the resolution of open tax years with state and local tax authorities; the payment of state and local taxes based on income (in excess of limitation amounts) and tax on capital; payment of employee taxes on vested equity awards, for which the employee uses shares to settle his/her minimum withholding tax obligations with the Company; the use of cash for the payment of quarterly dividends; and repurchases of shares of Reis common stock (at December 31, 2017, approximately $435,000 remained available to be purchased under our current authorization). The Company expects to meet these short-term and long-term liquidity requirements generally through the use of available cash and cash generated from subscription revenue of Reis Services and, if necessary, with borrowings under the Revolver, and/or proceeds from the sale of Reis stock.\nIn January 2016, Reis Services and Capital One executed an amended and restated loan and security agreement for a $20,000,000 revolving credit facility, which expires on January 28, 2019. For additional information regarding the Revolver, see Note 5 to the Company's consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOn June 24, 2015, the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 was declared effective. The shelf registration statement permits the offering, issuance and sale of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $75,000,000 of the Company's stock from time to time for three years through June 24, 2018. Any determinations about the issuance of new common shares will be at the discretion of the Company's Board and the use of proceeds, unless otherwise indicated, will be for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions. Management will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds. The Company has no immediate plans to issue shares under the shelf registration statement.\nThe Company has NOLs that it expects to utilize against future Federal, state and local taxable income. The use of certain NOLs for New York State and New York City purposes will be subject to an annual limitation and, therefore, any taxable income in excess of the limitation will be subject to tax. Tax payments related to 2018 are expected to be for state and local taxes based on income, in excess of limitation amounts, and tax on capital. In 2021, the Company expects that it could receive approximately $1,737,000 of cash from existing AMT NOLs that will not be utilized prior to that time as described under the Tax Act.\nThe Company may determine to use its cash to: (1) acquire or invest in other databases or information companies that have logical adjacencies or complementary products or services; (2) repurchase additional shares of Reis common stock; or (3) pay a special dividend, or increase its recurring quarterly dividend. There can be no assurance that the Company will use its cash for any of these purposes during 2018, or thereafter.\nMaterial Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ending December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Aggregate </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 and 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 and 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal and interest payments for the Revolver (A)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future contractual minimum operating lease payments (B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 3,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 6,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 7,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 8,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 25,650 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>(A) </td> <td>Includes unused facility fees of $50,000 for 2018. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>(B) </td> <td>For additional information related to the Company's operating leases, see Item 2. Properties. </td> </tr>\n</table> Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet liabilities or obligations which are required to be disclosed by the SEC's rules and regulations.\nDiscontinued Operations Impact on Liquidity\nCash flows from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 were included in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the operating activities section in accordance with the applicable accounting literature. Cash flows from discontinued operations during 2015 were a net inflow of approximately $3,724,000, including $4,779,000 of recoveries, offset by $1,055,000 of cash used for legal and professional fees incurred as part of our cash recovery efforts from insurance companies and other responsible parties in connection with the Gold Peak litigation. As of December 31, 2015, the Company entered into the final settlement agreement related to its Gold Peak recovery efforts, bringing closure to this process. Therefore, there were no cash flows from discontinued operations during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017. For additional information pertaining to our discontinued operations, see Note 3 to the Company's consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOther Items Impacting Liquidity\nDividends\nThe Company commenced a quarterly dividend program in the second quarter of 2014 when it declared and paid an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per common share. The Company increased the dividends declared and paid to $0.14 per common share for all four quarters of 2015, and increased the dividend declared and paid to $0.17 per common share for all four quarters of 2016 and 2017. Dividends paid by the Company aggregated approximately $7,876,000, $7,747,000 and $6,338,000, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although the Company anticipates paying a quarterly dividend hereafter, future dividends are subject to approval by the Board.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn August 30, 2016, the Company's Board authorized a repurchase program of shares of the Company's common stock up to an aggregate of $5,000,000. Purchases under the program may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Depending on market conditions, financial developments and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time, or from time to time, without prior notice and may be expanded without prior notice. The Company may make purchases pursuant to a trading plan under Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1, permitting open market purchases of common stock during blackout periods.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company purchased an aggregate of 182,028 shares of common stock for approximately $3,421,000, or an average price of $18.80 per share, leaving approximately $435,000 at December 31, 2017 that may be used to purchase additional shares under the repurchase program in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company purchased an aggregate of 54,176 shares of common stock for approximately $1,144,000, or an average price of $21.11 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock.\nStock Plans\nThe Company has adopted certain incentive plans for the purpose of attracting and retaining the Company's directors, officers and employees by having the ability to issue options, RSUs, or stock awards. Awards granted under the Company's incentive plans expire ten years from the date of grant and vest over periods ranging generally from three to five years for employees.\nIn 2016 and 2015, the Board authorized the use of cash to settle minimum employee withholding tax obligations on vested RSUs in the respective periods. The net effect was a reduction on the issuance of shares at those vesting dates. The Company utilized approximately $701,000 and $993,000 of cash in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with RSU vestings. Unlike the RSU vestings in 2016 and 2015, for RSUs vesting in 2017 and February 2018, the Company did not use cash to settle minimum employee withholding tax obligations. The Company may, in the future, decide to use cash to settle these cash obligations.\nFor additional information related to stock plans and other incentives, see Note 8 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nChanges in Cash Flows\nCash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,156,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,802,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,235,648 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,613,502) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,325,189) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,187,149) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,362,660) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,644,279) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,135,620) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> (1,819,973) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> (7,167,370) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 10,912,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Comparison of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $354,000 from $15,802,000 provided in the 2016 period to $16,156,000 provided in the 2017 period. This net increase was primarily the result of improved operating cash flow in the 2017 period (due to growth in revenue and moderating cash expenses).\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $3,712,000 from $13,325,000 used in the 2016 period to $9,613,000 used in the 2017 period. This change resulted primarily from a $3,787,000 decrease in purchases of furniture, fixtures and equipment (as the 2016 period included spending associated with the build out of new corporate and operations office space) offset by a $75,000 increase in cash used in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period for website and database development costs for continuing product development initiatives.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $8,363,000 and $9,644,000 in the 2017 and 2016 periods, respectively. The 2017 period includes approximately $7,876,000 for dividends declared and paid in the year ended December 31, 2017, $3,421,000 used to repurchase shares of the Company's common stock, offset by proceeds received from employees for option exercises of $2,935,000. The 2016 period includes approximately $7,747,000 for dividends declared and paid in the year ended December 31, 2016, $701,000 used to settle\nminimum employee withholding tax obligations on vested RSUs, $206,000 of deferred financing costs related to the expansion and extension of the Revolver and $1,144,000 to repurchase shares of the Company's common stock, offset by proceeds received from employees for option exercises of $153,000.\nComparison of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $(8,434,000) from $24,236,000 provided in the 2015 period to $15,802,000 provided in the 2016 period. This decrease was primarily the result of decreased operating cash flow of $(4,816,000) from the Reis Services segment from $23,936,000 provided in the 2015 period to $19,120,000 provided in the 2016 period (due to declines in revenue, EBITDA and deferred revenue as described elsewhere herein), as well as the impact of net cash provided from discontinued operations due to the collection of $3,724,000 of litigation recoveries in the 2015 period with no 2016 equivalent.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $7,138,000 from $6,187,000 used in the 2015 period to $13,325,000 used in the 2016 period. This change resulted primarily from a $4,436,000 increase in spending on leasehold improvements and purchases of furniture, fixtures and equipment in the 2016 period for office space expansion, coupled with a $2,705,000 increase of cash invested primarily in our databases related to the expansion of our CRE sales transaction database, the addition of affordable housing as our ninth property type and other data expansion efforts.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $9,644,000 and $7,136,000 in the 2016 and 2015 periods, respectively. The 2016 period includes approximately $7,747,000 for dividends declared and paid in the year ended December 31, 2016, $701,000 used to settle minimum employee withholding tax obligations on vested RSUs, $206,000 of deferred financing costs related to the expansion and extension of the Revolver and $1,144,000 to repurchase shares of the Company's common stock, offset by proceeds received from employees for option exercises of $153,000. The 2015 period includes approximately $6,338,000 for dividends declared and paid in the year ended December 31, 2015, $993,000 used to settle minimum employee withholding tax obligations on vested RSUs and $89,000 related to costs incurred in connection with the shelf registration statement filed in the second quarter of 2015, offset by proceeds received from employees for option exercises of $284,000.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement has identified the following accounting policies which it believes are critical in understanding the Company's activities, financial position and operating results.\nIntangible Assets, Amortization and Impairment\nWebsite Development Costs\nThe Company expenses all internet website costs incurred during the preliminary project stage. Thereafter, all direct external and internal development and implementation costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated useful lives, not exceeding three years. Amortization expense for all capitalized website development costs is charged to product development expense.\nDatabase Costs\nThe Company capitalizes costs for the development of its database in connection with the identification and addition of new real estate properties and sale transactions which provide a future economic benefit. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over a three or five year period. Costs of updating and maintaining information on existing properties in the database are expensed as incurred. Amortization expense for all capitalized database costs is charged to cost of sales.\nCustomer Relationships\nThe value ascribed to customer relationships acquired at the time of the Merger is amortized over 15 years on an accelerated basis and is charged to sales and marketing expense.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment\nGoodwill and a major portion of the other intangible assets were recorded at the time of the Merger. As a result of the tax treatment of the Merger, goodwill and the acquired intangible assets are not deductible for income tax purposes.\nGoodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually, or after a triggering event has occurred, requiring such an assessment. A qualitative assessment can be utilized. If the qualitative assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely\nthan not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, no further evaluation would be necessary. If, after performing the qualitative assessment, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned with the reporting unit's carrying value is performed. The fair values used in this evaluation would be estimates based upon market projections for the reporting unit. These market projections would utilize a number of estimates and assumptions, such as EBITDA multiples, market comparisons, and quoted market prices. If the fair value of the reporting unit were to exceed its carrying value, goodwill would not be deemed to be impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge will be recorded based on the difference, with the impairment charge limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company utilized the qualitative assessment for its 2017, 2016 and 2015 evaluations. There was no goodwill impairment identified in 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nIntangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used. In addition, the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets are reviewed when indicators of impairment are present. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset would be considered impaired. An impairment charge would be determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value, with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period. There was no intangible asset impairment identified in 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nRevenue Recognition and Related Items\nThe Company's subscription revenue is derived principally from subscriptions to its web-based services for its Reis SE product and is recognized as revenue ratably over the related contractual period, which is typically one year but can be as long as 48 months. Revenue from Reis Portfolio CRE for contracts entered into prior to September 16, 2015, represents the Company's 50% share of the value of the subscription and is recognized as revenue ratably over the related contractual period consistent with the treatment for the Reis SE product. Revenue from Reis Portfolio CRE contracts entered into after September 16, 2015 represents the Company's 100% share of the value of the subscription as a result of the purchase of the intellectual property of the Reis Portfolio CRE product and is recognized as revenue ratably over the related contractual period consistent with the treatment for the Reis SE product. Multiple contracts executed with one customer are accounted for as separate arrangements. Revenue from ReisReports is recognized monthly as billed for monthly subscribers, or recognized as revenue ratably over the related contractual period for subscriptions in excess of one month.\nThe Company's other revenue includes: (1) non-subscription custom data deliverables; and (2) one-time settlements. Revenue from ad-hoc and non-subscription custom reports or projects is recognized upon completion and delivery to the customers, provided that no significant Company obligations remain. Revenue from settlements for prior unlicensed usage is recognized at the time of the settlement when collectability is reasonably assured.\nDeferred revenue represents the portion of a subscription billed or collected in advance under the terms of the respective contract, which will be recognized in future periods. If a customer does not meet the payment obligations of a contract, any related accounts receivable and deferred revenue are written off at that time and the net amount, after considering any recovery of accounts receivable, is charged to cost of sales.\nCost of sales of subscription revenue principally consists of salaries and related expenses for the Company's researchers who collect, analyze and maintain the commercial real estate data that is the basis for the Company's information services. Additionally, cost of sales includes expenses from the amortization of the database intangible asset.\nInterest revenue is recorded on an accrual basis.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d). ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. Under ASU 2014-09, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. As such, the Company will recognize the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance as an adjustment to its opening balance of retained earnings, and prior periods will not be retrospectively restated.\nThe Company has completed its assessment of changes from adopting the new standard, which included a detailed review of contractual terms for all of its significant revenue streams. The Company currently recognizes subscription revenue ratably over the subscription period. Under the updated standard, subscriptions represent a series of performance obligations that are delivered over time, primarily on a stand-ready basis. As a result, the Company's subscription revenue meets the criteria for revenue recognition over time and will continue to be recognized ratably under ASU 2014-09. The cumulative effect of adopting the guidance as it relates to revenue recognition will not result in a material adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption.\nAdditionally, the Company's evaluation considered the impact of the new standard on accounting for certain incremental costs associated with obtaining contracts with customers, such as commissions and related payroll taxes. The new standard requires these costs to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the asset. Currently, these costs are expensed as incurred. As a result, the Company will capitalize these costs. The amortization period associated with such costs is approximately four years for the incremental commission costs associated with acquiring a new customer. For commission costs associated with renewal contracts, the amortization period is the contract term.\nThe Company expects to record, on a pre-tax basis, an asset of approximately $3,100,000, a liability of approximately $800,000 and a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $2,300,000 upon adoption of the new revenue standard as a result of capitalizing commissions.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are estimated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances with respect to deferred income tax assets are recorded when deemed appropriate and adjusted based upon periodic evaluations. There was no valuation allowance with respect to deferred income taxes at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nThe Company evaluates its tax positions in accordance with applicable current accounting literature. Recognition of uncertain tax positions (step one) occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that more likely than not will be realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained, statutes close or there is a satisfactory resolution of the tax position.\nFor more information regarding income taxes, see Note 6 to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this filing.", "summary": "- The provided table represents the distribution of students' preferred mode of instruction in a graduate course based on their gender and race/ethnicity.\n- Overall, the majority of students prefer in-person instruction (67%) compared to online instruction (33%).\n- Within each gender and race/ethnicity category, the preferences are relatively similar, with the majority of students across all groups preferring in-person instruction.\n- There are some variations in preferences among different groups:\n  - For example, while the majority of Asian students (86%) and White students (80%) prefer in-person instruction, approximately half of Hispanic students (54%) and Black students (54%) prefer online instruction.\n  - Additionally, there is a slight preference for in-person instruction among male students (69%) compared to female students (65%).\n- These findings suggest that while students generally prefer in-person instruction, there are variations in preferences based on students' gender and race/ethnicity. \n\nWould you like me to help you with anything else regarding this table?", "item_7_tables": "Table 112: <table> <tr> <td>

"item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nManagement Summary\nOver the course of the year, the Company recorded incremental quarterly improvements in key financial metrics. Reis started the year with a first quarter decline in revenue and ended with positive revenue growth for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. Revenue declined in the first quarter of 2017 by (5.4)%; improved in the second quarter of 2017 by 0.8%; accelerated by 4.8% in the third quarter of 2017; and grew by 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to each respective 2016 quarter. These improving trends also occurred over the course of 2017 in income before taxes, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Reis Services EBITDA. These advances resulted from improving renewal rates (the overall renewal rate improved to 88.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017) and revenue from new business. All of these metrics will be discussed in greater detail in this section.\nDuring 2017, the Company also made significant product and data enhancements. Reis's database and analytical tools have historically covered the nine key property types most important to real estate professionals focused on the U.S. CRE market (apartment, office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage, seniors housing, student housing and affordable housing), providing up to 38 years of trend analysis and market forecasts for up to 275 metropolitan markets and thousands of submarkets. With the completion of a multi-year initiative to expand upon this cornerstone asset, Reis now offers market information, transaction data and building insights for all commercial properties throughout the nation, regardless of location, size, or use type. The achievement of \u201cEvery Property, Everywhere\u201d positions Reis to serve all CRE professionals and use-cases both within and beyond the Company's traditional property types and coverage boundaries. In parallel with the development of \u201cEvery Property, Everywhere,\u201d the Company has also built a new API, a delivery system that embeds Reis's data (legacy and newly launched) into any client's and prospect's internal system, regardless of platform.\nThe completion of this expansion of coverage in February 2018 affords Reis the opportunity to sell to new user groups within current client firms, and to accelerate sales among tens of thousands of prospect firms, including from investment sales brokerages, tax assessors, tax appeal professionals, and other commercial real estate professionals involved in transactions, asset and portfolio management. This achievement was only possible through the measured step up in investments in our database in recent years.\nCritical Business Metrics\nManagement considers certain metrics in evaluating its consolidated results and the performance of the Reis Services segment. These metrics are revenue, revenue growth, EBITDA (which is earnings (net income (loss)) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), EBITDA growth, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA (which is net income (loss) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation), Adjusted EBITDA growth and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Other important metrics that management considers include cash flow generation as well as the visibility into future performance as supported by our deferred revenue and other related metrics discussed in this Item 7.\nFollowing is a presentation of revenue, net income (loss), income before income taxes and discontinued operations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and the related margins on a consolidated basis and revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the Reis Services segment (see below for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for both the Reis Services segment and on a consolidated basis for each of the periods presented here).\n\n (amounts in thousands, excluding percentages) \n Revenue Performance - Metrics\nIn order to provide additional insight into our revenue, we have disaggregated total revenue into two components: \u201cSubscription\u201d and \u201cOther.\u201d Other revenue specifically includes revenue related to contracts for one-time custom data deliverables and one-time fees for settlements of previous unauthorized usage of Reis data. The following tables present subscription revenue, other revenue and total revenue for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n (amounts in thousands, excluding percentages) \n\n\n (A) Other revenue includes: (1) non-subscription custom data deliverables; and (2) one-time settlements.  2017 Revenue Performance\nSubscription Revenue\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, total revenue increased by approximately $709,000, or 6.1% over the fourth quarter of 2016. Total revenue increased by approximately $660,000 or 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the comparable 2016 annual period. Subscription revenue increased 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the 2016 period. The two factors that have led to our subscription revenue growth for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, and our improving growth trajectory over the course of 2017, include: (1) improvement in our trailing twelve-month (\u201cTTM\u201d) renewal rates; and (2) new business.\nRenewal Rates - The Company's December 31, 2017 TTM base renewal rate, including price increases, was 88.3% (for institutional subscribers, the base renewal rate, including price increases, was 89.7%). For the TTM ended December 31, 2016, the Company's base renewal rate, including price increases, was 85.7% (for institutional subscribers, the base renewal rate, including price increases, was 87.3%). During 2016, TTM renewal rates were negatively impacted by: the cancellation of contracts, primarily in the second quarter of 2016, associated with Reis's intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) compliance initiatives; from subscribers that exited the CRE business; and in selected cases, in response to our aggressive repricing on contract expirations. As the Company has worked to improve customer retention, poorer performing quarterly renewal rates have been replaced with higher rates in 2017, resulting in the aforementioned TTM renewal rate improvements. Although there may be quarterly variability, management expects further renewal rate improvement for the annual 2018 period over 2017.\nNew Business - Reis experienced strong levels of new business bookings in 2017. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 continued to be positively impacted by sales that were directly tied to recent product improvements, including wins associated with our expanded sales transaction database with investment sales brokers, property tax appeal firms and tax assessors.\nOther Revenue\nThe Company's other revenue includes: (1) non-subscription revenue custom data deliverables; and (2) one-time settlements. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 2.9% and 4.5%, respectively, of total revenue was generated from one-time settlements (in 2017 and 2016), and custom data deliverables (in 2016 only). A description of the revenue from Intellectual Property settlements and custom data deliverables follows.\nIntellectual Property Settlements - Reis continues to successfully resolve cases in which our intellectual property rights have been violated. In 2016 and 2017, the Company continued to be very active in protecting its intellectual property by pursuing firms and individuals who had previously gained unauthorized access to our services. The discovery of instances of unauthorized usage creates opportunities for Reis's compliance team to engage in productive conversations with firms regarding ongoing access to Reis data in accordance with the terms and conditions of a subscription agreement. Reis has developed a programmatic approach to promptly resolving cases of unauthorized usage and has devoted significant client services and account management resources to increase the renewal rates of IP infringement related accounts to levels typical of all other Reis subscribers. As a result of these compliance procedures, the Company has been able to generate revenue through either one-time settlement payments or by signing up the non-complying firm or individual to an annual or multi-year Reis SE subscription.\nRevenue from one-time settlement payments aggregated $1,388,000 and $931,000 in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Throughout 2017, as our compliance team continued to identify instances of unauthorized access, the period of unauthorized usage being identified was much shorter and report consumption was not as significant as cases that were settled in prior years. Management believes that compliance resolutions will yield a continuing and significant volume of subscription contracts and recurring revenue for the foreseeable future.\nCustom Data Deliverables - The Company recognized significant revenue in 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016 from custom data deliverables and related services for one of our existing Reis SE subscribers. The revenue recorded reflected the portion of the custom\ndata files that was delivered in June and December 2015 and February 2016, positively impacting results for the second and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Revenue related to these deliverables aggregated $1,200,000 in 2016 (all in the first quarter) and $4,519,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn 2016, Reis did not replicate similar custom data sales. Custom data sales generally, and the large 2015 contract specifically, created a higher level of volatility in our 2015 and 2016 revenue and earnings. In 2017, management was able to identify other opportunities to sell custom data files, but structured these sales as subscription agreements with periodic quarterly updates in order to record revenue ratably, consistent with how the Company recognizes revenue for Reis SE.\nDeferred Revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract\nTwo balance-sheet based metrics management utilizes are deferred revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract. Analyzing these amounts can provide additional insight into the Company's future financial performance. Deferred revenue, which is a GAAP basis accounting concept and is reported by the Company on the consolidated balance sheet, represents revenue from annual or longer term contracts for which we have billed and/or received payments from our subscribers related to services we will be providing over the remaining contract period. Aggregate Revenue Under Contract is the sum of deferred revenue and future revenue under non-cancellable contracts for which we do not yet have the contractual right to bill and excludes any future revenues expected to be derived from subscribers currently being billed on a monthly basis.\nDeferred revenue will be recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining life of a contract for subscriptions, or in the case of future custom reports or projects, will be recognized as revenue upon completion and delivery to the customer, provided no significant Company obligations remain. At any given date, both deferred revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract can be either positively or negatively influenced by: (1) the timing and dollar value of contracts signed and billed; (2) the quantity and timing of contracts that are multi-year; and (3) the impact of recording revenue ratably over the life of a multi-year contract, which moderates the effect of price increases after the first year. The following table reconciles deferred revenue to Aggregate Revenue Under Contract at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\n (A) Amounts are billable subsequent to December 31 of each year and represent (i) non-cancellable contracts for subscribers with multi-year subscriptions where the future years are not yet billable, or (ii) subscribers with non-cancellable annual subscriptions with interim billing terms.  Included in Aggregate Revenue Under Contract at December 31, 2017 was approximately $35,878,000 related to amounts under contract for the forward twelve-month period through December 31, 2018. The remainder reflects amounts under contract beyond December 31, 2018. The forward twelve-month Aggregate Revenue Under Contract amount is approximately 74.5% of total revenue on a TTM basis at December 31, 2017. For comparison purposes, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, the forward twelve-month Aggregate Revenue Under Contract was $34,778,000 and $33,822,000, respectively, and as a percentage of that year's total revenue was approximately 73.2% and 66.5%, respectively.\nMulti-Year Contracts and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract - In order to increase the predictability of fees from our subscribers and Reis's revenue and cash flow, we have made a concerted effort to encourage multi-year contracts when appropriate, with terms of two or three years, and in some cases, four years. Over the past three years we have grown the percentage of revenue that is under multi-year contracts from approximately 33% at December 31, 2015 to 38% at December 31, 2016 and up to approximately 45% at December 31, 2017. The average life of multi-year contracts signed in each of the last four years was approximately 2.2 years. There are significant benefits, on a selective basis, of multi-year contracts, including locking in recurring subscription revenue for longer periods, thereby improving our renewal rates and increasing the predictability of future revenues. Multi-year contracts can also positively influence deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract, particularly as the number of multi-year contracts grows year-over-year. Operationally, multi-year contracts free up account management resources to focus on subscribers requiring a higher level of attention and upselling opportunities across our account base. Finally, multi-year deals also insulate us from competitive pressures and increase the likeliness that Reis data and analytics will become embedded in the work flow of our clients.\nIn accordance with GAAP, our revenue recognition policy is to record revenue ratably over the life of a subscriber contract. Therefore any increases in the price of the subscription after the first year of a multi-year contract are considered in the total amount being straight-\nlined over the contract term. If a multi-year contract includes pricing steps on and after the first anniversary, there will be increasing cash flow from the contract, but no growth in revenue during the subsequent years under that contract. There has been resulting variability in our growth rates from having such a significant segment of our subscriber base under multi-year agreements which negatively impacted 2016 performance and muted 2017 growth rates.\n2016 Revenue Performance\nAnnual 2016 financial results for Reis presented a difficult comparison against the substantial revenue and financial growth of 2015. Reis's performance in 2016 relative to the results for 2015 was impacted by four main factors: (1) revenues associated with significant custom data deliverables in 2015; (2) a decline in the TTM renewal rates; (3) a reduction in revenue from IP compliance initiatives; and (4) multi-year contracts and their flattening effect on growth rates.\nSubscription Revenue\nTotal revenue decreased by approximately $(3,360,000), or (6.6)%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable 2015 period; however, subscription revenue in 2016 grew 3.8% over the 2015 annual period.\nRenewal Rates - For the TTM ended December 31, 2016, the Company's base renewal rate, including price increases, was 85.7% (for institutional subscribers, the base renewal rate, including price increases, was 87.3%). For the TTM ended December 31, 2015, the Company's base renewal rate, including price increases, was 91.9% (for institutional subscribers, the base renewal rate, including price increases, was 93.9%). Reis's 2016 TTM renewal rates were negatively impacted by the cancellation of contracts (most significantly in the second quarter of 2016) signed in 2014 and 2015 associated with Reis's IP compliance initiatives, from customer losses from subscribers that exited the CRE business and from aggressive repricing on contract expirations.\nMulti-Year Contracts - As stated above, we have been increasing the amount of revenue that is under multi-year contracts over each of the last three years. There has been resulting variability in our growth rates from having such a significant segment of our subscriber base under multi-year agreements which negatively impacted 2016 performance.\nOther Revenue\nThe Company's other revenue included: (1) non-subscription custom data deliverables; and (2) one-time settlements. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 4.5%, and 14.1%, respectively, of total revenue was generated from custom data deliverables and one-time settlements. A description of the revenue from custom data deliverables and Intellectual Property settlements follows.\nCustom Data Deliverables - As noted above, the Company recognized significant revenue in 2015 from custom data deliverables and related services for one of our existing Reis SE subscribers. The revenue recorded reflected the portion of the custom data files that was delivered in June and December 2015 and February 2016, positively impacting results for the second and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Revenue related to these deliverables aggregated $1,200,000 in 2016 (all in the first quarter) and $4,519,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIntellectual Property Settlements - Revenue from one-time settlement payments aggregated $931,000 and $2,649,000 in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although identified instances of non-compliance remained steady, the frequency and dollar amount of one-time settlements were lower in 2016 than in 2015.\n2017 Earnings Metrics - Net (Loss) Income, Income before Income Taxes, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Reis Services EBITDA\nThe Company had a net (loss) of $(4,548,000) and $(230,000) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had a net (loss) of $(3,158,000) and net income of $2,781,000, respectively. The decrease of $4,318,000 and $5,939,000 in the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to an incremental income tax expense recorded at December 31, 2017 of $5,142,000 from the change in the Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and the resulting reduction to the Company's deferred tax assets to reflect the rate change (as required by the Tax Act). See additional information about revenue and expense variances in this Item 7 and for additional information on taxes, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements include elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company reported income before income taxes of $1,038,000 and a (loss) before income taxes of $(141,000) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in income before income taxes of $1,179,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 over the 2016 comparable period is primarily a result of the revenue increase of $709,000 (as described above), as well as operating expense decreases from quarter to quarter of $765,000 (described below), offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense of\n$254,000, increased stock-based compensation of $36,000 and an increase in net interest expense of $5,000. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had income before income taxes of $2,433,000 and $4,734,000, respectively. The decrease of $(2,301,000) in the annual 2017 period from the 2016 annual period is primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1,426,000 (associated with increased amortization from database and website development in 2017, as well as a full year's worth of depreciation expense in 2017 from the leasehold improvements and other office assets associated with the new operations and corporate headquarters spaces in 2016), an increase in operating expenses of $1,382,000 (primarily from employment related cost increases), an increase in stock-based compensation of $112,000 and an increase in net interest expense of $41,000, offset by the $660,000 increase in revenue (as described above).\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $3,784,000, an increase of $1,474,000, or 63.8%, from the fourth quarter 2016 amount. The increase is a result of the quarterly revenue increase of $709,000 (as described above), as well as expense decreases from the 2016 period of $765,000. The expense reduction from the 2016 fourth quarter to 2017 is a result of a decrease in headcount and other cost efficiencies. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $12,827,000, a decrease of $(722,000), or (5.3)%, from the comparable 2016 annual period. The decrease in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects increased operating expenses of $1,382,000, offset by the annual revenue growth of $660,000 (as described above). Operating expense increases in the annual 2017 period are a result of employment related cost increases over the 2016 period. The consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.9% and 26.6% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as compared to the reported consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.0% and 28.5% for the comparable 2016 periods.\nReis Services EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $4,328,000, an increase of $1,663,000, or 62.4%, from the fourth quarter 2016 amount. The increase is a result of the quarterly revenue increase of $709,000, as well as expense decreases from the 2016 fourth quarter of $954,000. The expense reduction from the 2016 fourth quarter to 2017 is a result of a decrease in headcount and other cost efficiencies. Reis Services EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $15,134,000, a decrease of $(403,000), or (2.6)% from the comparable 2016 annual period. The decrease in Reis Services EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects increased operating expenses of $1,063,000, offset by the annual revenue growth of $660,000. Operating expense increases in the annual 2017 period are a result of employment related cost increases over the 2016 period. Reis Services EBITDA margins were 35.3% and 31.4% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as compared to the reported Reis Services EBITDA margins of 23.1% and 32.7% for the 2016 comparable periods.\nEarnings Metrics - Net Income, Income before Income Taxes and Discontinued Operations, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Reis Services EBITDA\nNet income was $2,781,000 and $10,305,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $(7,524,000) in the year ended December 31, 2016 is a result of the $3,360,000 revenue decline from period to period and operating expense increases described below of $2,572,000, but also includes the impact of increased depreciation and amortization expense in the year ended December 31, 2016 over 2015 of $1,052,000 from increased amortizable website and database intangible assets and increased spending on furniture, fixtures and equipment. In addition, this includes the impact of increased stock-based compensation of $326,000 and an increase in net interest expense of $32,000, as well as a reduction in income from discontinued operations of $2,234,000 as a result of the finalization of activities from discontinued operations in the 2015 period. This is offset by a reduction in income tax expense (from lower taxable income in the 2016 periods) of $(2,052,000) in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding 2015 period.\nIncome before income taxes and discontinued operations was $4,734,000 and $12,076,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $(7,342,000) in the year ended December 31, 2016 is a result of the $3,360,000 revenue decline from period to period and operating expense increases described below of $2,572,000, but also includes the impact of increased depreciation and amortization expense in the year ended December 31, 2016 over 2015 of $1,052,000 from increased amortizable website and database intangible assets and increased spending on furniture, fixtures and equipment, as compared to the corresponding 2015 period. In addition, this includes the impact of increased stock-based compensation of $326,000 and an increase in net interest expense of $32,000.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $13,549,000, a decrease of $(5,932,000), or (30.5)%, from the comparable 2015 period. The decrease primarily resulted from the decline in total revenue of $3,360,000 as described above and the impact of total operating expenses, which grew by $2,572,000 from the comparable 2015 annual period. The consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margins were 28.5% and 38.3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nReis Services EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $15,537,000, a decrease of $(6,537,000), or (29.6)%, from the comparable 2015 period. This decrease primarily resulted from the decline in total revenue of $3,360,000 as described above. Total operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses) grew by $3,177,000, or 11.0%, in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016. Expense increases are primarily due to increased employment related costs and rent related expenses. In particular, total rent expense increased $1,682,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016, over the corresponding 2015 annual period. This amount reflects the increase in both the square footage being leased and the higher price per square foot, and includes the effect of overlapping leases from the duplication of rent and other occupancy costs (aggregating approximately $721,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016). In addition, the Company incurred $118,000 of move related costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, which, with the effect of the duplication of rent, has contributed to the reduction in our EBITDA and EBITDA margins in those periods.\nThe Reis Services EBITDA margin was 32.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 43.4% for the 2015 period. The margin in the year ended December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by the custom data deliverables and other revenue items described previously which had higher margins than our historic sales of Reis SE subscriptions. The 2016 margins were lower than historic norms as a result of the combination of increased expenses and lower total revenue as discussed herein.\nReconciliations of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as earnings (net income (loss)) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation. Although EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, senior management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure operational and management performance. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate supplemental financial measures to be considered in addition to the reported GAAP basis financial information, which may assist investors in evaluating and understanding: (1) the performance of the Reis Services segment, the primary business of the Company and (2) the Company's continuing consolidated results, from year to year or period to period, as applicable. Further, these measures provide the reader with the ability to understand our operational performance while isolating non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as other non-operating items, such as interest income, interest expense and income taxes and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, isolates non-cash charges for stock-based compensation. Management also believes that disclosing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide better comparability to other companies in the information services sector. However, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented both for the Reis Services segment and on a consolidated basis. We believe that these metrics, for Reis Services, provide the reader with valuable information for evaluating the financial performance of the core Reis Services business, excluding public company costs, and for making assessments about the intrinsic value of that stand-alone business to a potential acquirer. Management primarily monitors and measures its performance, and is compensated, based on the results of the Reis Services segment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, on a consolidated basis, allow the reader to make assessments about the current trading value of the Company's common stock, including expenses related to operating as a public company. However, investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for net income (loss), income from continuing operations, operating income, or any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, income from continuing operations, follow for each identified period on a segment basis (including the Reis Services segment), as well as on a consolidated basis:\n\n See footnotes on next page. \n\n (A) Includes interest and other income, depreciation expense and general and administrative expenses (including public company related costs) that are not associated with the Reis Services segment. \nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nTotal revenue and related cost of sales were approximately $48,190,000 and $12,565,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, which resulted in a gross profit for the Reis Services segment of approximately $35,625,000. Amortization expense included in cost of sales (for the database intangible asset) was approximately $3,731,000 during this period. Total revenue and related cost of sales were approximately $47,530,000 and $10,999,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, which resulted in a gross profit for the Reis", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nManagement Summary\nOver the course of the year, the Company recorded incremental quarterly improvements in key financial metrics. Reis started the year with a first quarter decline in revenue and ended with positive revenue growth for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. Revenue declined in the first quarter of 2017 by (5.4)%; improved in the second quarter of 2017 by 0.8%; accelerated by 4.8% in the third quarter of 2017; and grew by 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to each respective 2016 quarter. These improving trends also occurred over the course of 2017 in income before taxes, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Reis Services EBITDA. These advances resulted from improving renewal rates (the overall renewal rate improved to 88.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017) and revenue from new business. All of these metrics will be discussed in greater detail in this section.\nDuring 2017, the Company also made significant product and data enhancements. Reis's database and analytical tools have historically covered the nine key property types most important to real estate professionals focused on the U.S. CRE market (apartment, office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage, seniors housing, student housing and affordable housing), providing up to 38 years of trend analysis and market forecasts for up to 275 metropolitan markets and thousands of submarkets. With the completion of a multi-year initiative to expand upon this cornerstone asset, Reis now offers market information, transaction data and building insights for all commercial properties throughout the nation, regardless of location, size, or use type. The achievement of \u201cEvery Property, Everywhere\u201d positions Reis to serve all CRE professionals and use-cases both within and beyond the Company's traditional property types and coverage boundaries. In parallel with the development of \u201cEvery Property, Everywhere,\u201d the Company has also built a new API, a delivery system that embeds Reis's data (legacy and newly launched) into any client's and prospect's internal system, regardless of platform.\nThe completion of this expansion of coverage in February 2018 affords Reis the opportunity to sell to new user groups within current client firms, and to accelerate sales among tens of thousands of prospect firms, including from investment sales brokerages, tax assessors, tax appeal professionals, and other commercial real estate professionals involved in transactions, asset and portfolio management. This achievement was only possible through the measured step up in investments in our database in recent years.\nCritical Business Metrics\nManagement considers certain metrics in evaluating its consolidated results and the performance of the Reis Services segment. These metrics are revenue, revenue growth, EBITDA (which is earnings (net income (loss)) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), EBITDA growth, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA (which is net income (loss) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation), Adjusted EBITDA growth and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Other important metrics that management considers include cash flow generation as well as the visibility into future performance as supported by our deferred revenue and other related metrics discussed in this Item 7.\nFollowing is a presentation of revenue, net income (loss), income before income taxes and discontinued operations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and the related margins on a consolidated basis and revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the Reis Services segment (see below for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for both the Reis Services segment and on a consolidated basis for each of the periods presented here).\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Revenue\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, total revenue increased by approximately $709,000, or 6.1% over the fourth quarter of 2016. Total revenue increased by approximately $660,000 or 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the comparable 2016 annual period. Subscription revenue increased 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the 2016 period. The two factors that have led to our subscription revenue growth for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, and our improving growth trajectory over the course of 2017, include: (1) improvement in our trailing twelve-month (\u201cTTM\u201d) renewal rates; and (2) new business.\nRenewal Rates - The Company's December 31, 2017 TTM base renewal rate, including price increases, was 88.3% (for institutional subscribers, the base renewal rate, including price increases, was 89.7%). For the TTM ended December 31, 2016, the Company's base renewal rate, including price increases, was 85.7% (for institutional subscribers, the base renewal rate, including price increases, was 87.3%). During 2016, TTM renewal rates were negatively impacted by: the cancellation of contracts, primarily in the second quarter of 2016, associated with Reis's intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) compliance initiatives; from subscribers that exited the CRE business; and in selected cases, in response to our aggressive repricing on contract expirations. As the Company has worked to improve customer retention, poorer performing quarterly renewal rates have been replaced with higher rates in 2017, resulting in the aforementioned TTM renewal rate improvements. Although there may be quarterly variability, management expects further renewal rate improvement for the annual 2018 period over 2017.\nNew Business - Reis experienced strong levels of new business bookings in 2017. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 continued to be positively impacted by sales that were directly tied to recent product improvements, including wins associated with our expanded sales transaction database with investment sales brokers, property tax appeal firms and tax assessors.\nOther Revenue\nThe Company's other revenue includes: (1) non-subscription revenue custom data deliverables; and (2) one-time settlements. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 2.9% and 4.5%, respectively, of total revenue was generated from one-time settlements (in 2017 and 2016), and custom data deliverables (in 2016 only). A description of the revenue from Intellectual Property settlements and custom data deliverables follows.\nIntellectual Property Settlements - Reis continues to successfully resolve cases in which our intellectual property rights have been violated. In 2016 and 2017, the Company continued to be very active in protecting its intellectual property by pursuing firms and individuals who had previously gained unauthorized access to our services. The discovery of instances of unauthorized usage creates opportunities for Reis's compliance team to engage in productive conversations with firms regarding ongoing access to Reis data in accordance with the terms and conditions of a subscription agreement. Reis has developed a programmatic approach to promptly resolving cases of unauthorized usage and has devoted significant client services and account management resources to increase the renewal rates of IP infringement related accounts to levels typical of all other Reis subscribers. As a result of these compliance procedures, the Company has been able to generate revenue through either one-time settlement payments or by signing up the non-complying firm or individual to an annual or multi-year Reis SE subscription.\nRevenue from one-time settlement payments aggregated $1,388,000 and $931,000 in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Throughout 2017, as our compliance team continued to identify instances of unauthorized access, the period of unauthorized usage being identified was much shorter and report consumption was not as significant as cases that were settled in prior years. Management believes that compliance resolutions will yield a continuing and significant volume of subscription contracts and recurring revenue for the foreseeable future.\nCustom Data Deliverables - The Company recognized significant revenue in 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016 from custom data deliverables and related services for one of our existing Reis SE subscribers. The revenue recorded reflected the portion of the custom\ndata files that was delivered in June and December 2015 and February 2016, positively impacting results for the second and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Revenue related to these deliverables aggregated $1,200,000 in 2016 (all in the first quarter) and $4,519,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn 2016, Reis did not replicate similar custom data sales. Custom data sales generally, and the large 2015 contract specifically, created a higher level of volatility in our 2015 and 2016 revenue and earnings. In 2017, management was able to identify other opportunities to sell custom data files, but structured these sales as subscription agreements with periodic quarterly updates in order to record revenue ratably, consistent with how the Company recognizes revenue for Reis SE.\nDeferred Revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract\nTwo balance-sheet based metrics management utilizes are deferred revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract. Analyzing these amounts can provide additional insight into the Company's future financial performance. Deferred revenue, which is a GAAP basis accounting concept and is reported by the Company on the consolidated balance sheet, represents revenue from annual or longer term contracts for which we have billed and/or received payments from our subscribers related to services we will be providing over the remaining contract period. Aggregate Revenue Under Contract is the sum of deferred revenue and future revenue under non-cancellable contracts for which we do not yet have the contractual right to bill and excludes any future revenues expected to be derived from subscribers currently being billed on a monthly basis.\nDeferred revenue will be recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining life of a contract for subscriptions, or in the case of future custom reports or projects, will be recognized as revenue upon completion and delivery to the customer, provided no significant Company obligations remain. At any given date, both deferred revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract can be either positively or negatively influenced by: (1) the timing and dollar value of contracts signed and billed; (2) the quantity and timing of contracts that are multi-year; and (3) the impact of recording revenue ratably over the life of a multi-year contract, which moderates the effect of price increases after the first year. The following table reconciles deferred revenue to Aggregate Revenue Under Contract at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred revenue (GAAP basis)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 26,534,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 25,031,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amounts under non-cancellable contracts for which the Company does not yet have the contractual right to bill at the period end (A)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,470,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,928,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aggregate Revenue Under Contract\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,004,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,959,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) Amounts are billable subsequent to December 31 of each year and represent (i) non-cancellable contracts for subscribers with multi-year subscriptions where the future years are not yet billable, or (ii) subscribers with non-cancellable annual subscriptions with interim billing terms.  Included in Aggregate Revenue Under Contract at December 31, 2017 was approximately $35,878,000 related to amounts under contract for the forward twelve-month period through December 31, 2018. The remainder reflects amounts under contract beyond December 31, 2018. The forward twelve-month Aggregate Revenue Under Contract amount is approximately 74.5% of total revenue on a TTM basis at December 31, 2017. For comparison purposes, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, the forward twelve-month Aggregate Revenue Under Contract was $34,778,000 and $33,822,000, respectively, and as a percentage of that year's total revenue was approximately 73.2% and 66.5%, respectively.\nMulti-Year Contracts and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract - In order to increase the predictability of fees from our subscribers and Reis's revenue and cash flow, we have made a concerted effort to encourage multi-year contracts when appropriate, with terms of two or three years, and in some cases, four years. Over the past three years we have grown the percentage of revenue that is under multi-year contracts from approximately 33% at December 31, 2015 to 38% at December 31, 2016 and up to approximately 45% at December 31, 2017. The average life of multi-year contracts signed in each of the last four years was approximately 2.2 years. There are significant benefits, on a selective basis, of multi-year contracts, including locking in recurring subscription revenue for longer periods, thereby improving our renewal rates and increasing the predictability of future revenues. Multi-year contracts can also positively influence deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract, particularly as the number of multi-year contracts grows year-over-year. Operationally, multi-year contracts free up account management resources to focus on subscribers requiring a higher level of attention and upselling opportunities across our account base. Finally, multi-year deals also insulate us from competitive pressures and increase the likeliness that Reis data and analytics will become embedded in the work flow of our clients.\nIn accordance with GAAP, our revenue recognition policy is to record revenue ratably over the life of a subscriber contract. Therefore any increases in the price of the subscription after the first year of a multi-year contract are considered in the total amount being straight-\nlined over the contract term. If a multi-year contract includes pricing steps on and after the first anniversary, there will be increasing cash flow from the contract, but no growth in revenue during the subsequent years under that contract. There has been resulting variability in our growth rates from having such a significant segment of our subscriber base under multi-year agreements which negatively impacted 2016 performance and muted 2017 growth rates.\n2016 Revenue Performance\nAnnual 2016 financial results for Reis presented a difficult comparison against the substantial revenue and financial growth of 2015. Reis's performance in 2016 relative to the results for 2015 was impacted by four main factors: (1) revenues associated with significant custom data deliverables in 2015; (2) a decline in the TTM renewal rates; (3) a reduction in revenue from IP compliance initiatives; and (4) multi-year contracts and their flattening effect on growth rates.\nSubscription Revenue\nTotal revenue decreased by approximately $(3,360,000), or (6.6)%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable 2015 period; however, subscription revenue in 2016 grew 3.8% over the 2015 annual period.\nRenewal Rates - For the TTM ended December 31, 2016, the Company's base renewal rate, including price increases, was 85.7% (for institutional subscribers, the base renewal rate, including price increases, was 87.3%). For the TTM ended December 31, 2015, the Company's base renewal rate, including price increases, was 91.9% (for institutional subscribers, the base renewal rate, including price increases, was 93.9%). Reis's 2016 TTM renewal rates were negatively impacted by the cancellation of contracts (most significantly in the second quarter of 2016) signed in 2014 and 2015 associated with Reis's IP compliance initiatives, from customer losses from subscribers that exited the CRE business and from aggressive repricing on contract expirations.\nMulti-Year Contracts - As stated above, we have been increasing the amount of revenue that is under multi-year contracts over each of the last three years. There has been resulting variability in our growth rates from having such a significant segment of our subscriber base under multi-year agreements which negatively impacted 2016 performance.\nOther Revenue\nThe Company's other revenue included: (1) non-subscription custom data deliverables; and (2) one-time settlements. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 4.5%, and 14.1%, respectively, of total revenue was generated from custom data deliverables and one-time settlements. A description of the revenue from custom data deliverables and Intellectual Property settlements follows.\nCustom Data Deliverables - As noted above, the Company recognized significant revenue in 2015 from custom data deliverables and related services for one of our existing Reis SE subscribers. The revenue recorded reflected the portion of the custom data files that was delivered in June and December 2015 and February 2016, positively impacting results for the second and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Revenue related to these deliverables aggregated $1,200,000 in 2016 (all in the first quarter) and $4,519,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIntellectual Property Settlements - Revenue from one-time settlement payments aggregated $931,000 and $2,649,000 in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although identified instances of non-compliance remained steady, the frequency and dollar amount of one-time settlements were lower in 2016 than in 2015.\n2017 Earnings Metrics - Net (Loss) Income, Income before Income Taxes, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Reis Services EBITDA\nThe Company had a net (loss) of $(4,548,000) and $(230,000) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had a net (loss) of $(3,158,000) and net income of $2,781,000, respectively. The decrease of $4,318,000 and $5,939,000 in the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to an incremental income tax expense recorded at December 31, 2017 of $5,142,000 from the change in the Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and the resulting reduction to the Company's deferred tax assets to reflect the rate change (as required by the Tax Act). See additional information about revenue and expense variances in this Item 7 and for additional information on taxes, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements include elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company reported income before income taxes of $1,038,000 and a (loss) before income taxes of $(141,000) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in income before income taxes of $1,179,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 over the 2016 comparable period is primarily a result of the revenue increase of $709,000 (as described above), as well as operating expense decreases from quarter to quarter of $765,000 (described below), offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense of\n$254,000, increased stock-based compensation of $36,000 and an increase in net interest expense of $5,000. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had income before income taxes of $2,433,000 and $4,734,000, respectively. The decrease of $(2,301,000) in the annual 2017 period from the 2016 annual period is primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1,426,000 (associated with increased amortization from database and website development in 2017, as well as a full year's worth of depreciation expense in 2017 from the leasehold improvements and other office assets associated with the new operations and corporate headquarters spaces in 2016), an increase in operating expenses of $1,382,000 (primarily from employment related cost increases), an increase in stock-based compensation of $112,000 and an increase in net interest expense of $41,000, offset by the $660,000 increase in revenue (as described above).\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $3,784,000, an increase of $1,474,000, or 63.8%, from the fourth quarter 2016 amount. The increase is a result of the quarterly revenue increase of $709,000 (as described above), as well as expense decreases from the 2016 period of $765,000. The expense reduction from the 2016 fourth quarter to 2017 is a result of a decrease in headcount and other cost efficiencies. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $12,827,000, a decrease of $(722,000), or (5.3)%, from the comparable 2016 annual period. The decrease in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects increased operating expenses of $1,382,000, offset by the annual revenue growth of $660,000 (as described above). Operating expense increases in the annual 2017 period are a result of employment related cost increases over the 2016 period. The consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.9% and 26.6% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as compared to the reported consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.0% and 28.5% for the comparable 2016 periods.\nReis Services EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $4,328,000, an increase of $1,663,000, or 62.4%, from the fourth quarter 2016 amount. The increase is a result of the quarterly revenue increase of $709,000, as well as expense decreases from the 2016 fourth quarter of $954,000. The expense reduction from the 2016 fourth quarter to 2017 is a result of a decrease in headcount and other cost efficiencies. Reis Services EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $15,134,000, a decrease of $(403,000), or (2.6)% from the comparable 2016 annual period. The decrease in Reis Services EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects increased operating expenses of $1,063,000, offset by the annual revenue growth of $660,000. Operating expense increases in the annual 2017 period are a result of employment related cost increases over the 2016 period. Reis Services EBITDA margins were 35.3% and 31.4% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as compared to the reported Reis Services EBITDA margins of 23.1% and 32.7% for the 2016 comparable periods.\nEarnings Metrics - Net Income, Income before Income Taxes and Discontinued Operations, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Reis Services EBITDA\nNet income was $2,781,000 and $10,305,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $(7,524,000) in the year ended December 31, 2016 is a result of the $3,360,000 revenue decline from period to period and operating expense increases described below of $2,572,000, but also includes the impact of increased depreciation and amortization expense in the year ended December 31, 2016 over 2015 of $1,052,000 from increased amortizable website and database intangible assets and increased spending on furniture, fixtures and equipment. In addition, this includes the impact of increased stock-based compensation of $326,000 and an increase in net interest expense of $32,000, as well as a reduction in income from discontinued operations of $2,234,000 as a result of the finalization of activities from discontinued operations in the 2015 period. This is offset by a reduction in income tax expense (from lower taxable income in the 2016 periods) of $(2,052,000) in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding 2015 period.\nIncome before income taxes and discontinued operations was $4,734,000 and $12,076,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $(7,342,000) in the year ended December 31, 2016 is a result of the $3,360,000 revenue decline from period to period and operating expense increases described below of $2,572,000, but also includes the impact of increased depreciation and amortization expense in the year ended December 31, 2016 over 2015 of $1,052,000 from increased amortizable website and database intangible assets and increased spending on furniture, fixtures and equipment, as compared to the corresponding 2015 period. In addition, this includes the impact of increased stock-based compensation of $326,000 and an increase in net interest expense of $32,000.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $13,549,000, a decrease of $(5,932,000), or (30.5)%, from the comparable 2015 period. The decrease primarily resulted from the decline in total revenue of $3,360,000 as described above and the impact of total operating expenses, which grew by $2,572,000 from the comparable 2015 annual period. The consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margins were 28.5% and 38.3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nReis Services EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $15,537,000, a decrease of $(6,537,000), or (29.6)%, from the comparable 2015 period. This decrease primarily resulted from the decline in total revenue of $3,360,000 as described above. Total operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses) grew by $3,177,000, or 11.0%, in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016. Expense increases are primarily due to increased employment related costs and rent related expenses. In particular, total rent expense increased $1,682,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016, over the corresponding 2015 annual period. This amount reflects the increase in both the square footage being leased and the higher price per square foot, and includes the effect of overlapping leases from the duplication of rent and other occupancy costs (aggregating approximately $721,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016). In addition, the Company incurred $118,000 of move related costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, which, with the effect of the duplication of rent, has contributed to the reduction in our EBITDA and EBITDA margins in those periods.\nThe Reis Services EBITDA margin was 32.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 43.4% for the 2015 period. The margin in the year ended December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by the custom data deliverables and other revenue items described previously which had higher margins than our historic sales of Reis SE subscriptions. The 2016 margins were lower than historic norms as a result of the combination of increased expenses and lower total revenue as discussed herein.\nReconciliations of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as earnings (net income (loss)) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation. Although EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, senior management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure operational and management performance. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate supplemental financial measures to be considered in addition to the reported GAAP basis financial information, which may assist investors in evaluating and understanding: (1) the performance of the Reis Services segment, the primary business of the Company and (2) the Company's continuing consolidated results, from year to year or period to period, as applicable. Further, these measures provide the reader with the ability to understand our operational performance while isolating non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as other non-operating items, such as interest income, interest expense and income taxes and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, isolates non-cash charges for stock-based compensation. Management also believes that disclosing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide better comparability to other companies in the information services sector. However, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented both for the Reis Services segment and on a consolidated basis. We believe that these metrics, for Reis Services, provide the reader with valuable information for evaluating the financial performance of the core Reis Services business, excluding public company costs, and for making assessments about the intrinsic value of that stand-alone business to a potential acquirer. Management primarily monitors and measures its performance, and is compensated, based on the results of the Reis Services segment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, on a consolidated basis, allow the reader to make assessments about the current trading value of the Company's common stock, including expenses related to operating as a public company. However, investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for net income (loss), income from continuing operations, operating income, or any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, income from continuing operations, follow for each identified period on a segment basis (including the Reis Services segment), as well as on a consolidated basis:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
