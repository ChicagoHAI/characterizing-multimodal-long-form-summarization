Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to assist a reader in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the periods presented. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the other sections contained herein. References to the Company and the Bank throughout MD&A are made using the first person notations of we\u201d, us\u201d or our\u201d.\n2015 OVERVIEW\nThe Company's net income was $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net income of $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe change in net income for the comparative periods was primarily impacted by:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Pretax net income increased by $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.

The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, include the results of operations of First National and Heritage Bank for the entire year, whereas in 2014 the Company's results of operations included the results of operations for First National and Heritage Bank only for the period from June 14 through December 31, 2014. The results of operations of Metropolitan were included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company beginning October 1, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The provision for income taxes increased $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.

The increases were due both to normal operating expenses and continued integration costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nACQUISITIONS\nMetropolitan National Bank\nOn October 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Metropolitan from Marshfield Investment Company ( Marshfield\u201d). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Metropolitan and Marshfield received proceeds of approximately $70 million, consisting of 4,610,317 shares of Company common stock valued at approximately $42 million and $28 million in cash. The Company paid $10.1 million of the total cash consideration and Metropolitan paid $17.9 million of the total cash consideration in conjunction with the closing of the acquisition. As of December 31, 2015, Metropolitan conducted business from twelve full service locations throughout Southwest Missouri and one loan production office in Joplin, Missouri and had total assets of $455.5 million. On February 19, 2016, Metropolitan was merged with the charter of Bear State Bank, N.A.\nFirst National Security Company\nThe Company completed its merger with FNSC and its accompanying acquisition of FNSC's subsidiaries, including First National and Heritage Bank, on June 13, 2014. On February 13, 2015, First Federal Bank, First National and Heritage Bank were consolidated into a single charter forming Bear State Bank, N.A. The Company has achieved significant operational and organizational improvements as a result of the charter consolidation and technology integration, the benefits of which the Company began to realize in the second quarter of 2015.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn February 19, 2016, the Company converted Metropolitan's systems to the Company's core technology platform, and merged Metropolitan's charter into Bear State Bank. In addition to the Metropolitan integration project, the Company has evaluated its branch network and intends to reduce its total retail branches by up to six. The Company anticipates the integration and branch consolidation project to be substantially completed by the second quarter of 2016.\nOn February 3, 2016, the Company purchased through one broker in an unsolicited single block trade 448,068 shares of its common stock for a cash purchase price of $8.05 per share, or an aggregate purchase price for all of the shares of approximately $3.6 million. The repurchase was specially approved by the board of directors of the Company, including all of its independent directors, and is in addition to, and will not reduce, the remaining capacity under the Company's existing share repurchase program previously announced on March 13, 2015, and as amended on June 19, 2015 (the 2015 Repurchase Program\u201d). As of February 3, 2016, the Company's remaining capacity under the 2015 Repurchase Program was approximately $1.7 million.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nVarious elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. These policies and the judgments, estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of this MD&A and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. In particular, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d generally describes our accounting policies. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of our Consolidated Financial Statements to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition.\nDetermination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d). In estimating the amount of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, various judgments and assumptions are made. For example, when assessing the condition of the overall economic environment, assumptions are made regarding market conditions and their impact on the loan portfolio. In the event the economy were to sustain a prolonged downturn, the loss factors applied to our portfolios may need to be revised, which may significantly impact the measurement of the ALLL. For impaired loans that are collateral dependent and for REO, the estimated fair value of the collateral may deviate significantly from the proceeds received when the collateral is sold.\nAcquired loan amounts deemed uncollectible at acquisition date become part of the fair value calculation and are excluded from the ALLL. Quarterly reviews are completed on acquired loans to determine if changes in estimated cash flows have occurred. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected may result in a provision for loan and lease losses with a corresponding increase in the ALLL. Subsequent increases in the amount expected to be collected result in a reversal of any previously recorded provision for loan and lease losses and the related ALLL, if any, or prospective adjustment to the accretable yield if no provision for loan and lease losses had been recorded.\nAcquired Loans. Acquired loans and leases are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. No allowance for loan and lease losses is recorded on the acquisition date as the fair value of the acquired assets incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. The fair value adjustment on acquired loans without evidence of credit deterioration since origination will be accreted into earnings as a yield adjustment using the level yield method over the remaining life of the loan.\nAcquired loans and leases with evidence of credit deterioration since origination such that it is probable at acquisition that the Bank will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the guidance in ASC Topic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. As of the acquisition date, the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected is the nonaccretable difference, which is included as a reduction of the carrying amount of acquired loans and leases. If the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable, any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the asset's remaining life using a level yield method.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Under acquisition accounting, if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of its net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer's balance sheet as goodwill. An intangible asset is recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if it arises from contractual or other legal rights or if it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. Intangible assets are identifiable assets, such as core deposit intangibles, resulting from acquisitions which are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life and evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that may trigger a decline in the value of the reporting unit or otherwise indicate that a potential impairment exists. Potential impairment of goodwill exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. To the extent the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill will be determined. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and is written down to the implied fair value. The loss recognized is limited to the carrying amount of goodwill. Once an impairment loss is recognized, future increases in fair value will not result in the reversal of previously recognized losses.\nValuation of real estate owned. Fair value is estimated through current appraisals, real estate brokers' opinions or listing prices. As these properties are actively marketed, estimated fair values may be adjusted by management to reflect current economic and market conditions. The estimated fair value of the collateral may deviate significantly from the proceeds received when the collateral is sold.\nValuation of investment securities. The Company has classified all of its investment securities as available for sale. Accordingly, its investment securities are stated at estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements with unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity with any related changes included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company utilizes independent third parties as its principal sources for determining fair value of its investment securities that are measured on a recurring basis. For investment securities traded in an active market, the fair values are based on quoted market prices if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on market prices for comparable securities, broker quotes or comprehensive interest rate tables, pricing matrices or a combination thereof. For investment securities traded in a market that is not active, fair value is determined using unobservable inputs. The fair values of the Company's investment securities traded in both active and inactive markets can be volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors including market interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates, credit quality of the issuer, general market conditions including market liquidity conditions and other factors. Factors and conditions are constantly changing and fair values could be subject to material variations that may significantly impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nValuation of deferred tax assets. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability using a consistent approach that considers the relative impact of negative and positive evidence, including our historical profitability and projections of future taxable income. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management-approved business plans and ongoing tax planning strategies. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between our projected operating performance, our actual results and other factors.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet Interest Income. The Company's results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income for 2015 was $54.5 million compared to $37.4 million in 2014. The increase in net interest income resulted from changes in interest income and interest expense discussed below.\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2015 was $60.8 million compared to $42.5 million in 2014. The increase in interest income in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increases in the average balances of loans receivable and investment securities as a result of the FNSC and Metropolitan acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned on loans receivable.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for 2015 was $6.4 million compared to $5.1 million in 2014. The increase in interest expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in the average balances of deposit accounts and borrowings due to the acquisitions of FNSC and Metropolitan, partially offset by a decrease in the average rate paid on deposits.\nRate/Volume Analysis. The table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the periods indicated. For each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (changes in average volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior average volume); (iii) changes in rate-volume (changes in rate multiplied by the change in average volume); and (iv) the net change.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>

nonaccrual loans.\n(2) Includes FRB and FHLB stock.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses represents the amount added to the ALLL for the purpose of maintaining the ALLL at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of the ALLL is evaluated quarterly by management of the Bank based on the Bank's past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral and other qualitative factors.\nManagement determined that a provision for loan losses of $1.8 million was required for the year ended December 31, 2015, to maintain the ALLL at an adequate level. Management determined the necessity of the provision and the amount thereof taking into consideration (i) loans originated by the Bank during the period, (ii) changes in the overall portfolio of nonperforming and classified loans of the Bank, (iii) the credit quality of the Bank's loan portfolio, (iv) ALLL coverage of classified loans and (v) discount balance of acquired loans. The ALLL as a percentage of loans receivable was 1.0% at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.3% at December 31, 2014. The ALLL plus the discount on acquired loans as a percentage of total loans receivable gross of the acquired loan discount was 2.1% at December 31, 2015, compared to 2.4% at December 31, 2014. The ALLL as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 75.23% at December 31, 2015, compared to 139.8% at December 31, 2014. The ALLL as a percentage of classified loans was 29.22% at December 31, 2015, compared to 38.8% at December 31, 2014. See Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d in the Asset Quality\u201d section. A quarterly review is completed on purchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans to determine if changes in estimated cash flows have occurred. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected may result in a provision for loan and lease losses with a corresponding increase in the ALLL.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income is generated primarily through deposit account fee income, profit on sale of loans, and earnings on life insurance policies. Total noninterest income increased $3.5 million to $13.5 million for 2015 compared to $10.0 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to increases in deposit fee income and earnings on life insurance policies attributable to the acquisitions of FNSC and Metropolitan.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense consists primarily of employee compensation and benefits, data processing expense, office occupancy expense, real estate owned expense, and other operating expense. Total noninterest expense increased $8.9 million to $51.0 million in 2015 compared to $42.1 million in 2014. The variances in certain noninterest expense items are further explained in the following paragraphs, with the aggregate expense increase being primarily related to the increase in employee compensation expense, net occupancy expense and other expenses related to the acquisitions and integration of FNSC and Metropolitan. The Company expects that it will incur additional expenses related to its acquisition and integration of Metropolitan during the first quarter of 2016.\nSalaries and Employee Benefits. Salaries and employee benefits increased $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to an increase in personnel attributable to the acquisitions of FNSC and Metropolitan, offset by a decrease in defined benefit pension expense. The decrease in defined benefit pension expense was primarily due to a non-recurring charge of $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2014 due to the Company's election to retire certain pension liabilities of the Company's multiemployer defined benefit plan.

Minimal additional provisions were needed in 2015 above those previously recorded. REO expenses such as taxes, insurance and maintenance as well as rental income are expected to continue to decline as the size of the REO portfolio decreases. Future levels of loss provisions and net gains or losses on sales of REO will depend on market conditions. The acquisition of FNSC and Metropolitan had no material impact on REO, net.\nAdvertising and Public Relations. The increase in advertising and public relations expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 of $1.2 million was primarily due to expenses related to the acquisition and integration of FNSC, rebranding expenses associated with the name change of the combined bank during the first quarter of 2015, and the acquisition of Metropolitan in the fourth quarter of 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, the charters of First Federal Bank, First National and Heritage Bank were merged into a single bank charter forming Bear State Bank, N.A. The Company expects that it will incur additional expenses related to its acquisition and rebranding associated with the name change of Metropolitan during the first quarter of 2016.\nOther Noninterest Expenses. Other noninterest expense increased $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the acquisition and integration of FNSC and the recent acquisition of Metropolitan. The changes in other noninterest expenses are presented below (in thousands):\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>385 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Postage and supplies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,113 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,621 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes.

Loan concentrations are defined as loans to borrowers engaged in similar business-related activities, which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. We regularly monitor these concentrations in order to consider adjustments in our lending practices. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there was no concentration of loans within any portfolio category to any group of borrowers engaged in similar activities or in a similar business that exceeded 10% of total loans.\nLoan Maturity and Interest Rates. The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 2015, regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the Bank's loan portfolios based on their contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans and loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. All other loans are included in the period in which the final contractual repayment is due.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Within\nOne Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After

The average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their average contractual terms because of loan prepayments.\nASSET QUALITY\nLoans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is 90 days past due or, in the judgment of management, the probability of the full collection of principal and interest is deemed to be sufficiently uncertain to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. Loans may be reinstated to accrual status when payments are made to bring the loan current and, in the opinion of management, full collection of the remaining principal and interest can be reasonably expected. The Bank may continue to accrue interest on certain loans that are 90 days past due or more if such loans are well secured and in the process of collection.\nReal estate properties acquired through foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair value is typically determined based on the lower of a current appraised value or management's estimate of the net realizable value based on the listing price of the property. Valuations of real estate owned are generally performed at least annually.\nNonperforming Assets.

During the third quarter in 2015, there was a development in the borrower's business that led to deterioration in the Bank's future repayment prospects leading the Bank to place the loans on nonaccrual status. The Bank evaluated the collateral securing the loans and recorded an allocation to the ALLL of $336,000 at December 31, 2015. Management is actively working with the borrower to resolve this situation. The increase also included $2.7 million of nonaccrual loans from the Metropolitan acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nReal Estate Owned.

Federal regulations require that each financial institution risk rate their classified assets into three classification categories - substandard, doubtful and loss. Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified loss is generally considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset is not warranted. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bank did not have any assets classified as doubtful or loss.\nThe table below summarizes the Bank's classified assets as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,770 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accruing classified loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,429 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Classified loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,199 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,792 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total classified assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,991 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Texas Ratio (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Classified Assets Ratio (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Defined as the ratio of nonperforming loans and real estate owned to the Bank's Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan and lease losses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Defined as the ratio of classified assets to the Bank's Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan and lease losses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in classified assets during the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to the addition of nonaccrual loans and accruing classified loans from the Metropolitan acquisition. Classified assets in the acquired loan portfolio of Metropolitan totaled approximately $14.6 million at December 31, 2015.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The Bank maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses for known and inherent losses determined by ongoing quarterly assessments of the loan portfolio. The estimated appropriate level of the ALLL is maintained through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Charge-offs are recorded against the ALLL when management believes the estimated loss has been confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ALLL.\nThe ALLL consists of general and allocated (also referred to as specific) loan loss components. For loans that are determined to be impaired that are troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs\u201d) and impaired loans where the relationship totals $250,000 or more, a specific loan loss allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value of the impaired loan is lower than its carrying value. The general loan loss allowance applies to loans that are not impaired and those impaired relationships under $250,000 and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors.\nThe ALLL represents management's estimate of incurred credit losses inherent in the Bank's loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimation of the ALLL is based on a variety of factors, including past loan loss experience, the current credit profile of the Bank's borrowers, adverse situations that have occurred that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay, the estimated value of underlying collateral, and general economic conditions, including unemployment, bankruptcy trends, vacancy rates and the level and trend of home sales and prices. Losses are recognized when available information indicates that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or conditions change.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the short fall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Each quarter, classified loans where the borrower's total loan relationship exceeds $250,000 are evaluated for impairment on a loan-by-loan basis. Nonaccrual loans and TDRs are considered to be impaired loans. TDRs are restructurings in which the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that the Bank would not otherwise consider. Impairment is measured quarterly on a loan-by-loan basis for all TDRs and impaired loans where the aggregate relationship balance exceeds $250,000 by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. Impaired loans under this threshold are aggregated and included in loan pools with their ALLL calculated as described in the following paragraph.\nGroups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Homogeneous loans are those that are considered to have common characteristics that provide for evaluation on an aggregate or pool basis. The Bank considers the characteristics of (1) one- to four-family residential mortgage loans; (2) unsecured consumer loans; and (3) collateralized consumer loans to permit consideration of the appropriateness of the ALLL of each group of loans on a pool basis. The primary methodology used to determine the appropriateness of the ALLL includes segregating impaired loans from the pools of loans, valuing these loans, and then applying a loss factor to the remaining pool balance based on several factors including past loss experience, inherent risks, and economic conditions in the primary market areas.\nAcquired loan amounts deemed uncollectible at acquisition date become part of the fair value calculation and are excluded from the ALLL. Quarterly reviews are completed on acquired loans to determine if changes in estimated cash flows have occurred. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected may result in a provision for loan and lease losses with a corresponding increase in the ALLL. Subsequent increases in the amount expected to be collected result in a reversal of any previously recorded provision for loan and lease losses and related increase in ALLL, if any, or prospective adjustment to the accretable yield if no provision for loan and lease losses had been recorded or if the provision is less than the subsequent increase.\nIn estimating the amount of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, various judgments and assumptions are made. For example, when assessing the condition of the overall economic environment, assumptions are made regarding market conditions and their impact on the loan portfolio. For impaired loans that are collateral dependent, the estimated fair value of the collateral may deviate significantly from the proceeds received when the collateral is sold in the event that the Bank has to foreclose or repossess the collateral.\nThe Company considers the ALLL totaling approximately $14.6 million to be appropriate based on evaluations of the management of the Bank of the loan portfolio and the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015. Actual losses may substantially differ from currently estimated losses. Adequacy of the ALLL is periodically evaluated, and the ALLL could be significantly decreased or increased, which could materially affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table summarizes changes in the ALLL and other selected statistics for the periods indicated.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December

provide and maintain liquidity, to provide collateral for pledging requirements, to complement the Company's interest rate risk strategy and to generate a favorable return. The Company's investment policy, as established by the Board of Directors, is currently implemented within the parameters set by the asset/liability management committee. The Company is authorized to invest in obligations issued or fully guaranteed by the U.S. Government, certain federal agency obligations, certain time deposits, negotiable certificates of deposit issued by commercial banks and other insured financial institutions, municipal securities, corporate debt securities, and other specified investments.\nInvestment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. Investment securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of tax in other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2015, all of the Company's investment securities were classified as available for sale. At December 31, 2015, investment securities with a carrying value of approximately $119.1 million were pledged as collateral for certain deposits in excess of $250,000 and for other purposes, including investment securities with carrying values of approximately $12.1 million and $2.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for securities sold under agreements to repurchase. At December 31, 2015, investments in the debt and/or equity securities of any one issuer did not exceed more than 10% of the Company's stockholders' equity.\nThe following table sets forth the amortized cost (in thousands) of investment securities available for sale that contractually mature during each of the periods indicated and the weighted average yields for each range of maturities at December 31, 2015. Weighted average yields for municipal obligations have not been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay the obligation without prepayment penalties.\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

The offsetting decrease in deposits is due, in part, to management's efforts to reduce unprofitable to marginally profitable Bear State accounts along with seasonal fluctuations in account balances and personal certificates of deposit being withdrawn during the period.\nThe following table presents the average balance of each type of deposit and the average rate paid on each type of deposit and/or total deposits for the periods indicated.\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\nRate\nPaid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\nRate\nPaid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\nRate\nPaid\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Checking accounts - interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>401,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>264,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Checking accounts - noninterest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>189,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>466,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,322,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>921,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>458,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.76 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth maturities of the Bank's certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2015 by time remaining to maturity.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Period Ending:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (In Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,894 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 30, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,852 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,974 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,097 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> After December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135,097 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total certificates of deposit with balances of $100,000 or more\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>254,914 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort Term and Other Borrowings. FHLB advances increased by $10.4 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 due primarily to new advances of $39.8 million partially offset by maturing advances in 2015. Other borrowings also increased by $700,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of draws of $1.9 million on the Company's line of credit with an unaffiliated bank, partially offset by repayments of $1.2 million on the Company's notes payable with an unaffiliated bank.\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to the Company's borrowings at and during the periods indicated.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At or For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum month end balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,615 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year end balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,941 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> At end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.07 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.50 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> During the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.42 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.03 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe primary source of funds for the Company is the receipt of dividends from the Bank, the receipt of management fees from the Bank, cash balances maintained, and borrowings from an unaffiliated source. Payment of dividends by the Bank is subject to certain regulatory restrictions as set forth in banking laws and regulations.\nThe Company's primary uses of cash include injecting capital into subsidiaries, stock repurchases, debt service requirements, and paying for general operating expenses.\nThe Company's objective as it relates to liquidity is to ensure that the Bank has funding and access to sources of funding to ensure that cash flow requirements for deposit withdrawals and credit demands are met in an orderly and timely manner without unduly penalizing profitability. A major component of our overall asset/liability management efforts surrounds pricing of the liability side to ensure adequate liquidity and proper spread and interest margin management. Reliance on any one funding source is kept to a minimum by prioritizing those sources in terms of both availability and time to activation.\nIn order to maintain proper levels of liquidity, the Bank has several sources of funds available. Generally the Bank relies on cash on hand and due from banks, federal funds sold, cash flow generated by the repayment of principal and interest on and/or the sale of loans and securities and deposits as its primary sources of funds for continuing operations, to make loans and leases, and acquire investment securities and other assets. Commercial, consumer and public funds customers in our local markets are the principal deposit sources utilized.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Bank's unused borrowing availability primarily consisted of (1) $229.4 million of available borrowing capacity with the FHLB, (2) $79.3 million of investment securities available to pledge for federal funds or other borrowings and (3) $102.5 million of available unsecured federal funds borrowing lines. In addition, at December 31, 2015, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $9.6 million with an unaffiliated bank.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company's consolidated liquidity ratio was approximately 8.1% which represents liquid assets as a percentage of deposits and short-term borrowings. As of the same date, the Company's overall adjusted liquidity ratio was 22.8%, which represents liquid assets plus borrowing capacity with the FHLB and correspondent banks as a percentage of deposit and short-term borrowings. The Company anticipates it will continue to rely primarily on principal and interest repayments on loans and securities and deposits to provide liquidity, as well as other funding sources as appropriate. Additionally, where appropriate, the secondary sources of borrowed funds described above will be used to augment the Company's primary funding sources. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy the current and projected operations of the Company and the Bank.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company's leverage, common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios were 9.15%, 10.62%, 10.62% and 11.52%, respectively, compared to capital adequacy requirements of 4%, 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Regulatory Matters\u201d for more information about the Company's and the Bank's capital requirements and ratios.\nThe agreement governing the Company's revolving credit facility with an unaffiliated bank contains affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or guarantee indebtedness, incur liens, engage in mergers and acquisitions or other assets, dispose of assets, pay dividends and repurchase or redeem capital stock, make changes in management, and engage in transactions with affiliates. The agreement also contains financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.0 to 1.0, a maximum loan to value ratio of 75%, a maximum classified asset ratio of 50% and Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 8%. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with the applicable covenants imposed by the loan agreement.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS and CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAt December 31, 2015, the Bank was contractually obligated to make future minimum payments as follows (in thousands):\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit maturities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>287,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>513,241 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,047 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015, the Bank was contractually obligated to fund future obligations at maturity as follows (in thousands):\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unused lines of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,940 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unadvanced portion of construction loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,109 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,220 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan origination commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,153 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank's primary off-balance sheet commitments include unused lines of credit, the unadvanced portion of construction loans, and commercial and standby letters of credit, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. These commitments are not required to be recorded on the Company's balance sheet. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and lending and financing arrangements may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements- Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commitments\u201d for further discussion on these arrangements.\nDIVIDENDS\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, an 11% stock dividend was distributed by the Company. No dividends were distributed during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company may not declare or pay cash dividends on its shares of common stock if the effect thereof would cause the Company's stockholders' equity to be reduced below applicable regulatory capital maintenance requirements for insured institutions. In addition, federal regulations, as currently applied to the Bank, impose limitations upon payment of capital distributions to the Company. No dividends were available for distribution at December 31, 2015, without prior regulatory approval.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nThe financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation.\nUnlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the Company's assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than does the effect of inflation.\nImpact of new accounting standards\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d", "summary": "- The provided table represents the total number of students enrolled in each grade for a specific school during a particular year.\n- The table contains information about the enrollment numbers for grades K-12.\n- Overall, the table indicates that the highest number of students was enrolled in grade 12, with 1,684 students, while the lowest number of students was in grade K, with 611 students.\n- Besides, the total number of students in grades 9-12 is higher than that in grades K-8.\n- Specifically, the table shows that the number of students in grade 12 is almost three times as many as that in grade 8, and the number of students in grade 11 is about two times as many as that in grade K.\n- What's more, the difference between the number of students in grades 9 and 10 is not large, indicating a relatively stable enrollment number within these grades.\n- However, the table does

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to assist a reader in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the periods presented. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the other sections contained herein. References to the Company and the Bank throughout MD&A are made using the first person notations of we\u201d, us\u201d or our\u201d.\n2015 OVERVIEW\nThe Company's net income was $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net income of $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe change in net income for the comparative periods was primarily impacted by:\n \u25cf Pretax net income increased by $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The primary reason for this increase was the effect of the FNSC and Metropolitan acquisitions in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, include the results of operations of First National and Heritage Bank for the entire year, whereas in 2014 the Company's results of operations included the results of operations for First National and Heritage Bank only for the period from June 14 through December 31, 2014. The results of operations of Metropolitan were included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company beginning October 1, 2015. \n \u25cf The provision for income taxes increased $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The primary reason for this increase was the Company's recognition of an income tax benefit in 2014 resulting from the reversal of $21.1 million of the Company's valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset on the basis of management's assessment of the amount of its deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. \n \u25cf The Company paid approximately $1.2 million in fees related to the termination of existing core data processing and online banking contracts of Metropolitan in 2015 compared to $3.0 million in fees related to the termination of similar contracts of FNSC during of 2014. \n \u25cf The Company's election in the second quarter of 2014 to retire certain pension liabilities of the Company's multiemployer defined benefit plan resulted in a charge of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, that did not recur in 2015. \n \u25cf The Company's net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 3.88% compared to 3.84% for the same period in 2014. \n \u25cf The yield on interest-earning assets decreased to 4.33% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 4.37% for the same period in 2014. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.53% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 0.60% for the same period in 2014. \n \u25cf The Company's noninterest expenses generally increased in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to the addition of the operations of the former First National and Heritage Bank for the full year of 2015 as well as Metropolitan beginning October 1, 2015. The increases were due both to normal operating expenses and continued integration costs. \nACQUISITIONS\nMetropolitan National Bank\nOn October 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Metropolitan from Marshfield Investment Company ( Marshfield\u201d). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Metropolitan and Marshfield received proceeds of approximately $70 million, consisting of 4,610,317 shares of Company common stock valued at approximately $42 million and $28 million in cash. The Company paid $10.1 million of the total cash consideration and Metropolitan paid $17.9 million of the total cash consideration in conjunction with the closing of the acquisition. As of December 31, 2015, Metropolitan conducted business from twelve full service locations throughout Southwest Missouri and one loan production office in Joplin, Missouri and had total assets of $455.5 million. On February 19, 2016, Metropolitan was merged with the charter of Bear State Bank, N.A.\nFirst National Security Company\nThe Company completed its merger with FNSC and its accompanying acquisition of FNSC's subsidiaries, including First National and Heritage Bank, on June 13, 2014. On February 13, 2015, First Federal Bank, First National and Heritage Bank were consolidated into a single charter forming Bear State Bank, N.A. The Company has achieved significant operational and organizational improvements as a result of the charter consolidation and technology integration, the benefits of which the Company began to realize in the second quarter of 2015.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn February 19, 2016, the Company converted Metropolitan's systems to the Company's core technology platform, and merged Metropolitan's charter into Bear State Bank. In addition to the Metropolitan integration project, the Company has evaluated its branch network and intends to reduce its total retail branches by up to six. The Company anticipates the integration and branch consolidation project to be substantially completed by the second quarter of 2016.\nOn February 3, 2016, the Company purchased through one broker in an unsolicited single block trade 448,068 shares of its common stock for a cash purchase price of $8.05 per share, or an aggregate purchase price for all of the shares of approximately $3.6 million. The repurchase was specially approved by the board of directors of the Company, including all of its independent directors, and is in addition to, and will not reduce, the remaining capacity under the Company's existing share repurchase program previously announced on March 13, 2015, and as amended on June 19, 2015 (the 2015 Repurchase Program\u201d). As of February 3, 2016, the Company's remaining capacity under the 2015 Repurchase Program was approximately $1.7 million.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nVarious elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. These policies and the judgments, estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of this MD&A and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. In particular, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d generally describes our accounting policies. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of our Consolidated Financial Statements to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition.\nDetermination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d). In estimating the amount of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, various judgments and assumptions are made. For example, when assessing the condition of the overall economic environment, assumptions are made regarding market conditions and their impact on the loan portfolio. In the event the economy were to sustain a prolonged downturn, the loss factors applied to our portfolios may need to be revised, which may significantly impact the measurement of the ALLL. For impaired loans that are collateral dependent and for REO, the estimated fair value of the collateral may deviate significantly from the proceeds received when the collateral is sold.\nAcquired loan amounts deemed uncollectible at acquisition date become part of the fair value calculation and are excluded from the ALLL. Quarterly reviews are completed on acquired loans to determine if changes in estimated cash flows have occurred. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected may result in a provision for loan and lease losses with a corresponding increase in the ALLL. Subsequent increases in the amount expected to be collected result in a reversal of any previously recorded provision for loan and lease losses and the related ALLL, if any, or prospective adjustment to the accretable yield if no provision for loan and lease losses had been recorded.\nAcquired Loans. Acquired loans and leases are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. No allowance for loan and lease losses is recorded on the acquisition date as the fair value of the acquired assets incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. The fair value adjustment on acquired loans without evidence of credit deterioration since origination will be accreted into earnings as a yield adjustment using the level yield method over the remaining life of the loan.\nAcquired loans and leases with evidence of credit deterioration since origination such that it is probable at acquisition that the Bank will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the guidance in ASC Topic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. As of the acquisition date, the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected is the nonaccretable difference, which is included as a reduction of the carrying amount of acquired loans and leases. If the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable, any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the asset's remaining life using a level yield method.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Under acquisition accounting, if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of its net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer's balance sheet as goodwill. An intangible asset is recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if it arises from contractual or other legal rights or if it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. Intangible assets are identifiable assets, such as core deposit intangibles, resulting from acquisitions which are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life and evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that may trigger a decline in the value of the reporting unit or otherwise indicate that a potential impairment exists. Potential impairment of goodwill exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. To the extent the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill will be determined. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and is written down to the implied fair value. The loss recognized is limited to the carrying amount of goodwill. Once an impairment loss is recognized, future increases in fair value will not result in the reversal of previously recognized losses.\nValuation of real estate owned. Fair value is estimated through current appraisals, real estate brokers' opinions or listing prices. As these properties are actively marketed, estimated fair values may be adjusted by management to reflect current economic and market conditions. The estimated fair value of the collateral may deviate significantly from the proceeds received when the collateral is sold.\nValuation of investment securities. The Company has classified all of its investment securities as available for sale. Accordingly, its investment securities are stated at estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements with unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity with any related changes included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company utilizes independent third parties as its principal sources for determining fair value of its investment securities that are measured on a recurring basis. For investment securities traded in an active market, the fair values are based on quoted market prices if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on market prices for comparable securities, broker quotes or comprehensive interest rate tables, pricing matrices or a combination thereof. For investment securities traded in a market that is not active, fair value is determined using unobservable inputs. The fair values of the Company's investment securities traded in both active and inactive markets can be volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors including market interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates, credit quality of the issuer, general market conditions including market liquidity conditions and other factors. Factors and conditions are constantly changing and fair values could be subject to material variations that may significantly impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nValuation of deferred tax assets. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability using a consistent approach that considers the relative impact of negative and positive evidence, including our historical profitability and projections of future taxable income. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management-approved business plans and ongoing tax planning strategies. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between our projected operating performance, our actual results and other factors.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet Interest Income. The Company's results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income for 2015 was $54.5 million compared to $37.4 million in 2014. The increase in net interest income resulted from changes in interest income and interest expense discussed below.\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2015 was $60.8 million compared to $42.5 million in 2014. The increase in interest income in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increases in the average balances of loans receivable and investment securities as a result of the FNSC and Metropolitan acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned on loans receivable.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for 2015 was $6.4 million compared to $5.1 million in 2014. The increase in interest expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in the average balances of deposit accounts and borrowings due to the acquisitions of FNSC and Metropolitan, partially offset by a decrease in the average rate paid on deposits.\nRate/Volume Analysis. The table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the periods indicated. For each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (changes in average volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior average volume); (iii) changes in rate-volume (changes in rate multiplied by the change in average volume); and (iv) the net change.\n\n\nAverage Balance Sheets. The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company's average balance sheets and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing interest income or interest expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Average balances are based on daily balances during the periods.\n\n________________\n(1) Includes nonaccrual loans.\n(2) Includes FRB and FHLB stock.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses represents the amount added to the ALLL for the purpose of maintaining the ALLL at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of the ALLL is evaluated quarterly by management of the Bank based on the Bank's past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral and other qualitative factors.\nManagement determined that a provision for loan losses of $1.8 million was required for the year ended December 31, 2015, to maintain the ALLL at an adequate level. Management determined the necessity of the provision and the amount thereof taking into consideration (i) loans originated by the Bank during the period, (ii) changes in the overall portfolio of nonperforming and classified loans of the Bank, (iii) the credit quality of the Bank's loan portfolio, (iv) ALLL coverage of classified loans and (v) discount balance of acquired loans. The ALLL as a percentage of loans receivable was 1.0% at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.3% at December 31, 2014. The ALLL plus the discount on acquired loans as a percentage of total loans receivable gross of the acquired loan discount was 2.1% at December 31, 2015, compared to 2.4% at December 31, 2014. The ALLL as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 75.23% at December 31, 2015, compared to 139.8% at December 31, 2014. The ALLL as a percentage of classified loans was 29.22% at December 31, 2015, compared to 38.8% at December 31, 2014. See Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d in the Asset Quality\u201d section. A quarterly review is completed on purchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans to determine if changes in estimated cash flows have occurred. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected may result in a provision for loan and lease losses with a corresponding increase in the ALLL.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income is generated primarily through deposit account fee income, profit on sale of loans, and earnings on life insurance policies. Total noninterest income increased $3.5 million to $13.5 million for 2015 compared to $10.0 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to increases in deposit fee income and earnings on life insurance policies attributable to the acquisitions of FNSC and Metropolitan.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense consists primarily of employee compensation and benefits, data processing expense, office occupancy expense, real estate owned expense, and other operating expense. Total noninterest expense increased $8.9 million to $51.0 million in 2015 compared to $42.1 million in 2014. The variances in certain noninterest expense items are further explained in the following paragraphs, with the aggregate expense increase being primarily related to the increase in employee compensation expense, net occupancy expense and other expenses related to the acquisitions and integration of FNSC and Metropolitan. The Company expects that it will incur additional expenses related to its acquisition and integration of Metropolitan during the first quarter of 2016.\nSalaries and Employee Benefits. Salaries and employee benefits increased $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to an increase in personnel attributable to the acquisitions of FNSC and Metropolitan, offset by a decrease in defined benefit pension expense. The decrease in defined benefit pension expense was primarily due to a non-recurring charge of $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2014 due to the Company's election to retire certain pension liabilities of the Company's multiemployer defined benefit plan. The changes in the composition of this line item are presented below (in thousands):\n\nNet Occupancy Expense. The increase in net occupancy expense of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily related to the acquisitions of FNSC and Metropolitan.\nReal Estate Owned, net. The changes in the composition of this line item are presented below (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in loss provisions on real estate owned ( REO\u201d) for 2015 compared to 2014 is due to the Company's review of REO properties in the second and third quarters of 2014 and its decision to more aggressively market certain properties, resulting in 2014 REO losses. Minimal additional provisions were needed in 2015 above those previously recorded. REO expenses such as taxes, insurance and maintenance as well as rental income are expected to continue to decline as the size of the REO portfolio decreases. Future levels of loss provisions and net gains or losses on sales of REO will depend on market conditions. The acquisition of FNSC and Metropolitan had no material impact on REO, net.\nAdvertising and Public Relations. The increase in advertising and public relations expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 of $1.2 million was primarily due to expenses related to the acquisition and integration of FNSC, rebranding expenses associated with the name change of the combined bank during the first quarter of 2015, and the acquisition of Metropolitan in the fourth quarter of 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, the charters of First Federal Bank, First National and Heritage Bank were merged into a single bank charter forming Bear State Bank, N.A. The Company expects that it will incur additional expenses related to its acquisition and rebranding associated with the name change of Metropolitan during the first quarter of 2016.\nOther Noninterest Expenses. Other noninterest expense increased $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the acquisition and integration of FNSC and the recent acquisition of Metropolitan. The changes in other noninterest expenses are presented below (in thousands):\n\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a tax benefit of $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2014, the Company recorded a valuation allowance reversal of $21.1 million on the basis of management's assessment of the amount of its deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.\nLending Activities\nLoan Composition. The following table sets forth certain data relating to the composition of the Bank's loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated.\n\nTotal loans receivable increased $403.0 million to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase in total loans receivable was primarily due to the acquisition of Metropolitan, with $363.3 million of the Company's consolidated total loans receivable at December 31, 2015 attributable to Metropolitan loan balances.\nLoan Concentrations. Loan concentrations are defined as loans to borrowers engaged in similar business-related activities, which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. We regularly monitor these concentrations in order to consider adjustments in our lending practices. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there was no concentration of loans within any portfolio category to any group of borrowers engaged in similar activities or in a similar business that exceeded 10% of total loans.\nLoan Maturity and Interest Rates. The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 2015, regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the Bank's loan portfolios based on their contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans and loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. All other loans are included in the period in which the final contractual repayment is due.\n\n(1) Gross of unearned discounts and net deferred loan costs and the ALLL.\nThe following table sets forth the dollar amount of the Bank's loans at December 31, 2015, due after one year from such date which have fixed interest rates or which have floating or adjustable interest rates.\n\n(1) Gross of unearned discounts and net deferred loan costs and the ALLL.\nScheduled contractual maturities of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual term of the Bank's loan portfolios. The average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their average contractual terms because of loan prepayments.\nASSET QUALITY\nLoans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is 90 days past due or, in the judgment of management, the probability of the full collection of principal and interest is deemed to be sufficiently uncertain to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. Loans may be reinstated to accrual status when payments are made to bring the loan current and, in the opinion of management, full collection of the remaining principal and interest can be reasonably expected. The Bank may continue to accrue interest on certain loans that are 90 days past due or more if such loans are well secured and in the process of collection.\nReal estate properties acquired through foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair value is typically determined based on the lower of a current appraised value or management's estimate of the net realizable value based on the listing price of", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to assist a reader in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the periods presented. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the other sections contained herein. References to the Company and the Bank throughout MD&A are made using the first person notations of we\u201d, us\u201d or our\u201d.\n2015 OVERVIEW\nThe Company's net income was $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net income of $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe change in net income for the comparative periods was primarily impacted by:\n \u25cf Pretax net income increased by $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The primary reason for this increase was the effect of the FNSC and Metropolitan acquisitions in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, include the results of operations of First National and Heritage Bank for the entire year, whereas in 2014 the Company's results of operations included the results of operations for First National and Heritage Bank only for the period from June 14 through December 31, 2014. The results of operations of Metropolitan were included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company beginning October 1, 2015. \n \u25cf The provision for income taxes increased $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The primary reason for this increase was the Company's recognition of an income tax benefit in 2014 resulting from the reversal of $21.1 million of the Company's valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset on the basis of management's assessment of the amount of its deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. \n \u25cf The Company paid approximately $1.2 million in fees related to the termination of existing core data processing and online banking contracts of Metropolitan in 2015 compared to $3.0 million in fees related to the termination of similar contracts of FNSC during of 2014. \n \u25cf The Company's election in the second quarter of 2014 to retire certain pension liabilities of the Company's multiemployer defined benefit plan resulted in a charge of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, that did not recur in 2015. \n \u25cf The Company's net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 3.88% compared to 3.84% for the same period in 2014. \n \u25cf The yield on interest-earning assets decreased to 4.33% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 4.37% for the same period in 2014. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.53% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 0.60% for the same period in 2014. \n \u25cf The Company's noninterest expenses generally increased in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to the addition of the operations of the former First National and Heritage Bank for the full year of 2015 as well as Metropolitan beginning October 1, 2015. The increases were due both to normal operating expenses and continued integration costs. \nACQUISITIONS\nMetropolitan National Bank\nOn October 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Metropolitan from Marshfield Investment Company ( Marshfield\u201d). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Metropolitan and Marshfield received proceeds of approximately $70 million, consisting of 4,610,317 shares of Company common stock valued at approximately $42 million and $28 million in cash. The Company paid $10.1 million of the total cash consideration and Metropolitan paid $17.9 million of the total cash consideration in conjunction with the closing of the acquisition. As of December 31, 2015, Metropolitan conducted business from twelve full service locations throughout Southwest Missouri and one loan production office in Joplin, Missouri and had total assets of $455.5 million. On February 19, 2016, Metropolitan was merged with the charter of Bear State Bank, N.A.\nFirst National Security Company\nThe Company completed its merger with FNSC and its accompanying acquisition of FNSC's subsidiaries, including First National and Heritage Bank, on June 13, 2014. On February 13, 2015, First Federal Bank, First National and Heritage Bank were consolidated into a single charter forming Bear State Bank, N.A. The Company has achieved significant operational and organizational improvements as a result of the charter consolidation and technology integration, the benefits of which the Company began to realize in the second quarter of 2015.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn February 19, 2016, the Company converted Metropolitan's systems to the Company's core technology platform, and merged Metropolitan's charter into Bear State Bank. In addition to the Metropolitan integration project, the Company has evaluated its branch network and intends to reduce its total retail branches by up to six. The Company anticipates the integration and branch consolidation project to be substantially completed by the second quarter of 2016.\nOn February 3, 2016, the Company purchased through one broker in an unsolicited single block trade 448,068 shares of its common stock for a cash purchase price of $8.05 per share, or an aggregate purchase price for all of the shares of approximately $3.6 million. The repurchase was specially approved by the board of directors of the Company, including all of its independent directors, and is in addition to, and will not reduce, the remaining capacity under the Company's existing share repurchase program previously announced on March 13, 2015, and as amended on June 19, 2015 (the 2015 Repurchase Program\u201d). As of February 3, 2016, the Company's remaining capacity under the 2015 Repurchase Program was approximately $1.7 million.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nVarious elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. These policies and the judgments, estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of this MD&A and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. In particular, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d generally describes our accounting policies. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of our Consolidated Financial Statements to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition.\nDetermination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d). In estimating the amount of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, various judgments and assumptions are made. For example, when assessing the condition of the overall economic environment, assumptions are made regarding market conditions and their impact on the loan portfolio. In the event the economy were to sustain a prolonged downturn, the loss factors applied to our portfolios may need to be revised, which may significantly impact the measurement of the ALLL. For impaired loans that are collateral dependent and for REO, the estimated fair value of the collateral may deviate significantly from the proceeds received when the collateral is sold.\nAcquired loan amounts deemed uncollectible at acquisition date become part of the fair value calculation and are excluded from the ALLL. Quarterly reviews are completed on acquired loans to determine if changes in estimated cash flows have occurred. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected may result in a provision for loan and lease losses with a corresponding increase in the ALLL. Subsequent increases in the amount expected to be collected result in a reversal of any previously recorded provision for loan and lease losses and the related ALLL, if any, or prospective adjustment to the accretable yield if no provision for loan and lease losses had been recorded.\nAcquired Loans. Acquired loans and leases are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. No allowance for loan and lease losses is recorded on the acquisition date as the fair value of the acquired assets incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. The fair value adjustment on acquired loans without evidence of credit deterioration since origination will be accreted into earnings as a yield adjustment using the level yield method over the remaining life of the loan.\nAcquired loans and leases with evidence of credit deterioration since origination such that it is probable at acquisition that the Bank will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the guidance in ASC Topic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. As of the acquisition date, the difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected is the nonaccretable difference, which is included as a reduction of the carrying amount of acquired loans and leases. If the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable, any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the asset's remaining life using a level yield method.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Under acquisition accounting, if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of its net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer's balance sheet as goodwill. An intangible asset is recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if it arises from contractual or other legal rights or if it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. Intangible assets are identifiable assets, such as core deposit intangibles, resulting from acquisitions which are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life and evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that may trigger a decline in the value of the reporting unit or otherwise indicate that a potential impairment exists. Potential impairment of goodwill exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. To the extent the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill will be determined. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and is written down to the implied fair value. The loss recognized is limited to the carrying amount of goodwill. Once an impairment loss is recognized, future increases in fair value will not result in the reversal of previously recognized losses.\nValuation of real estate owned. Fair value is estimated through current appraisals, real estate brokers' opinions or listing prices. As these properties are actively marketed, estimated fair values may be adjusted by management to reflect current economic and market conditions. The estimated fair value of the collateral may deviate significantly from the proceeds received when the collateral is sold.\nValuation of investment securities. The Company has classified all of its investment securities as available for sale. Accordingly, its investment securities are stated at estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements with unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity with any related changes included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company utilizes independent third parties as its principal sources for determining fair value of its investment securities that are measured on a recurring basis. For investment securities traded in an active market, the fair values are based on quoted market prices if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on market prices for comparable securities, broker quotes or comprehensive interest rate tables, pricing matrices or a combination thereof. For investment securities traded in a market that is not active, fair value is determined using unobservable inputs. The fair values of the Company's investment securities traded in both active and inactive markets can be volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors including market interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates, credit quality of the issuer, general market conditions including market liquidity conditions and other factors. Factors and conditions are constantly changing and fair values could be subject to material variations that may significantly impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nValuation of deferred tax assets. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability using a consistent approach that considers the relative impact of negative and positive evidence, including our historical profitability and projections of future taxable income. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management-approved business plans and ongoing tax planning strategies. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between our projected operating performance, our actual results and other factors.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet Interest Income. The Company's results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income for 2015 was $54.5 million compared to $37.4 million in 2014. The increase in net interest income resulted from changes in interest income and interest expense discussed below.\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2015 was $60.8 million compared to $42.5 million in 2014. The increase in interest income in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increases in the average balances of loans receivable and investment securities as a result of the FNSC and Metropolitan acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned on loans receivable.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for 2015 was $6.4 million compared to $5.1 million in 2014. The increase in interest expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in the average balances of deposit accounts and borrowings due to the acquisitions of FNSC and Metropolitan, partially offset by a decrease in the average rate paid on deposits.\nRate/Volume Analysis. The table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the periods indicated. For each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (changes in average volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior average volume); (iii) changes in rate-volume (changes in rate multiplied by the change in average volume); and (iv) the net change.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>

nonaccrual loans.\n(2) Includes FRB and FHLB stock.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses represents the amount added to the ALLL for the purpose of maintaining the ALLL at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of the ALLL is evaluated quarterly by management of the Bank based on the Bank's past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral and other qualitative factors.\nManagement determined that a provision for loan losses of $1.8 million was required for the year ended December 31, 2015, to maintain the ALLL at an adequate level. Management determined the necessity of the provision and the amount thereof taking into consideration (i) loans originated by the Bank during the period, (ii) changes in the overall portfolio of nonperforming and classified loans of the Bank, (iii) the credit quality of the Bank's loan portfolio, (iv) ALLL coverage of classified loans and (v) discount balance of acquired loans. The ALLL as a percentage of loans receivable was 1.0% at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.3% at December 31, 2014. The ALLL plus the discount on acquired loans as a percentage of total loans receivable gross of the acquired loan discount was 2.1% at December 31, 2015, compared to 2.4% at December 31, 2014. The ALLL as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 75.23% at December 31, 2015, compared to 139.8% at December 31, 2014. The ALLL as a percentage of classified loans was 29.22% at December 31, 2015, compared to 38.8% at December 31, 2014. See Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d in the Asset Quality\u201d section. A quarterly review is completed on purchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans to determine if changes in estimated cash flows have occurred. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected may result in a provision for loan and lease losses with a corresponding increase in the ALLL.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income is generated primarily through deposit account fee income, profit on sale of loans, and earnings on life insurance policies. Total noninterest income increased $3.5 million to $13.5 million for 2015 compared to $10.0 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to increases in deposit fee income and earnings on life insurance policies attributable to the acquisitions of FNSC and Metropolitan.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense consists primarily of employee compensation and benefits, data processing expense, office occupancy expense, real estate owned expense, and other operating expense. Total noninterest expense increased $8.9 million to $51.0 million in 2015 compared to $42.1 million in 2014. The variances in certain noninterest expense items are further explained in the following paragraphs, with the aggregate expense increase being primarily related to the increase in employee compensation expense, net occupancy expense and other expenses related to the acquisitions and integration of FNSC and Metropolitan. The Company expects that it will incur additional expenses related to its acquisition and integration of Metropolitan during the first quarter of 2016.\nSalaries and Employee Benefits. Salaries and employee benefits increased $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to an increase in personnel attributable to the acquisitions of FNSC and Metropolitan, offset by a decrease in defined benefit pension expense. The decrease in defined benefit pension expense was primarily due to a non-recurring charge of $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2014 due to the Company's election to retire certain pension liabilities of the Company's multiemployer defined benefit plan.

Minimal additional provisions were needed in 2015 above those previously recorded. REO expenses such as taxes, insurance and maintenance as well as rental income are expected to continue to decline as the size of the REO portfolio decreases. Future levels of loss provisions and net gains or losses on sales of REO will depend on market conditions. The acquisition of FNSC and Metropolitan had no material impact on REO, net.\nAdvertising and Public Relations. The increase in advertising and public relations expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 of $1.2 million was primarily due to expenses related to the acquisition and integration of FNSC, rebranding expenses associated with the name change of the combined bank during the first quarter of 2015, and the acquisition of Metropolitan in the fourth quarter of 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, the charters of First Federal Bank, First National and Heritage Bank were merged into a single bank charter forming Bear State Bank, N.A. The Company expects that it will incur additional expenses related to its acquisition and rebranding associated with the name change of Metropolitan during the first quarter of 2016.\nOther Noninterest Expenses. Other noninterest expense increased $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the acquisition and integration of FNSC and the recent acquisition of Metropolitan.
